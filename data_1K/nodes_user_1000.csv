corkyskog,8,2,"I am surprised this doesn't exist yet, maybe because people are worried about taxes. 

I would love to see a poker platform that allows people to create and stake their own tournaments. Whoever guarantees the tournament prize gets the buy in fees. They could create and design every aspect of the game they are staking.

The prize guaranteer would obviously set the prize amount, but they would also get to set the other aspects of the game that they thought would bring in the most players. Like the game **variety** (Hold 'em, Omaha, 7 stud, etc), the game **type** (knockout, quick, large stack, etc), the specific amounts of things like if it's KO what percentage is won and what percentage rolls forward into their bounty. They would set blind increase amounts and even the increments that they change. 

There could be a near infinite different games that could be setup. As someone who was into crypto for a long time and an even longer term poker player, I feel this idea is under capitalized and I don't know why. All the ideas I mentioned are things poker players have been begging for for a long time, and now it can finally be done.Come see the nanner bannanzer [JTV](https://jungletv.live/)No more R, D or I next to candidates names on ballots.

It's a hard choice; everyone keeps trying to warn me away from playing heliod but from what I've seen mono-red is truly horrendous against the sultai delirium deck and inverter only needs to make a few small tweaks to be favored(going from ""no languishes"" to ""some"" seems to be enough). It seems unlikely to me that the deck will perform well at this coming tournament, so I'm leaning towards a heliod combo list that can side in tons of hate against other combo decks and graveyard based decks, both of which seem very common right now.

I've played the game a lot, and recently ran into someone who questioned the way I've been moving monsters. I'm not sure which is correct, so I'd like some input.

Take this situation: http://i.imgur.com/qR39Pcg.png

WL is the White Lion and the S is a survivor and target of an attack. The White Lion begins its movement and must move along the shortest available path to the target.

This player suggested that the legal moves are these and only these: http://i.imgur.com/y5C1Ksw.png
(sorry for the shitty ms paint work). There is one(maybe one or two more, but they're largely irrelevant) decision point where the player decides where the monster goes, but that's it. Essentially, the suggestion was that you should draw a line between the monster and its target and follow that line as closely as possible. (Which is fair wargaming logic, but not mentioned anywhere in the rules)

However, I've been playing such that the following(or any variation thereof) would be a perfectly legal move: http://i.imgur.com/otfTYqV.png

All movements still take the maximum 6 squares and are therefore still the shortest in terms of actual distance traveled.

The rules state that if there are multiple shortest paths the monster controller may choose whichever one they wish; the question is then whether a non-direct path still the shortest if a direct path is available.I've only read two routes so far(Michiru and Yumiko) but it really seems like Yuuji is particularly stupid, even for a teenager. He's got the child soldier thing going on and is good at that obviously, but he suffers from frequent delusions.

Not to mention in Michiru's route, he[](/kajitsu ""nearly kills her without apparently realizing it; sticking her in the ground for 3 days. Long enough to die of dehydration. This is particularly noteworthy because he mentions the importance of hydration MULTIPLE TIMES beforehand."")

Is this ever explored in the other routes or games?Some background; I'm 28. I've wanted to be an actor most of my life, but I suppressed that as an ""unrealistic"" goal.

But unfortunately, I've found that most acting programs only seem interested in accepting freshmen. It's a bit demoralizing, honestly, because it feels like I missed my chance. What can I do about this? What should I be looking for if the typical acting programs are closed off to me?"

https://anchor.fm/soulofatruckpod  *It is a known issues with the Attila campaign at present that the razing mechanic can cause big problems both with immersion and gameplay. Not only does having all of eastern Europe and Caucasian areas as smoldering husks seem unlikely and strange, but it also can severely limit the expansion potential of both the player and potential opponents thus making for less interaction overall in these areas. Potential allies, bloody wars, and bouts of intrigue are left unnecessary when you know the tiny tribe surrounded by razed land will never expand quickly enough for them to pose a threat to you. Conversely, your own progress into the required regions for your factions victory can be hindered severely by having several provinces worth of razed land to retake. Below are just a few of my suggestions to improve this feature, and you are welcome to share your own. I DID submit this about a month ago with little attention, but I'm hoping for more open discussion about razing this time around.*

***

#Natural resettlement and annexation

 In it's current state, razed settlements simply stay razed: a hot, steaming turd of a region that smolders each turn into eternity unless a faction deliberately takes action to resettle. 90% of the time it seems, this is the player. For good reason as well-- normal resettlement in my experience is *AT LEAST 10k* to resettle, and that is *NOT* including rebuilding the settlement buildings themselves. Given this outrageous price, **a simple fix for the short term might involve lowering the price to resettle, especially for non-capitol region. Ie, Roma would be close to the cost it is now to resettle, but Neapolis would be around half of that.**

 Sometimes though, even if a region is surrounded by well-established powers, a region will be forgotten or purposely unsettled by the player to avoid conflict. However, *THIS IS TOTAL WAR!* The whole theme of this iteration is inevitable war and conflict, so why allow these potential border conflicts to never arise? **I think a great mechanic to add would be for these provinces to automatically be resettled or annexed according to a ""cultural influence"" mechanic a la the current religion system.** In theory this would be a status you could check, in fact, the ONLY stat you could inspect on a razed province while it is deserted. Whichever occurs first, whether a culture becomes 100% influential (again based, on your religious influence) or after 5 in-game years (20 turns), the dominant culture resettles that region. One cultural influence will always be present: ""Native"" which would reflect the native population of that region. So, if Corinthus were left untouched after the Visigoths laid waste to it, after 20 turns and no efforts by any of its neighbors, Macedonia would suddenly arise from the ashes.

 Obviously there'd be many nuances to this. Native resettlement would require a full stack for the newly created nation, while annexation would need to be balanced more to prevent free armies or, potentially worse, lame duck regions that either sap your food or eventually create rebel breeding grounds. The mechanics are definitely there though to create such a system that I think would definitely improve the campaign.

## tl;dr: Automatically annex razed regions according to nearby national influences, or, if no one is influential enough, resettle that region to its native culture.

**By my ancestors! Please let me know what you think! I'd love to see CA implement a system at least reminiscent of this, or SOMETHING more effective than simply cutting the razing rate for the first 25 years (100 turns).**

edit: formattingFirst time poster here, not sure where else I might post this

I say ""MDMA-friendly genetics"" to mean both the pros of the drug being stronger while the cons affect me less. Let me clarify with some examples:

* First time I did MDMA my friend (also rolling, forgive them) slipped me .4 thinking it was .1, yet, in addition to rolling my *ASS OFF*, the next day I only felt slightly fatigued then totally fine after some coffee and weed
* Subsequent experiences (~10 times or so since then) have all been positive, even when I roll multiple times in the same week (still don't recommend this, once per month is ideal)
* If I take less than .3, I basically have no negative effects the next day provided I get enough sleep. Some motivational loss, but totally curable with some mental exercise

I just want to know if anyone else is like this when it comes to rolling, particularly the comedown. Am I just the normie among a bunch of friends who are just sensitive, or do I truly have some sort of disposition to handling MDMA well?So I recently took on the Odrysian Kingdom Grand Campaign for a second run, my first attempts ending roughly as described [here](http://redd.it/275iwg) in the top comment. I've finally managed to consolidate Thracia under my rule to begin some real expansion, yet it was not easy or without some big mistakes.

Seeing as a lot of people have been having issues succeeding as Odrysia even in normal mode (myself included), I thought I should share some pointers that seemed to bring me closer to a successful empire and farther from a penniless, collapsing minor faction that is quickly swallowed up by the nearby Greek states with their awesome starting rosters.

--*Mod related material in italics*--

*Firstly, (and some of you might feel this is not a ""true"" tip) I downloaded the [Gold Unit  compilation by champloo](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=268682061). Not only does this save you crucial amounts of money with more native units to recruit in place of expensive mercenary upkeeps, but it also provides you with an army component sorely missed by the starting Odrysian forces: spearmen. Granted, these guys (Light Tribal Spearmen, I believe) are barely better than steppe spears when it comes down to it, but their staying power, however minor, is still better than Thracian Warriors and Peltasts with their ability to make a shieldscreen. They even keep to their Thracian roots by having light armor for mobility and a modest charge (noticeably effective against cav w/ a +15 v Large bonus). For those of you who feel this is a crutch (which I totally understand), I must emphasize my and what I think to be the majority opinion on the matter that vanilla Odrysia has a lackluster roster even with their buffs. My attempts to have a cost-efficient, versatile army, which is what you need given they can only support one army at the start, with the vanilla game have ended in apparently inevitable disaster. It's also important to note that while it makes the functioning of your armies easier, the campaign as a whole is still just as difficult as AI factions will be making some smart decisions with their new unit choices (Greek Thureos Swords are going to give you pains).*

Getting into armies more specifically, I've found that **having your main army be about 12-15 units helps give you the mercenary flexibility for big fights while still keeping your income sufficient**. I say sufficient because your income will not be anything beyond that until you have enough regions to actually diversify your spending beyond agent actions and army recruitment. Though you still need to develop your buildings when you have some breathing room, by no means should you *prioritize* building until the hungry nations surrounding you are either contained or allied to your cause. **Keep your generals as Royal Cav**, you won't be able to recruit them yourself for quite some time and the utility they bring is unmatched to the other general choices. As far as which units to get first, *Light Tribal Spears should not be underestimated for the reasons I mentioned above. I also like* Thracian Cav for their utility in cleaning up enemy missile infantry while still being excellent at softening up and kiting heavy infantry. **If, while fighting for a region, you feel it would be difficult or costly to hold then just sack it and try again later. The increased income from your faction trait will be a large boon for replenishing your army and perhaps even improving it.**

**Mercenaries, while vital to your war effort, should NEVER be kept for more than a single turn if even that long. Preferably you should position yourself to only recruit them right before you attack, then disband them once you win.**

Beyond the glorious war, agents will be your second most important expenditure starting out, especially your spy. **A mass poisoner with some splashes in counter-intelligence is arguably more crucial than your army** because he will stop the Macedonian spy from crippling your only force while doing the same to the enemy. I have prevented at least 3-5 lethal sieges with a timely poisoning of the main stack; the pinnacle example being my chance triumph over a combined Macedonian/Athenian incursion totalling 25 units across 3 generals. **Don't forget to pick up a champion and KEEP YOUR DIGNITARY ALIVE.** His bonus tax income and culture conversion are a huge boon to keeping your focus on the fight and not grumpy citizens and an empty bank account. Your champion's training will also give you a keen edge in close battles.

For politics and research, your focus is already on your military so let your spending reflect that. Keep your family respected, but don't strain too much for anything beyond that. **If it helps you get money (ie, the free promotion to noble with a bonus to the tax rate) then do it but otherwise save your money.** This is essentially the same for research, but make sure you pick up the first few military upgrades for each tree. Civil research should focus primarily on growth, then tax rate, then food. 

Starting buildings are pretty cut and dry since you only have one region. **You don't need really need a navy or naval buildings, so build a fishery and let food be one less thing to worry about.** *Bronze workshop gives you those spearmen I mentioned, money, as well as Thracian nobles once maxed, so get one of those too.*

My war plan itself breaks down into these basic first steps that, while not essential, seemed to make for the safest expansion given the amount of hostility you face at the start:

1) Buddy up with Tylis and Getae ASAP. Getae especially since they'll declare war otherwise plus they have potential to confederate in the future. Once they suddenly betrayed me even though we were friends, but I was able to garner peace the next turn with a modest tribute (500g). Even though its unlikely they'll both stay your friends or even survive, **Tylis' trade and aggressive nature helps keep Macedon at bay while the Getae are more beasts to keep from your doorstep.**

2) The Triballi and the settlement they control, Navissos, is your primary target for expansion. Given their poor starting roster (all levy spears, a juicy target for your warriors) and single region containing a trade resource, I can't think of a better first addition to your empire. **The trick to this is not really beating the Triballi, but defending Navissos better than they did from the many potential encroachers.** Since Odrysian garrisons suck, I kept my spy within range of this settlement as well as a 5 stack army to ward off opportunistic raids. This stack won't stop big armies from bulldozing you though, so that's why you need your spy scouting for big stacks in enemy territories. Just as important, **you should try to ally with the Illyrians to your now western border.** They are eager to trade and are somewhat loyal to their friends, yet overwhelmingly annoying as enemies.

3) Staying in the same vein of thought, keep your fronts to a minimum. The south and southeast is pretty much always going to be a threat with the whole of the Greek states despising you for merely existing (-35 to relations no matter what). If you played smart (and have some luck) the North should stay relatively peaceful with the only aggressors, the Scordisci, either tied up with one the Illyrian states or the Getae. Even better, hash out some defensive alliances to dissuade the devious Greeks from attempting to snatch an undefended settlement.

I know this a wall of text that may be a bit scatterbrained at points, and the RNG has a lot to do with how some of these tactics work out. However for my experience with this campaign the above strategy seemed to be the safest in making up for the drastic disadvantages one must handle at the rocky start of this campaign. By all means, if you think you had a tactic or full strategy that worked more reliably please share it! As interesting of a faction as Odrysia is, I'd love to see more people sharing success stories and empires forged from such a crucible.

TL;DR:

* 1) SAVE MONEY WHERE YOU CAN
* 2) FOCUS SPENDING ON MILITARY AND AGENTS, DON'T KEEP MERCS
* 3) RESEARCH FOR BETTER, CHEAPER TROOPS AND GROWTH
* 4) MAKE FRIENDS WHERE YOU CAN
* 5) PRAY TO SABAZIOSHey, all, I just wanted to see if any of y'all out there had any special tactics you used to keep your pigs from spreading their hay all over the floor or just plain ignoring it. Don't worry: my pigs all eat their hay just fine, but about 50% of it either falls on the ground where they pee on it or gets ignored once they've picked out what I can only imagine are, ""the good parts"" for them.


I've had some mild success with shifting the hay still in the bale around a bit and mixing it with just a bit of fresh hay. They seem to be more interested in giving it a second chance from the smell, I believe. What about y'all? Do you guys just accept the mess and move on, or do you have any solutions to keep peegs from being so picky?So in the current state of the campaign a common complaint and obvious flaw in the immersion is the abundance of razed land towards the middle/end of the timeline. While mods are always an option in terms of modifying this problem, I think most would agree that we'd like to see an official CA fix for the overly persistent nature of razed settlements. 

My suggestion is similar to the current system in place for returning fertility to razed areas, but with actual factions forming to fully resettle the land as well. I think it would work best if they formed in a manner similar to rebellions, but instead of taking 20 units to full resettle the town they resettle one province immediately with only a few units (5-8 plus garrison). Major factions could only re-emerge in their former capital after a very long time (15 in game years), minor factions would reform after a decade or so. The key issue I could see with this is having a faction that supremely hated you suddenly reforming in a wasteland and quickly snatching up a bunch of provinces before you could react, so that's why I think it would work best with long periods to re-establish former kingdoms since then players can have the time to make ready for a return or resettle that place entirely.

The resettled land itself would come with several buffs so that the fledgling kingdom has *some* chance of re-establishing itself entirely. Mainly having undamaged, tier 2 buildings upon resettlement as well as buffed income (which is already a thing for most AI already) for the first few years of its existence. If necessary they could even have bonus recruitment slots and cheaper upkeep since the impoverished peoples of the land are looking for a sanctuary. 

Some additional variables that might make this even more immersive and exciting is if the diplomacy of the new kingdom reflected the recent events surrounding its creation. Have a frontier settlement with low public order and being raided, or worse, you abandoned an ally to burn? Desperate refugees fleeing the conflict then flock to the fresh, unsullied banner of the emergent power-- with little love for their former, negligent masters and allies. Maybe the land was simply torn apart by the ravaging Huns and no nearby powers were able to resettle the land themselves? Then the resident population of that province, calculated somehow related to the former population and the amount of immigration from nearby lands, naturally would select new leaders and organize into a neutral, yet likely ambitious new government to seek glory of their own. I couldn't think of a situation where a faction would reform and be friendly to any empire currently existing.

Of course this is just my idea, the main point of this thread is for some proactive discussion and general ideas for a better, more immersive campaign when it comes to razed land.So my girlfriend and I have acquired a sizeable C&C cage, and we thought it appropriate to fill in the extra space with two new buddies for our current pair, Cherry and Daisy. Cherry is very dominant and attention-seeking (she will get jealous easily), yet Daisy is almost completely submissive.

The main question on our minds was whether to get both new pigs at once or one at a time-- what would make for an easier adjustment for our current pigs? Also, are there any gender pairings that are out of the question or just difficult to manage in one cage? We already know any boars will need to be neutered, but can there be one neutered boy amongst three girls? Two and two? So many possibilities!

Thanks in advance for your suggestions. Cherry and Daisy both appreciate the advice!**GANESHA- Hindu God of Intellect** UPDATED: 11/14

**ABILITIES**

* Passive: *Sacred Being*: Ganesha is Aum, the primal sound of existence, incarnate. He gains +5 MP5 and +3 HP5 per allied God
living, and the closer you are to Ganesha, the more protections he gives. 7-10ft: 10, 3-6ft: 20, 0-2ft: 30

* 1: *Vighnakarta*: Ganesha summons an obstacle to hinder his enemies or aid his allies. Obstacles summoned on foes will appear directly in front of them, while those summoned on teammates will spawn behind them. The obstacle may be desummoned at any time. Lasts 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2s

Animation: Ganesh claps his front 2 hands into prayer,while his rear arms contort in a summoning flourish. The wall instantaneously coalesces on his target player as a shimmering, psychic wall of floating,scrolling Sanskrit

Flavorspeech: Enemy:""YOU...SHALL NOT...PASS!!""(~~Did I make it in time for this to still be funny??~~) Any:""I cannot knowingly allow this!"" Friend:""I will aid you!""

* 2: *Pervasive Intellect*: Ganesha discloses the weaknesses of his enemies to his allies within 10ft, increasing penetration by 5/7/10/12/15 (+7.5% your PP).

Animation: Ganesha trumpets immaculately and swings his weapons in the air, sending a sound wave the distance of its effect. Allies affected have a Hindi flair surrounding their feet.

* 3: *Broken Tusk Sweep*: Ganesha sweeps a cone in front of him with his trunk knocking all enemies back and dealing 
75/120/175/225/265 (+85% your PP) damage.

Animation: Ganesha grunts angrily, sweeping his great trunk along the ground and extending his front arms to the side to allow his head room to swing, while his rear arms raise fists of righteous vindication.
Flavorspeech: ""Back-sweep-, you wretches!"" OR ""Allow me to ACT-sweep-on that thought!""

* 4: *Buddhipriya*: Ganesha's wisdom knows no bounds, and he uses his wisdom as best fits the battle at hand. Every 45s Ganesha may either give a 7.5ft radius of true sight to any non-base area on the map, reduce all damage from a single enemy by 50%, or heal all allies within 10ft 100/200/300/400/500 (+30% your Dmg mitigation).

Animation (1): Ganesha eyes begin to burn a ghostly, irridescent white while his arms form into a typical Deva pose. The revealed area is marked by conspicuous Hindi flair around its circumference.
Animation (2): Eyes burning the same, Ganesha focuses all of his arms into one cosmic blast, and the enemy God struck would suddenly appear sundered and dull, as his/her power is suppressed.
Animation (3): Burning white eyes, Ganesha juts all of his limbs out simultaneously, creating a lifeforcewave that washes over nearby allies giving them an effect very similar to Shield's HP5 proc.

Flavorspeech: ""Aummm....""

**[MODEL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ganesha_Basohli_miniature_circa_1730_Dubost_p73.jpg)**

Ganesha sits cross-legged upon a great lotus, which is in turn sat atop an *incredibly* strong mouse, who is difficult to be spotted beneath the massive Ganesha, except for the obvious tipping and bobbing the lotus does atop the small creature. When jumping, Ganesha, the lotus, and the mouse all separate mid-air.

**OVERVIEW**

*IRL Junk*

Honestly, if it weren't for my suspicion that Hi-Rez is hesitant to accidentally anger the very real religious communities currently surrounding Ganesha, I would say I'm surprised that so iconic of a Deva was not already included among Smite's already impressive roster. That said, I have tried to make his kit and overall feel to be respectful to their deity, while still (in part) sticking to the tongue-in-cheek approach to God models. I would say further that his ""defeat"" animation would need to be something similar to this (ie, Vamana closing eyes and floating away/ Guan Yu's old animation of contemplation then POOF!)

*Metagame*

Ganesha is designed as a carry-style Guardian. His kit is practically half CC, half buffs, and given a competent enough player, he will shine as a natural leader for group tactics and integrity. Though I'm sure there are those of you cowering in fear of a tank who can crit, in the current state of the game there are no items which give both protections and crit chance, and crits are not nearly as scary when they have very little dedicated PP to back them up.

AlphaApache,4,5,"As a jungle main i feel like i need to adress this concidering the existing pool of champions that falls into the jungler category. It's been 9 months since the last one was released and keep in mind that most of them aren't even played due to the meta shifting.

The most *recent* junglers released:

* **Aatrox** release date: 2013-06-13 (~9 months ago)

* **Zac** release date: 2013-03-29 (~11 months ago)

* **Vi** release date: 2012-12-19 (~14 months ago)

Currently there are about 6 junglers you have to choose from; Kha'Zix, Wukong, Vi, Pantheon, Lee Sin, Elise.

(which presupposes that you want to play the strongest ones in order to have the highest chances of winning)

Either buff older junglers slightly to make them more up to par with the strongest ones or release a new one. [ooooooooor](http://imgur.com/c7NJRa2?tags)

And while we're at it, supports also need some attention! (Thresh, the latest support, was released 12 months ago) 

Edit: A lot of people are saying that ""there are more than 6 junglers to choose from"". I'm aware there are other strong picks out there. The ones i listed are simply the most played in competitive and higher level of play, since in solo queue you can basically play whatever"
ViolentWanderer,2,7,"By the time we got kicked off the court by the next two people who had the court after us, i was leading 40-30, 6-5. We didn't get to play out the final point. Probably for the best cos I would've choked on that too. 

To make it worse, the guy was playing for the first time since breaking his ankle and recovering from it. When we walked off he said ""for the better, I probably would've lost that."" I just felt so disappointed in myself. Like a professional choker. I know it was just a friendly game amongst friends...but it still got to me.

Halfway down is a beam you can land on and there's a chest behind you with a portal to take you back up. The second chest is after the ogre boss. When you get to the room with four hive wizards and an elevator go over to the right side and use a queens tincture to reveal some invisible platforms you can follow to the second chest. I don't know if these chests can drop the dungeon exclusive perks since I don't even know what they are, but the armor has all been high stat rolls so I assume they can.https://imgur.com/a/ooPZF

Edit: That should be everything now if you refresh.

Edit 2: [Bonus Season 2 clan banner](https://i.imgur.com/o9jGiXj.png)Year 1, while rolls were static, had a lot archetype variety covered in each slot. Although this may be some weird nostalgia bias since I know Year 1 had a ton of 900 rpm energy SMG and no 600s i can recall. Year 2 hit and we got random rolls, but archetypes were lacking in certain categories and they still kind of are. This had honestly been my biggest gripe with vendor refreshes or the lack there of since. Take 150 kinetic hand cannons for example. Midnight Coup reigned as the king for all of year 1, Season of the Outlaw, and Season of the Forge before Spare Rations dethroned it. Even then it wasn't easily acquired so many stuck with the coup. Now look at things like Kinetic grenade launchers. Three exist in the whole game, and after next season the only non-sunset option we know is an exotic. Even currently one is a grindfest PvP pinnacle, the other only available temporarily while its a featured Nightfall. This in my opinion put a strain on special weapon options in the kinetic slot as it really came down to a shotgun or sniper if you didn't grind a kinetic GL. Even then those weapon types usually felt like they had few options in kinetic variety. Shotguns mostly had Toil and Trouble, Dust Rock Blues, Parcel of Stardust, and Threat Level with snipers mostly having Long Shadow. Even now at this moment we have six current kinetic slot legendary snipers Long Shadow, Supremacy, Bite of the Fox, Dreaded Venture, Show of Force, and Tranquility.  Compared to 14 energy options. This isn't even taking archetypes into consideration where half of them are aggressive frame snipers, and only one is a rapidfire frame in the kinetic slot. There's even more odd man out archetypes though like 260 Scouts. There's only ever been one kinetic 260, a single energy 260 exotic, and only one randomly rolled energy option. Next season only the exotic will remain as a non-sunset option as far as we know. Another thing since Forsaken we've only received one 600 rpm kinetic Auto rifle. Kinetic 720 rpm auto rifles would also only see one option available, and only during Season of the Dawn with Steelfeather Repeater. Moving to pulse rifles Bygones is the only kinetic adaptive since Forsaken. There are no randomly rolled Rapidfire kinetic pulses that i know of even. While aggressive burst has only ever had one energy slot option out of four total ever existing. Yet another example is 750 rpm SMGs. We've had two random roll kinetic options with Hard Truths, and the limited time event only Cold Front, but we only got a randomly rolled 750 rpm energy smg just this season with the updated Ikelos SMG. Although the best example of this fear that things will sunset and fall out of style like the year 1 to year 2 transition, and one archetype will become oversaturated like 150 rpm scout rifles in Forsaken while others continue to be forgotten.

Sorry for ranting on. I can't sleep, and I just feel like I've never seen a big topic on this specifically, but it's been an issue in the lack of vendor refreshes, and sunsetting to me for a little while.Just thought I'd let everyone know. They also have a pistol that requires you to join each faction at least once while the ship requires joining the same faction three times.

P.S. Maybe throw the Crimson Days stuff into the Eververse rotation and Bright Engrams too if it isn't asking much.I've seen some confusion, and had some myself. After a few hours grinding crucible yesterday I finally got my quest finished so I thought I'd help out anyone who's struggling or just plain bad at PvP like me.

Step 1.) Scout Rifle kills. This is just 450 scout rifle final blows. You need to get the final hit as assists don't count, and despite what the quest step says double kills don't get any bonus progress. So just pick a scout you're comfortable with and grind them out. If you have Jade Rabbit and the catalyst it's a good time to knock out both.

Step 2.) Acquire 2100 glory in comp playlists. This is straight forward. Just gain glory by playing Survival. If you're solo I'd recommend the solo playlist it's made Comp way more accessible.

Step 3.) Double and Multi kill Medals. This is the confusing part. The quest says defeat guardians and earn medals, double kills grant more progress. This is a lie. Guardian kills don't matter at all. What it's asking for is double and multi kill medals, and weapon specifc medals like Cold Fusion. I did Cold Fusion medals since it required 2 fusion rifle kills in 1 life. For reference, when I first started I had roughly %30 progress and finished with 46 cold fusion medals. I almost never used fusions in crucible so I'd say I had less then 5 total beforehand. If I had to estimate I'd say it's %1.5-2 per medal.

Hopefully this clears up some confusion, and makes the quest seem more feasible to some. It's not as daunting of a grind as it seems the quest description is just misleading.The difference in taming on the Center and Ragnarok compared to the other maps is Night and Day. I can spend a week hunting a high level Giga on the Island without ever seeing anything above level 90, or spend 2-3 days doing the same on the Center and find 1 or 2 depending on luck. I think it's time you consider removing the level bias and giving all levels an equal chance to spawn so official maps are competitive with the mod maps when it comes to mob levels."

-goodguygeorge,4,2,"I grew up with 2 sisters, a mother and a father. My father was a workaholic, and when he came home he acted like an angry alcoholic, but he didn’t drink much. My dad was hardworking and relatively honest. But he was also a very mean guy. He’d be angry and yell about anything for hours on end. Sometimes it would end up with my sister getting beat, other times he’d take it out on my mother. One time he threatened to drive the car into a river and kill us all. He also told me when I was younger that if I ever ended up homeless on the street he would walk by and wouldn’t help me. 

My fathers been extremely abusive towards me and my sisters for a majority of my life. So even though I learned to be hardworking and smart with my money, I didn’t fucking learn much else from my dad. And the fucking mental strain my childhood took on me, I can barely make a friend. My self esteem is shot from all the years of abuse, and now all I do is work, come home, play call of duty and get smoke some weed to forget about shit. I’m not really hooked on the weed, I just know that when I stop i’ll still be sitting in my apartment doing the same shit. I have very few friends and no real gf to speak of. I’ve honestly had several girls be shocked that i’m single. Im not bragging, it’s more me telling you that i’m adjusted, I mostly know how to talk to women (although half the time im pretty sure i just pull it out of my ass)

Here’s the thing, i look like a well adjusted, 29 year old guy on the outside. I’m 6foot2, i’m in 6 pack type shape, i dreas relatively well, i have a job, my own apartment and i have goals too that im working towards. But on the inside? Im a pretty big mess. But goodguygeorge, why dont you just go out and make some friends and do things you like to do? Then you’ll be happier? See thats the thing, i feel like im fuckin terrible at it. My ability to make friends is about a 3 out of 10 at best. The anxiety i feel when i talk to people, 9/10 most of the time. I hate it man, with a passion. But it doesnt go away. 

I dont want to keep rambling though, so if someone thinks they can help, shoot me a message

🤙The short story is my parents were abusive almost my entire life. After moving out and trying to maintain a relationship from afar, i had to cut them off. They were doing no good for my mental health and they’re just not nice people. 

The problem is, i feel like shit. Not that i made a mistake, but i feel like now that i’ve cut them off, i have no family and all these feelings i have seem to be getting stronger. I felt like if i cut my parents off that i’d start to feel better, but i’m not. Anyone have positive stories about getting better as time goes on?MmhmmI’ve had depression for 10 years now, and you expect me to believe that im gonna get better? Several therapists, several different medications, group therapy, CBT, exposure, even apps that help with mental illness. NONE of it works. Instead i feel as shitty as the day this all started. I don’t have the balls to kill myself so i just go about everyday, trying to be happy, trying to find happiness somewhere, anywhere. But what do i get? Depression and anxiety. Fml man.

Im also half greek, so there’s that.

ANYWAYS, here’s the thing, i’m a 6foot2, take no shit, bearded up guy right. When i have sex with a woman, i’m picking her up and putting her in the position i want, telling her when to cum, etc. etc. You get the gist. I’m an alpha male, i dont say that to brag, it is what it is. 

But for the longest time i’ve had this itch that i can’t scratch. See, its easy to find a woman who wants me to take control and be dominant in bed, thats easy. Whats hard is finding a woman who likes being in control. Whats even harder is finding a woman who likes being control but isnt abusive/financially dominant. See i don’t want you to take my money, cause frankly i dont have a lot anyways. What i want is a woman who knows what SHE wants. A woman who likes exploring her dominant side. A woman who likes being in control in the bedroom, giving orders, things like that. 

I want to switch roles for once. We can go into way more detail when we talk. But im hoping i can find someone on here that wants to do that. Also i wont tolerate any financial domination/abuse/or being a cuckold. Im not into that. I just want a woman to take control for once. Even if that means telling me to fuck her harder or whatever else you can come up with. There has to be a woman out there who can do this, is it you?

YoungScholar89,6,3,"Hey r/bitcoin

I would like to gift some BTC to my newborn niece, since I'm rather paranoid and relative to the average cryptocurrency user not exactly tech-savvy, I prefer to print out a blank paper wallet and then manually write the adresses (generated on a computer that is offline) with a pen. This way I don't have to be paranoid about someone getting hold of old printed files and draining the account or having to install Ubuntu on a purely offline device.

As it is a gift I'd prefer something a little prettier than a blank peice of paper with two codes on it. So do you guys know where to find a paper wallet that looks ""professional"" with blank spaces to fill in the adresses (QR codes aren't needed).

I've tried googling but without much succes, the closest I've gotten was [THIS](https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsafepaperwallet.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F05%2Fcropped-BITCOIN-NOTE-cmyk_20-colors.jpg&t=542&c=v2-TY-ARRv03Vg) - but that is only one side of the paper and has only one obvious place to put an address.

I'm hoping this exists and if not I'm kind of surprised and think it would be a nice addition that could ease the minds of new not-so-technical potential BTC users.

Thanks in advanced for any answers!Hey fellow shibes,

I recently invested in $1200 worth of mining equipment to start a small mining venture, however things aren't exactly starting out well. After 3 days of error messages when I finally got Ubuntu up and running on my USB I was not exactly thrilled about the khash my new rig was getting.

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/E26dv8v.jpg) Here is a photo of my setup, I know it's really ghetto but I planned on starting out small and then building a nicer rig/getting risers if I was somewhat succesful. 

**Motherboard** ASUS M5A97 LE - Rev 2.0

**CPU** AMD Sempron 145

**GPU's** 2x Asus R9 280X

**RAM** 4GB DDR3

**PSU** Corsair RM850

Skandisk 16GB USB flash drive


I have installed the latest AMD Beta drivers for Linux and cgminer 3.7.2. I also tried different configurations, inspired by googling my GPU spending a bit of time understanding the different commands and optimizing.

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CRZzpZX) Here are the khash I'm getting, as you can see one card is running hotter with much higher fan RPM and lower intensity. The obvious explanation is that my cards are a bit too close to each other and that the card with the worst airflow to the intake fans was suffering. However, it seemed to me it was the ""outer card"" (the one with good airflow) that was running with fans ~80%. Weird I thought and tried swapping the cards to see if this was really the case. And indeed it was, after swapping the two cards the ""hot"" card was now only able to pull 10-11 in intensity while (100-250'ish khash) with fans going HAM and temps ~75-80c.

Now as the title asks I'm wondering if I received a faulty GPU, I know even identical GPU models not always perform the same but this difference seems WAY to big to be justifiable as ""bad card RNG"". 

Am I missing something?

I'm new to mining and this is my first complete PC I've assembled myself, luckily the store I bought it from has a physical location not too far away, should I call them up or would this go through Asus? What would I say? ""I benchmarked the cards and one a lot worse than it should be"" or just mention mining/my khash? (not sure if that's kinda looked upon as GPU abuse by the retailers and should be kept *hush hush*)

This is really stressing me out with block halving and everything I wanted to get set up and going ASAP but now I can't even justify running the second card paying ~$0.25 pr. kWh. Any and all advice, help and upvotes are very much so appriciated as this shibe feels like he's in a bit over his head.


**EDIT:** thanks a lot for all the responses guys, I took a nap after not getting any responses on this for like an hour so I apologize for the delayed responses. Really blown away by the amount of posts and upvotes, you guys are awesome! I only managed to get 8 hours of sleep the over the last two nights due wanting to get the rig running well, but now I feel well rested and ready to face my hardware demons ;) 

First order of business is trying to run the ""bad"" card alone and see if it still performs horribly.

**EDIT 2:**

The second card did indeed still perform really bad, I even tried swapping PSU cables as someone suggested. Under the exact same config that the other card had been sitting around 72-75c @ 1500 fan RPM (like 40%) this one soared to 88-90c @ 3000 RPM (80% and what I set as max in my config) - and this was before I stopped it, it seemed to be still going up in temps.

**EDIT 3:**

It definately looks like the one GPU is faulty/damaged and I will try to return it for a refund tomorrow. Sadly my other GPU seems to be ~100 khash lower than the avg. after trying some different settings it seems most people get the best result out of the same card (thread-concurrency 8921, gpu-engine 1050-1080 and ~1500 gpu-memclock).

I will try installing BAMT 1.3 to a USB flash drive and see if that somehow improves the hashrates of the ""good"" card.Following the scaling debate, I've seen this: https://cashvscore.com/ link being posted as proof of how superior BCH is to BTC, almost every time fees are being discussed.

The tx fee was consistently sitting at $0.003/kB for BCH.

I (along with others) was a bit suspicious of this number. I get that BCH should be cheaper with all the unused capacity in each block but even then, $0.003/kB seemed low. My suspicion of something being off was increased by the fee fixed to $0.003 (each time I checked over the last week or so).
Looking at https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks also didn't alleviate my suspicion as the tx fees displayed there on recent BCH blocks is a lot higher.

Digging further, on the sites info page I found the following:

>Fees are estimated based on recent blocks, or 0.0001 Bitcoins if the estimate can't be calculated/fetched.

This would explain a constant fee of $0.03 if no estimate could be fetched for whatever reason, whenever the BCH price was in the $250-349.99 range (assuming rounding to 2 decimals). I'm thinking they might've accidently left out a ""0"" in the amount of coins their fee would be if no data could be fetched (assuming rounding to 3 decimals), at least this would explain the constant $0.003.

Displaying **any** fee as a default when you can't get actual data is in my opinion highly misleading, just like you shouldn't display some random price if price data for some reason became unavailable. If anyone know they guy behind it, perhaps he can clarify on some of these choices, I’d also like to hear what “recent fees” entails (avg. of X blocks, X amount of time or X amount of tx in MB). He/she seems to be legitimately trying to have an unbiased site (even owns the corevscash.com link so you can choose which is displayed first xD).

So, was this link wrong this entire time or am I missing something?


**EDIT: I got in touch with the guy running the site and he confirmed that it had been off after working initially, here is his message if anyone cares:**

>Previously the fees for Bitcoin Cash were estimated using the full node software. That did provide some good fee estimation at some point after the fork, but for a while now it has been basically useless.

>It has now been replaced with the fee estimations from BlockTrail. Fees for Bitcoin Core are still provided by estimatefee.com as that seems more established.
Hey fellow shibes! 


I'm contemplating setting up a mining rig for Doge and general scrypt coin mining and would love some feedback. I'm planning on starting out with 2 GPU's with the ability to later add a 3rd/4th if I ever see a decent return on the initial investment.

First of I have to mention that I'm from Denmark so my HW prices might not be comparable to the current ones in the US. What I'm hoping to get out of this thread is some feedback on the different components I've chosen and help with deciding some of them.

**CPU**
AMD Sempron 145 @ **$41** 

I've seen this recommended in many mining rig guides and haven't really looked into it further, so if something new/cheaper has come up - I'd love to hear about it.

**Motherboard**
Asus M5A97 LE - Rev 2.0 @ **$98** 

Again, I've seen this in mining guides - I really don't know a lot about motherboards in general but I understand this should have 4 PCI slots and as such be able to run 4x R9 280X's - with GPU risers of course.

**RAM**
2GB DDR3 Kingston Value RAM @ **$28** 

As I understand it, this is all I need to run Ubuntu, so no reason to overkill here

**HD**
ICIDU Swivel Flash Drive 4GB @ **$12** 

Again this should be good enough to run Ubuntu and CG/SG miner, right?

**PSU**
Cooler Master V series V1000 @ **$264** 

Ouch, good PSU's are super expensive in Denmark atm, I'm having a hard time figuring out if this would be enough to run 3 R9 280X's should I choose to upgrade - if not I will probably go for a Corsair RM850 @ **$194** or a Cooler Master VS series V750 S @ **$159** - but again not sure the last one could even run the two initial GPU's I plan on getting. I feel like it is near impossible to figure out what PSU sizes would be sufficient as most are when calculating for a gamer setup which as I understand it should require more W at it's peak. Also I could look in to undervolting, but that really scares me especially on Ubuntu.

**GPU**
Gigabyte GV-R928XOC-3GD @ **$367**

After a lot price and efficiency comparisons I am fairly certain these are my best bet as far as GPU's go - I'd rather have gone with HDD 7950's but since they retail for the same price here atm that seems like a bad choice.

I plan on not getting GPU risers for the first two cards and just putting one in the bottom and one in the top slot to begin with. And Mount it all in some open ""case"" thingy that I will construct myself. Then if I ever decide to purchase more GPU's I will look into using GPU risers.

I have to admit (might be obvious from the post) that this will be my first PC build from the scrap, although I have looked into it a year or so ago when I almost did my own build. But yea, what I hope is ending up with a fun and fullfilling project that hopefully will pay for 50% of the retail prices within 4-6 months (that would at least give me the ability to bail on it without a net loss if I sold the hardware used), anything more than that would just be an awesome bonus!

Depending on PSU choice this rig would cost me **$1071-$1177**, and at ~1450 KH/s, an expensive $0.3 price pr. KW/h, an avg. watt usage of 600 and the current Doge coin diff/price/block rewards - it would only take ~62 days to achieve 100% ROI - Doge will most likely become less profitable to mine tho' but I would honestly be happy with just 50% ROI in ~120 days, which seems like a very reasonable goal, right?


Thanks in advanced for all responses, this community is just great - I have been hooked since I found this fellowship of shibes and learned how to mine 6 days ago ;)

Sorry it's so damn long, wanted to try to get all my questions/worries in there!"

Tyler_Zoro,10,10,"Clocking in at a final **293 pages** just in the main adventure path itself, not counting the many side books that it took to get here, **DTtD! is finally complete**!

You can find everything through the AP's web page here: https://sites.google.com/view/tylers-adventures/adventure-paths/down-through-the-darklands-adventure-path

## Loose Ends

There is one small bit that is not complete, and probably never will be: >!Just before the final battle there is a keep run by a dhampir sorcerer in the employ of the big bad. It's outlined and the penultimate boss therein is statted, but I just don't have time to finish that one off (work calls). It's really optional. If the PCs found the keep empty except for the dhampir, it would work just as well, but it would leave the final chapter pretty short.!<

## Stopping in Chapter 3

I've also included an escape hatch in the story, should you wish to run it as a 3-chapter AP (like some of Paizo's recent entries). If you do, the AP can end with a slightly modified battle and not really lose anything in the main story. Chapter 4 is really just a denouement intended to give the PCs a suitably epic send-off to either end the campaign or tee up future stories.

## 5e conversion is only semi-ongoing

I've mostly stopped the 5e conversion. I'm using it myself for a group of friends, since they wanted to play 5e, but it won't be polished up any more than it is for 5e GMs other than myself. That said, it's a great starting point if you want to use it to do your own conversion. Just be careful of the power levels of some of the creatures. In Chapter 2, I've mostly corrected for my early misunderstanding of 5e encounter power levels, but some creatures are horrifically over-tuned.

## Going Forward

Down Through the Darklands! was an unexpected project. I just started writing it one day and it took on a life of its own. I'm thrilled with the result, but also glad to be done.

You can look forward to my next project: [Pathfinder: The Masquerade](https://sites.google.com/view/tylers-adventures/settings/pathfinder-the-masquerade), which has a first draft of the main book and a couple early draft side-books so far. I doubt that there will be an adventure path in it, but I might write up a sample short adventure as part of the source books.There is no one definition of God, but I think there is a single trope that all definitions of God tend to conform to, and that is the concept of absolute greatness.

## What we can agree on

This debate is about a definitional approach to God. We might not agree on whether this entity that we are defining exists, or on what specifics might be attached to it. That's not really relevant to this debate. The only issue at hand is whether or not we agree on what does and does not fit into the bucket that we're labeling ""God"".

## Primitive views

In ancient religions, and even the ancient roots of many modern religions, the idea of God was of natural forces taken to their absolute limits. Zeus was the embodiment of the most powerful force of nature that humans regularly observed (lightning) but he was not merely the lighting, he was a being capable of hurling it at will.

The Egyptians viewed the sun (Ra) as the most powerful natural force, and saw God (Amun-Ra) as the being that embodied it but also exceeded the natural power that we could perceive in the sun.

Early Vedics saw in the many gods, whose power was the embodiment of some natural force, a manifestation of a more fundamental expression of transcendent power that, while not as specifically enpersoned as Western notions of God, was still the ultimate entity.

## Western philosophical views

The common thread of all Western philosophy of God is again one of greatness, but greatness takes on a more specific and rigorous definition in philosophy. It is the relationship between two entities where the greater entity contains the lesser or contains the potential for the lesser.

In other words, the Milky Way Galaxy is greater than the Large Magellanic Cloud because there is nothing about the latter that is not embodied in the former (e.g. in terms of mass, number of stars, size, etc.), and therefore we could construct the LMC out of the Milky Way or the Milky Way could give rise to the LMC through some simple transformation or interaction with itself.

This concept of greatness can also be applied to abstracts, but it is often not as intuitively obvious. For example, political theory is not strictly greater than logic, even though logic is, in some sense, a part of political theory. This is because there are abstracts that logic gives rise to (e.g. mathematics) which political theory cannot give rise to on its own. In this sense, logic is more fundamental than, but not strictly greater than political theory or mathematics because those topics involve other attributes not communicated by logic itself.

When Western philosophers, therefore, say that God is, ""that than which nothing greater can be conceived,"" it is not a suggestion that God is very large or that God is the smartest being or that God is nicer than anyone. It is the suggestion that all of these attributes have as a common source one entity which can give rise to any of them, independently, without having to incorporate attributes of some additional entity.

## Lesser forms of God

This concept of God (with a capital G, denoting a personal title or indicator of a singular individual) is incompatible with some religious dogmas about individuals known as God. For example, in the Torah (first five books of the Old Testament, to Christians), God is often seen as a very powerful actor among human events. He appears to Moses and teaches; he appears to Satan and argues; he appears to Adam and condemns. These actions are contingent behaviors, not merely contingent upon the absolute itself, but on time and physical being. They are therefore incapable of existing within this notion of the greatest entity.

Within Jewish theology, this is understood as the interaction between that absolute notion of God and the perception of God through the contingent world. It is therefore not, strictly speaking, God that Satan argued with over Job, but the impression of God upon the world. It is not, strictly speaking, God that conveyed the Torah to Moses, but the closest interaction that a contingent being such as Moses could have with the absolute.

Jewish mysticism, AKA Kabbalah, outlines a nested set of layers through which we perceive this ultimate entity. We perceive the root of the tree of emanation (in other words, the source of our existence) as the place that God exists (Keter, כתר‬) but within (or perhaps ""above"") this is the ever-increasing layers of abstraction are the more fundamental expressions of divinity, ultimately not resembling the notion of God that one might be familiar with in Jewish religious practice at all.

## What does this leave us with?

A much maligned and misunderstood turn of phrase in our modern world, the Takbīr (تَكْبِير), ""Allahu Akbar"" (الله أكبر) meaning ""God is great,"" is often interpreted by Muslims and non-Muslims alike as an exclusionary caim: the God of Islam is greater than the God of any other religion.

I would suggest that this should be interpreted in a different way, and probably gets more to the heart of the matter: God is greatness. No matter the religious dogma that is your lens, what you are referring to when you say, ""God,"" is that than which nothing greater can be conceived.

Is this syncretism? Perhaps. But it is the one definition that I think every religion can agree applies to their conception of God, if they have one, and even applies to some non-theistic religions who would not use the word ""God"" but have a conception of an entity that is greatness.

In modern Hinduism, there are even orthodoxies which assert this entity, but are explicitly atheistic in nature.

## My Views

I think I've made my views clear, but to be specific: God is term to which we attach far too much extraneous detail. Dogma and form are importantly not the same. The claims we attach to God are not the form of the divine, and the form of the divine is greatness.
Magic is one of those words that I put into the ""almost entirely meaningless"" bucket with, ""natural,"" ""supernatural,"" and ""soul"". These terms only have meaning with respect to specific tradition or practice. When contextualized, it certainly can have meaning, but only then.

However, magic is also a common feature of nearly every religion on Earth. From ceremonial magic such as the Transubstantiation of bread and wine in Catholic services, to the calling down of the divine common in Neopagan and other (often polytheistic) religions, to individually mediated acts of power such as those in the Voodoo tradition where such magic is partially personal and partially divine.

Thus, I think we need to come to grips with some sort of understanding of what magic is and what we think we're talking about when we use the word in a religious context.

To this end, I'd like to suggest the following terms as laid out in this diagram: [intersection of magic and religion](https://i.imgur.com/mQHUDaZ.png).

* ***Religion*** - A sacred canopy containing one or more of ritual, tradition, culture, observance, dogma and/or belief. *e.g. Christianity* (see also: [What is Religion?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5KHDR8jdbA)
* ***Magic*** - The intersection of will and action, contextualized through some sublime relationship. *e.g. The Force*
* ***Ritual*** - Any traditional activity, repeated with precise formulation. *e.g. Catholic Mass*
* ***Prayer*** - A mental or verbal communication with some greater power. Typically a form of supplication, and religious in nature. *e.g. Muslim salah*
* ***Spell*** - An act meant to produce some effect through the presence and configuration of specific elements potentially including verbal, mental and ceremonial aspects. *e.g. the creation of a protective ward or talisman*

Each of these definitions is quite broad, intersect and overlap, and their boundaries are not well defined. This is the nature of their usage, and cannot be resolved by fiat without losing the ability to refer to the actual cultural and religious notions that these words typically are used to reference.

The problem is that, here in /r/DebateReligion, we tend to become fixated on the idea that there *can be* a fixed and rigidly defined meaning for these terms, and that leads to tremendous confusion.

## My views

I have taken part in many sorts of magical practices, ranging from the ones that most of us are familiar with (e.g. mainstream religious ceremonies such as the Catholic Transubstantiation) to more obscure sorts that most probably have not come into contact with (e.g. an evocation as part of a [Samhain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain) ceremony) to personal, non-religious symbolic spellwork (e.g. protection spells) to personal, religious spellwork (e.g. creating a sacred space).

Each of these is, for me, a symbolic act, not intended to create a literal change in the physical world so much as to re-align my own and others perceptions of that world. Whether these are, in fact, the same thing is then left as an exercise for the astute reader, and not something that the practitioner necessarily need concern themselves with. Indeed, magical work is probably more often performed by those who do not believe that it has the power to affect the world beyond the boundaries of the perceptions of the individual performing the work and those participating in it with them, if any.

So I would argue that magic is not something that we should treat as strange or alien or necessarily representing any non-standard assumptions. It's just a symbolic way of interacting with our own intent.
I have been really liking the idea of [exploration mode in Pathfinder 2e](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=469) and have introduced optional rules to my fellow players in a 5e game to support this style of play (we'll see if the GM wants to use it...) Thought I'd share it here in case others want to use it.

Essentially exploration mode is the in-between state where you're not in initiative-based encounter mode (e.g. combat) but activities are still organized and have mechanics.

Why is this helpful? Well, it obviates a whole lot of back-and-forth about what's going on as you explore a location, and I really like the way they thread it into combat encounters via the initiative system.

In detail:

* Everyone declares a skill or other single-action ability that they are using that cannot have a consumable resource such as spell slots and which is not actively opposed. This is what they are doing during this period. If I say that my character is investigating, then that's what they're doing as the party moves along and the DM might roll several times or ask me to, as appropriate.
* The group then decides where they are going and the like as normal, always keeping in mind their primary activity from above.
* If combat ensues, the skill most related to what they were doing can be rolled for initiative, so if I'm investigating and my investigation is higher than my initiative, then I can use that to represent my intense attention to the hints that a combat encounter is about to begin. Some skills make no sense for initiative (e.g. medicine) so the DM must adjudicate a player's rationale for using a skill for initiative on a case-by-case basis, but this can be an ideal mechanism for injecting some extra detail and color into a combat as it begins!
* At any time, players can change which ability they are using or perform a non-exploration activity, but they can only ever have one ability as their exploration activity at a time.
This represents on-the-move activities, so the results might be more cursory than otherwise. For example, if a character is investigating while moving, they might spot some scrapes on the floor that indicate some sort of swinging or sliding mechanism, but analyzing them further and drawing conclusions might require more time than they have when just walking by.
* Stealth has an important consequence. Using stealth as an exploration activity not only means that you can roll against stealth for initiative but that you begin encounters hidden unless an opponent detects you using passive perception (for which they might have advantage or automatically succeed if there are few or no means to remain unseen, e.g. walking down a brightly lit corridor with no obstructions or alcoves).
* Exploration is more free-form than combat, so there are no ""turns"" per se. You just roleplay movement and discovery as you go with your primary action guiding the flavor of information and perspective that the DM gives you.
* Some skills don't sound very much like exploration, but they can be used to great effect in exploration mode.
  * Persuasion - As you move through a guarded location, you act as if you belong there and convince guards and others to let you pass.
  * Survival - Hiding your party's tracks as they move through natural surroundings might use this skill.
  * Medicine - Although you're on the move, you can still quickly assess the injured on a battlefield, determining who can't wait to be found by the battlefield medics.
  * Insight - While moving through a crowded market you can quickly assess who might not belong there. Is that customer at a fruit stall pretending to browse the wares while watching your party?
* Not all exploration activities are skills. Cantrips, for example, could be used. Examples:
  * prestidigitation can be used to continuously remove the muck from party members while trudging through a swamp.
  * druidcraft could be used to give the party a resplendent appearance as they move through a natural setting, blooming flowers and reviving wilted plants as they pass.
  * (optional) true strike can be used to give advantage on initiative checks for any immediately hostile encounter where the player can open with an attack.
* ***Super optional!*** Ritual spells can be used while on the move and with continuous effect, which conveys only some benefits depending on the spell. Any ritual that requires a material component cannot be used in this way! The effects should always be muted compared to the normal ritual usage because of the lack of ideal conditions and the continuous nature of the effect.
  * Commune with Nature - As you move through a natural setting, you gain insight according to the specific type of information you are seeking (see spell description), but only a sense of what you might learn if you properly used the spell.
  * Detect Magic - A general sense of the presence of magic is detected, but specifics will require stopping and casting the spell over the normal duration.
  * Silence - Complete silence blankets your party's movement, but this effect ends abruptly when entering combat or otherwise taking a different action, though the spell can be re-cast at that point should the player desire.

This is often done in an ad hoc way in many games. The classic ""SOP"" for dungeon delving is a form of this exploration model. All this does is enhance the structure and remove some quibbling over routine activities.

***A couple updates and responses to common comments***

1. ""Why not just play Pathfinder 2e?"" -- Because it's not always that simple. First off, D&D 5e has a lot going for it, and maybe those features are what you decided were most important. Maybe you are just a player in the game, but would like to offer the DM a way to enhance non-combat mechanics. Options are a good thing and no DM has to use a house rule they don't like in their game.
2. Someone pointed out that one of the major advantages is that this system points out options to players. This is a great insight and definitely worth noting.
3. This isn't a combat mechanic (except for its impact on initiative, which DMs should keep under careful control). As such it shouldn't be evaluated in the spirit of combat-mode min/maxing. Encounter mode should be about freeing players up to think about the world and their interaction with it, not adding crunch to RP moments.This posting is about classical conservatism. If you're not familiar with that, it's essentially just a tendency to favor the status quo. That is, it's the tendency to resist progressivism (or any other source of change) until intended and unintended consequences are accounted for.

As an example, a conservative in US during the late 1950s might have opposed desegregation on the grounds that the immediate disruption to social structures would be substantial. But a conservative today isn't advocating for a return to segregation (that's a traditionalist position, which is often conflated with conservatism).

So my question in the title is: does classical conservatism exist in absolute terms? That is, can we say that there is a conservative political position, or is it just a category of political positions that rotate in or out over time?

(*Note: there is also a definition of classical conservatism, esp. in England circa the 18th-19th centuries, that focuses on the rights associated with land ownership. This posting is not addressing that form of classical conservatism.*)TL;DR we already have one abandoned third-party trade assistant that, if history is a guide, will eventually become a source of malware. GGG needs to update trade handling before that happens so we're not relying on installing third-party programs.

## Intro

We've talked quite a lot about trading in this sub... probably so much that most of you have tuned it out, but we've entered a dangerous period in PoE's history, and I think it's important for everyone to think about this topic some more, especially GGG's development and marketing people. Why marketing? We'll get to that...

## Background

So, for those of you who have been suffering in the dark ages, let me tell you why you get those instant responses and thank-you's from so many players these days when trading. There are tools out there like MercuryTrade and [POE-Trades-Companion](https://github.com/lemasato/POE-Trades-Companion) that allow players to click a button and invite, kick, trade, respond, etc. This solves many fundamental limitations of the game. For example, when someone sends me a trade request while I'm in Standard for an item I'm selling in the temp or race league, I can send a request that they wait a minute with one button, then log out, log in to the correct league and invite them, without having to remember or write down their name!

These programs are third-party add-ons that use official features in the game that allow them to read chat messages and send input (but only chat input, so they can't play the game for you).

## The problems

We've always known that having third party programs interact with the game was problematic. It trains the playerbase to trust installing random programs that might contain malicious features such as keylogging or monitoring non-game activity. However, we have now entered the next phase of the problem. MercuryTrade has become stagnant, has many bugs, and is probably abandoned. But players still use it, and it still has a ""check for updates"" button. This means that, at some point, GGG could have to deal with the original author turning it over to someone less reputable who sees being installed on 10s of thousands of player's machines as a payday. They just have to offer a new update that includes whatever they want!

This is only going to get worse over time, and there's nothing stopping a new entrant into the space from offering a from-day-one abusive tool. And no, having it on github where you can look at the source doesn't help, because we don't know that the released install program doesn't contain more than is in the source code.

## The solution

The solution is an always has been that GGG support trading more fully in the game. They can no longer say that semi-automated trading (that is, push-button attended trading with the user present) will damage the experience. That bridge has been crossed, and we're living on the other side today. The only way we could go back is to break the API with no replacement, and that would lead to a pretty severe outcry from users that could damage the game. GGG needs to support the basic features offered by these programs at a bare minimum, and probably go a bit further.

We all get the ""player interaction"" idea, and it was a good one, but it's dead and has been for a very long time. We press a button on poe.trade or the official trade site, we get an invite, go to the hideout, twiddle our thumbs until the trade window is open and then mouse over the item to make sure it's the one that was offered (maybe it is, maybe it isn't and maybe you catch it or don't) and then teleport to your own refuge, safely away from the risk of any genuine interaction.

At BEST, you get to see someone else's hideout.

**GGG needs to think about this interaction, support and improve what's already positive and rip out everything that could damage the game long-term.** This isn't a suggestion, this is a warning.

Of course, all of this has the side benefit of improving the experience for any consoles that PoE might run on now or in the future, though I seem to remember that trading is already a bit different on XBox than it is on PC.

Anyone know some other bars(1, 5, or 10 ozt. preferably) that are thicker than normal.  I have some 1 ozt. and 10 ozt. but I'm not a fan of the shape.  Also are the 10 ozt. the same shape?  It is hard to tell from pictures.

I'm thinking the Geiger Security Line might be right up my ally.

Anyone else still stuck on pre-order for Betrayal at CoolStuffInc?

I've seen other places fill their pre-orders and show stock for about two weeks now, but CSI still seems to be stuck waiting for their shipment.

I emailed them but all they could say is they didn't receive anything else.

I'm getting slightly worried, seeing that cardhaus and others are already OOS of their shipment.  Should have canceled and reordered there while I had the chance.

Anyone else in the same situation or actually get their copy?  I had some other games in the order that we were going to play last weekend and this weekend, but I guess that's a bust.

Also, if anyone can suggest somewhere with similar prices that might still have it in stock, let me know.  I should have switched to cardhaus while I had the chance, but I figured CSI was just behind a week or two.

*edit - Mine was ordered February 28th.I've been running Cage/Iron Fist/OBW.  They're doing alright, but am I missing a better combination?

Besides looking worse than my first solder job, isn't that bridged spot going to cause an issue?  I'm not an expert, but I'm a little concerned.  If so, can it be recovered?  Does anyone see any other issues?

Is this standard quality for repair shops.  They had dozens of TVs there they were supposedly working on.

rsayers,1,10,"This past weekend I went to Quakecon, and for the first time in 10 years, I brought along a computer into the BYOC area.  I brought along a Linux laptop with no Windows partition at all. 

I had considered attempting to install windows to a partition on this machine, but decided not to bother.  Despite this, I really had no issues gaming with everyone else.  I played more Quake Live than anything else (as I do at home as well).  Despite Mac and Linux support being pulled last year, I have been running it in Wine with essentially no problems.  

Beyond that, I played regular Quake 3 Arena (via ioquake3),  Team Fortress 2, Urban Terror, and then some single player games: Euro Truck Simulator 2, and Goat Simulator.

The only time I was left unable to play was when my friends decided to play Nazi Zombies mode in Call of Duty 5.  I was able to launch the game from Wine with no problems and play for a few minutes,  but at some point the game crashed and simply quit on me. 

It was sort of a reminder of how far gaming has come on this platform being able to take a Linux machine to a large PC gaming convention like this.  Just a few years ago I would have not even considered doing this.  We've come a long way!Actually a year + 1 day, yesterday was the official date.  I feel like I've had an easy time with it, only a couple times have I even felt the urge to drink, and that passed pretty quickly.  

Quitting in the first place was far more difficult, just getting to that stage where I knew that enough was enough.  So many drunken nights where I just knew that I had to change something.

This group has been the only real support line I've had, despite never posting here before.  Just reading everything written by you fine people has been more motivation than you could know.

Oh, and I will not drink today!"

That's... something.This might sound like a bullshit complaint, but my tolerance for neighborhood noise is pretty high. I live in the middle of the Quarter and there's a relatively constant din of construction and faint bumping from Bourbon St and parties and brass bands and the calliope and all that... That's the stuff I love. And I love dogs, too... but somewhere behind me there's a dog that gets thrown outside in the morning and basically left there all day and for whole time it is outside it barks. I mean, constantly. like this...

Ruff... Ruuff... RUFRUFRUFRUFRUF....
Ruff... Ruffff... RUFRUFRUFRUFRUF...

It's almost like it's some kind of bark code because it's always the same.

I THINK it's coming from the fancy apartments on the riverside of the 800 block of Dauphine, but I can't really tell. I'm bothered more by the fact that the dog is clearly in distress for most of the day, but also the barking is starting to drive me crazy. Considering all the other things in this city that could drive one crazy, this is saying something.

Anyway... I'm not filing a noise complaint cause I'm not THAT big of a bitch (and I know nothing would come of it)... I'm just hoping that whoever's dog that is will see this message because I want to tell them:

nwydo,5,1,"[failchain](https://github.com/cristicbz/failchain) is a small library which brings back some of the convenience and conciseness of `error_chain` into `failure`. In particular, `chain_err`, `bail!` and `ensure!` with custom `ErrorKind`-s.


It codifies and cuts down on the verbosity required by the ErrorKind pattern from the [failure book](https://boats.gitlab.io/failure/error-errorkind.html), which is roughly used by e.g. *(all hail)* /u/burntsushi 's [imdb-rename](https://github.com/BurntSushi/imdb-rename/blob/master/imdb-index/src/error.rs).


It builds on top of (and is compatible with) the `Fail` trait. Unlike `error_chain` it doesn't support links or default string `ErrorKind`-s. 



It's just a proof of concept, but I've used it successfully to migrate [rust-doom](https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom) off `error_chain` and onto `failure`, when just using plain `failure` turned out to be too verbose. You can see the [final diff](https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom/pull/135/files) for an `error_chain` -> `failchain` migration.


I'd be curious to hear any thoughts ranging from ""this should be included in failure"" all the way to ""I'd rather gouge my eyes out and return i16 error codes"".

Examples: [README](https://github.com/cristicbz/failchain#what-it-looks-like), [simple string](https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom/blob/887d1eac228b202526a3d9769312705e38214ec0/game/src/errors.rs), [multiple string ErrorKind-s](https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom/blob/887d1eac228b202526a3d9769312705e38214ec0/wad/src/errors.rs), [more complex ErrorKind-s](https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom/blob/887d1eac228b202526a3d9769312705e38214ec0/engine/src/errors.rs), [chain_err and ensure!](https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom/blob/887d1eac228b202526a3d9769312705e38214ec0/wad/src/image.rs#L68).

I have some example code here: http://is.gd/9tx1Hw , but the gist is:

        // I'd like to write:
        //     do_something_with_big_by_ref(if can_use_cache() {
        //                                      cache.cached()
        //                                  } else {
        //                                      &bespoke_big(cached_big.clone())
        //                                  });
        //
        // But it doesn't borrowck. Instead I have to write:
        
        let cached_big: &Big = cache.cached();
        let new_big: Big;  // Only initialized if the cached version is not good.
        let big: &Big = if can_use_cache() {
            cached_big
        } else {
            // Store a temporary bespoke Big, and put it on the stack in `new_big`.
            new_big = bespoke_big(cached_big.clone());
            &new_big
        };
        
        do_something_with_big_by_ref(big);

I need to conditionally pass to `do_something_with_big_by_ref` either (a) a reference to a member of `Cache` or (b) a reference to a temporary. I feel that there _is_ a more elegant way of doing this (that doesn't involve a conditionally initialized stack variable), but I can't find it for the life of me. The real code where this comes from is [here](https://github.com/cristicbz/rust-doom/blob/master/src/wad/visitor.rs#L298-L312) in rust-doom.I'm talking about the [filter_map](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.filter_map) and [flat_map](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.flat_map) methods in the [Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) trait.

The signature on `filter_map` is

    fn filter_map<B, F>(self, f: F) -> FilterMap<Self, F> 
        where F: FnMut(Self::Item) -> Option<B>

while `flat_map` has:

    fn flat_map<U, F>(self, f: F) -> FlatMap<Self, U, F> 
        where F: FnMut(Self::Item) -> U, U: IntoIterator

But `Option<B>: IntoIterator<B>` so any function which satisfies `filter_map`'s bounds also satisfies `flat_map`'s bounds, hence `flat_map` seems strictly more general than `filter_map`. See: https://is.gd/UVhUA0

My only idea is that  `filter_map`'s signature may help inference, something like a `fn foo<T: IntoIterator>() -> T`, then `flat_map(foo)` would fail inference. But that seems very weird and I can't come up with any resonable way of producing _any_ `IntoIterator` since it has no static methods...

Am I missing anything obvious? * [Repo](https://github.com/cristicbz/sync-splitter)

If you want to build a tree inside a `Vec` (with index 'pointers') using rayon, I haven't found any way of doing it without unsafe (let me know if there is!). The example in the README probably gives a better idea of the pattern.

So I factored out a little crate for this pattern (which I used in a BVH implementation). All it does is it stores a `*mut T`, a length and a `AtomicUsize` cursor. It implements `Sync` and hands out references tied to `self` rather than the original `slice`.

I'd really appreciate a quick review of the `unsafe` bits, to make sure it's sound! Alternatively I'll also take people telling me there's an existing solution for this instead, of course."

All the best!I think I'm heading into a breakdown of sorts.

Which is weird since I know it is just a job. I have a lot of other things going great. Three months in what I thought was a dream job is turning out to be anything but. 

The first two months were good, progressing with training and getting ready to take on clients. One fine Monday I was abruptly informed that I'm not ready. Weird at first but whatever, I'm a professional and thought this is ""normal"" and a chance to show what I can do.

But the past month has been a deterioration of everything. One step forward, three steps back. The expectation is now to close being an expert. Mismatched hiring, unrealistic expectations, botched training process, mixed from trainers and managers, and just snafus on many levels. 

My exit strategy is to start looking for other jobs while I toughen it out for a few months and move when it is good but I can't anymore.  I'm waking up with weird dreams and bubbling up other insecurities. *I tell myself just a job, it'll be OK, but why does it feel like I'm physically drowning* ?

*Should I give in my notice now?* I've got a couple of interviews lined up but don't expect anything soon. How would it look if there is a gap in employment and be truthful about really searching a better fit?Mid 30s. No kids yet. Work in IT, can, but dont want to work fully remote yet. NOT a developer so not a 6 figure salary yet. Time in life to make the next step in buying a house and laying the foundations for a family but ... got sticker shock. 

I understand what some people here say about COL. I lived in Los Angeles prior, loved the outdoors and culture but price to pay was just so friggin ridiculously high. 

I was going to list my criteria of what's important to me, but as an immigrant to this great country -  it is my prerogative to adjust and fit so I can make the very best of it. I WANT to adjust. 

All I ask are places that have a good mix of jobs availability/growth, nature, and connectivity (airports or transportation hubs). I'm not looking at the lowest cost. The special sauce that I'm hoping for is ... I don't know how to articulate this very well ... a working class ethos and neighborliness? Quality of life stuff. 

For those who have searched and found, or are still searching - can you tell me whats your list? These are mine, and they're just observations. 

1. Atlanta. Not great in any but well rounded in everything. Scores high in connectivity, affordability, above average in growing jobs. Diverse, nice folks and some nature. Kind of becoming the LA of the South I feel. 

2. Denver. Very awesome on nature, good on jobs. Nature types like me want to be here but wondering if its going to be the next Seattle. But, the midwest ethos (or just Colorado) is the pulling factor here.

3. Seattle area. Jobs. Nature. Alaska airlines. Very high cost of living. But the salaries here (and no state income tax) do offset a lot of the burdens. It may be too late now because a stupid house is like 500k. Also, bigfoot. 

4. Texas. No state income tax, lots of land to have live in a castle by myself, great connectivity, great diversity but not sure about neighborliness. Except for Austin, it may almost be depressing in the nature category. 

5. Salt Lake City. Almost moved here. Superb nature. Just OK connectivity. Low-ish cost, but the salaries don't seem to be competitive. Dual track of life here, Mormons, and everyone else (the minority).

6. Charlotte/Raleigh. A *safe* balance of things but honestly nothing to shout about. Something like Atlanta lite with slightly cooler summers. 

7. Chicago/Minneapolis. I have not been here so I apologize if I lumped them together. That said, is this the midwest ethos capital that also fulfills the jobs and nature criteria? 

8. **BONUS**: If I could work remote and didn't want to settle down (maybe like some kinda of super cool uncle) I would consider these places to be strategic. 

8a. Las Vegas: Close to California, 5 National Parks, excellent connectivity (direct international flights) cheap when living off the strip, seriously good asian food, people want to visit you. 

8b. Orlando. No state income tax Florida, really great looking housing that is on the cusp of reasonable affordability. Space coast, Disneyworld means superb connectivity. I think I also saw some hills, if you can call them that.Lets take a moment to see that despite our differences we have common roots. Build on that. 

What other New Year celebrations are there amongst you?Flying in from the Polar vortex area up north for a coupla days. What is unique to do in Tampa water but not beach related? I'm thinking Gulf fishing, freshwater springs (is it really that great?), manatees, sailing at night in between St. Pete/ Tampa? I'm in the camp where you pay for the other party when the relationship has a solid footing, or looks like it will be. Until then, we are on an even keel. It also removes the feeling of being obligated. 

What's your two cents on this?

AboveDisturbing,5,6,"Sweet salty Jesus, of all the things we could have had as a trilogy, we got what we got. Fuck me. Fuck Disney. Fuck.

I know it is a bit of a delayed reaction. If we were meant to relegate the EU to the non canon, I feel like we could have at least had a story that shows Luke some odd years later with his established Jedi order. Ben Solo coulda been the shit, just a former Padawan Learner and now a Jedi Knight alongside his Uncle, Grand Master Skywalker.

Interactions with new characters and a coherent overarching plot (A new Threat to the Galaxy and the Jedi Order! Yuuzhan Vong maybe?) Would have been cool.

We coulda explored the Force and see training. We could even play with some of the material the DT messed with, like Ben struggling with the Dark Side in much the same way his grandfather did, or even LUKE!

Want a string female lead? Make Rey a a goddamn student of Luke with her own shit going on.

Keep Finn in there.

Of for the love of fuck NO MORE EMPIRE VS REBELLION HORSE SHIT. We did that already. New baddie. New antagonists and a different layout of conflict.

So much potential. Wasted. Leia and Han could have played a bigger better role, be in love still and everything it whatever, there could have been so much epic fucking greatness.

I wasnt asking for Luke to be Mr Indestructable Badass, I was looking for him to be the Obi Wan passing down the mantle, to be formidable in his force powers, to still be able to hold his own and then some alongside new additions and old friends.

And we got this bullshit. Fuck.

spartan116chris,3,3,"As the title states I'm a Souls vet that has been playing since Demons Souls. I put Bloodborne down after getting to Cainhurst castle about 6 months ago and just picked it back up after getting stuck on my Dark Souls onebro attempt. I love this game, especially the setting and atmoshphere, and I was excited to pick it back and crush it after gaining even more skill from my SL1 attempt. 

Well things weren't going very well. I was having a hard time with even trash mobs and Martyr Logarius took me 5 or 6 attempts and took a good 30 mins even though I have a +10 saw cleaver. Then I discovered the dlc and went ahead with that but it was brutal. My attacks were doing nothing to the npc hunters and they had SO much health. I could only make it to the first shortcut by running past the hunters to open the gate. After that I was just in disbelief. How could I be having such a hard time? I remember it had gotten tough when I put it down but I'm great at Souls games. So I went back to the Hunters Dream to examine my build and check out my gems. And then I saw it as I stared at the workshop options. ""Fortify weapon"", ""add bloodgem"",...""repair weapons"". 

I clicked the ""repair weapons"" option just to see how my weapons were doing. And I stared at the screen for a good 30 seconds and just face palmed so hard. Apparently my saw cleaver must have broke during the play session when I put the game down and I must have been in an intense fight and just never noticed. I'm an idiot lol. 

TLDR: picked up bloodborne again, shit seemed way harder than I thought it would, went through Cainhurst and up to Ludwig with a broken weapon until I noticed and realized what a beautiful idiot I am.[https://imgur.com/a/3d0n7Rg](https://imgur.com/a/3d0n7Rg)

With only a couple of weeks left in the season I figured now was the time to stop procrastinating and wrap up loose ends. Set out to get all Savathuns Eyes and didnt wanna LFG to get the Dungeon eyes so I just loaded in solo just to see how many I could get myself, thinking I wasn't near Esoterikk skill at this game to actually do it flawlessly. I ended up getting them all and realized ""I can do this"". My first real attempt I managed to get to the Cube room, the next attempt I got all the way to the boss. Once that happened I figured since I don't have to work until tomorrow night I'll just stay up all night and get this done. 

After my early success my hubris slapped me in the face and I spent a few hours dying to stupid mistakes, took a nap, came back determined to keep going and after a couple close runs where I kept dying with 25% health left on the boss because I kept falling behind too far-I finally got the DPS down while remembering to keep up with the boss. As the final ticks of Anarchy finished him off I fist pumped so hard and quietly celebrated so I didn't wake up anybody! This accomplishment is right up there with Rivensbane, my one Flawless Trials run, week 1 Crown of Sorrow completion, but probably my favorite because it was just me, my skill, my determination, and my knowledge of the game that carried me through.

SL1, All bosses, No DLC, no summons

Been playing Souls games since the beginning when Demons Souls released in the west and immediately fell in love with the style of game From Soft created, and Dark Souls most of all stuck with me. I've beaten the game many times, picked it back up just to try out a fun new build in that fantastic world many more times than that. When SL1 runs started becoming a thing I marveled at the people who attempted that kind of challenge but I never felt the need to try it myself until recently when I started feeling pretty bored with games in general. I figured it might pull me out of the rut with a real challenge and I know the game pretty much like the back of my hand so after several play sessions I've finally achieved my ultimate goal and it really does feel special to know I'm THAT good at these games I love so much. 

Ornstein and Smough were definitely the toughest challenge and that was the only point I used any Pyro during a boss fight, besides them the only point of the run I even broke a sweat on was the 4 kings. Thanks for the support and advice from the people following along especially u/Ridiculisk1 for the fantastic SL1 roadmap. Nice to join your ranks my fellow Onebros.[removed]Title http://imgur.com/a/WOphZ

Doing my first SL1 run to join the ranks of the onebros and I started with my personal fave and choice for the series best with the OG Dark Souls. Waltzed into Anor Londo, I've played plenty of Dark Souls, but man O&S were the wall they have been billed as at SL1. I'd say it took me 30-40 attempts though I didn't keep track. Now the rest of the game should be cake and I look forward to finally completing my goal of joining the ranks of the onebros soon.

Update!: 

I finally cleared the 4 kings. I picked it back up last night to try a few attempts, I've been playing Bloodborne to ease the stress of all the failed 4 kings attempts. Maybe the increased dodging or fast paced combat tuned my senses a bit more or maybe I just needed to destress for a bit but sure enough on my 3rd attempt I got the magic run as I easily dodged around most every attack they threw, only had to put up with 1 magic attack though I had to be ballsy and go for the kill on 2 of them as they charged up a magic pulse, and just crushed them with relentless strong attacks. 

It felt so good to kill them so easily after they frustrated me for the last couple of weeks, and didn't even have to use any Pyro. It would have been even easier if I went to kill the Stray Demon to max out my Lighting axe but the guy who write the sl1 road map made it seem like he was super tough and should be handled later. After the 4 kings I went on a tear and downed Nito, Stray Demon, Firesage, and the Bed of Chaos. Now I'm trying to learn the Dukes Archives skip but it's not going very well haha so next time I might just take the long way to kill Seath and finally stand before Gwyn!

http://m.imgur.com/7FUfDHQHey guys I'm 28 and planning my first trip to Pattaya and wanted to do a bit of research. I've been to the Philippines and it was awesome but also kind of a disaster in multiple ways and I didn't do as much research as I should have. I probably ended up overpaying that trip by about $500-$1000 US. I don't want to set a super strict budget so I can just focus on having fun but spending reasonably still. So in regards to that I'd like to ask a few questions.

Airfare is what it is, I'm assuming I'll be paying around $1500. Accommodation seems like I can expect to spend around $300 for a decent hotel or $400 for a nicer condo. Food and drink don't matter much I usually just drink alot of water and I'll eat Thai when I'm hungry. Transportation would probably just be the taxi there and back to the airport so shouldn't be more than $150. So adding up all the essentials should put me a bit over $2k on the generous side but hopefully I can manage less. 

One thing though, coming from US most of the arrivals are very late night/early morning local time so are there private taxis that will pick me up at that late hour and take me to Pattaya or will I need to stay in Bangkok for a few hours? And are there any decent hotels that will check me in for the morning until I can check into my actual place later in the day?

Now entertainment wise I could use some help. What is a reasonable price for long time currently? I've read articles and the prices they give vary from 1500THB to upwards of 6k. I realize this also varies because some guys are more than willing to bang an average looking girl and besides that the definition of hot or average depends on personal preference, but generally speaking how much should I be offering an above average to hot gogo to bang for the night and not be getting ripped off, 5k seems pretty pricey but maybe prices have just raised that much?

Another thing is why does every article and numerous redditors always use the line ""remember, you don't pay for sex you pay them to fuck off""? Is this like an inside joke or something first timers just don't realize about bar girls? 

Cash wise what is the best and safest way to go about getting your cash for fun times? In the Philippines ATMs seemed to work just fine but I was never taking out multiple thousands every night like I will be in Pattaya. Is there a better way to handle getting cash and how should I go about keeping it so as not to get robbed if people see me taking out stacks. 

Lastly a couple things. Are male enhancers easy to come by? Do you need a prescription for Viagra or can I just walk into a pharmacy and get it? Also I've heard of some kind of erection gel that's sprung up recently and it's supposed to actually work quite well, or is that just another voodoo hoodoo male enhancer snake oil thing? 

Are girls in Pattaya really quite clean? There's conflicting stuff about how they're either some of the cleanest red light districts in the world because they're tested weekly and what not or else pure horror stories about guys catching HIV and all manner of nasty STDs over there. I'm really tempted to bareback a girl there but then my brain turns back on and tells me I better dam well use a condom every single time. 

Thanks and any additional info you guys have that you think i should know would be much appreciated."

TickleMyWeasel,8,3,"http://i.imgur.com/7ENDTHc.jpg Boas, r/portugal! Em Novembro comecei a fazer exercícios de escrita para me preparar para escrever um livro (como já falei previamente neste sub), e criei um exercício que me trouxe muita satisfação. Queria saber a vossa opinião sobre o exercício e se acham que poderá ser útil para me ""aquecer a escrita"".

 O exercício consiste em ver qual a palavra do dia no site do Priberam, e depois escrever o que me vier à cabeça em relação a essa palavra. Vou usar a minha primeira tentativa como exemplo:

""Cinefilia - ""Forte interesse ou entusiasmo pelo cinema.""

  Ela afundou-se pesadamente na cadeira de veludo encarnada e deixou escapar um suspiro, igualmente pesado. Foi forçada a sentir-se envergonhada pelo seu alheio vizinho do lado, que lhe lançou um esgar de aviso. 
  Apesar de ter uma sala inteira literalmente disponível, o jovem rapaz sentara-se ao lado da única outra pessoa que lá estava presente. Ao início, ela pensou que ele o tinha feito para meter conversa (o que a irritou profundamente), mas aquela atitude mostrara exatamente o contrário. Isso trouxe-lhe alívio. Só queria assistir ao filme, tranquilamente, absorver a experiência e todos os detalhes, observar todos os planos e analisar todas as falas. Não tinha em mente iniciar conversa mesquinha com um desconhecido. E ele tinha a mesma intenção que ela quando entrou naquela sala. Assim que os anúncios acabaram, focou-se intensamente no ecrã. Durante todo o filme, os seus olhos claros não mudaram de trajetória. Saltavam, de detalhe em detalhe. E ela questionava-se, virada para a frente, a olhar mas não a ver, quando é que ele iria meter conversa. Quando o filme acabou, as luzes acenderam-se gradualmente. Ele lançou as mãos aos olhos e, com as pontas dos dedos, esfregou-os violentamente. Levantou-se lentamente, lançou à rapariga um olhar ameno, com os olhos um pouco fechados por um sorriso caloroso e, com um tom de voz extremamente amigável, perguntou:
 -Gostaste? 
Com confusão estampada no seu rosto, ficou em silêncio antes de lançar um patético ""sim"" para o ar. 
 Ele alargou o sorriso caloroso do início da conversa e seguiu para a saída, de mãos nos bolsos. Ela seguiu-o com os olhos até ele desaparecer entre as pretas portas grossas de madeira. Voltou-se para a frente e tentou pensar no filme que acabara de ver. 
 Afundou-se pesadamente na cadeira de veludo encarnada e deixou escapar um suspiro, igualmente pesado.""

Depois de alguns dias seguidos a fazer isto, torna-se bastante interessante ver os resultados e é bom analisar os desafios que algumas palavras trazem. Quero saber o que acham disto (e já agora algum feedback no texto). 
 
Cinema é uma paixão enorme que tenho e que adorava seguir, mas tenho receio do futuro e do que me pode esperar depois do curso. Opiniões? "

Space0range,6,8,"I'm a junior, 16 years old, and I want to start playing baseball. I played when I was younger but it has been a long time since i last played. I've been swimming for the past 5 years and am on my varsity team at school. However due to exercise induced asthma which gets especially bad in the pool due to the chlorine fumes, hot air, and constant breath holding, I struggle a lot throughout practices and can only compete in very fast sprints. I really can't take 2 hour practices where I struggle to breath anymore, and want to switch sports. I've always loved baseball and it doesnt trigger my asthma as I'm outside and its short bursts of energy. I know I'm not good enough for my school team anymore but are there any outside of school leagues that deal with novice players 16 years old? I know most kids my age have been playing for many years and are very good, but I'm only 16, is there any way to get into the sport still, a weekend novice league or something? With swim you can still start at 16, you can just join a swim club and they'll teach you and train you from the ground up. Anything like this for baseball? I'm located in the orange county area, in LA. Thanks.Hey guys, I started learning to program probably 3 months ago on the website codecadamy, and I started with python. I've gotten a bit far into it, but I've been wondering if it was best to start with if I am mainly looking to create small flash games first. I've been reading that most of these games are made with javascript, so should I switch over and start learning javascript, or does Python have these same capabilities to create games?Hey guys, I've been having a lot of trouble progressing my bench press, and was wondering if I'm doing something wrong with my routine or something. I'm 17, 5'8, 140lb normally get in the gym 5 days a week, and swim for my school's swim team every other day, so I'm pretty active. I normally do an alternating bro split, chest and tri's one day, back biceps the other, with legs and abs worked in there.

Chest day I normally start with bench press. My routine is normally
5x10reps 95lb
5x6reps 115lb
4x3reps 125lb
1x2reps 135lb

135 seems to be my max and I need a spotter for it, but I've been stuck here for a while, even though I've physically gotten a little bigger and can lift more with other lifts, I'm disappointed with my progression with benching, I've been going consistently to the gym for maybe 9 months now. 
I'm wondering, is there something wrong with the routine I'm doing that may be holding me back, should I be doing something differently?

I was wondering if there was anything I could do to help improve my articulation. Often in my raps if i get to a pretty fast part or one with several difficult syllables for me, it'll almost start slurring, or not slur but just get difficult to separate the words clearly when listening, so it can be hard to pick up on puns or stuff hidden in the lyrics. I also have a problem where my mouth gets dry pretty fast, and at the beginning of some raps when I first open my mouth, it'll still be dry and make some of those, mouth noises I guess? I hope that makes sense. I'm just wondering if there's any tips to help with this, or any tricks that you guys have found to help with articulation and better vocals.Hi all looking to begin a structured training program. If anyone has a trial code I would appreciate it! ThanksHi, I've never smoked, I was offered once or twice by friends, but i used to be afraid of it, always thought they were like cigarettes. Anyways, I want to try, and know a guy at school that sells. I was wondering if an edible might be better though because I wouldn't have to worry with knowing how to wrap it, get a lighter, and find a place to smoke it. Thanks! Im the guy, and I've been on 3-4 dates before and know the basics. Smile, confidence but dont be a dick, polite, all that. But this girl doesn't go to my school, we've sort of been set up by a mutual friend, and although we texted for a few hours the other night I dont know her super well. All the other girls I've gone out with I knew from school and was super comfortable with. We're going minigolfing then ice cream or dinner. I guess I'm just nervous and was wondering if anyone had any advice or anything. Thanks! Sorry for the wall of text.
Ok, so I'm going to be a junior in high school next year, been on adderall for 2 years, and another ADD med before that. I suffer from all the main symptoms when i take my meds. Dry mouth, low appetite, feeling weak and tired, swim practice after school can often be hell with very little food in me + not full nights sleep as adderall can keep me up with constant thoughts sometimes. I also have a lot of trouble being fun and just enjoying life, being with friends, and simply having fun. There was that old youtube video, taylor swift and goat, and my friends would all love it. But I entirely lack a personality on adderall, and i would just look at them like they're idiots for it. However, straight A's.

I basically feel like adderall takes over my life. I've thought about this a lot, and idk what to do. On one hand I'm just not myself with the medicine. Without it, I'm this fun, happy dude with a million jokes, really outgoing. Adderall turns it all off mostly. But without it, it would be back to D's and F's. One thing I try to do is not take the medicine when I can, maybe friday if I don't have any tests, and always on the weekends, just to be myself again. But its not ok during weeks of school when I am just out of it, and I hate that adderall makes me this way. Im always jealous of my friends who can pull the A's and still be fun.

I guess I'm just wondering if theres any of you guys out there who are in the same place, and have found any solutions, or alternate add drugs with less severe symptoms or anything. I really dont want to go through another year of this, feeling alone, annoyed all the time, and just unable to be myself. People notice when i dont take my meds, they'll say, wow Space0range you seem really happy today and stuff like that,and thats where i always want to be, but I cant because no meds = no grades. I guess this sort of turned into a rant, I'm just tired of feeling this way. This summer has been great without Adderall, and I'm not looking forward to going back.

(sorry for all the spelling mistakes.)
TL:DR - I don't like the zombie adderall turns me into, are there any alternatives or solutions, anyone in the same boat?"

D1STURBED36,8,7,"4 games today. first was a shitty stompfest that was easily won. next 3 were complete shit, either everyone dc's at 10min or retard stacks..I love her - but ive found she just doesnt work. Recently inspired by [the only way to play: medusa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynT3RcmGOLE) i decided to give her another shot. I used to play her when i was a lot more new and had a surprisingly high win rate... somehow. Anyway, ive been doing aquilla, treads, mask into skadi and usually daedulus, sometimes getting a casual demon edge before the skadi. Ive also tried phase boots (not as good as treads IMO, the extra damage does not help at all compared to tread switching/stats) but i just cant get her to pump out any damage or make a good impact, it feels the games i win i would of won anyway, and the loses might of been avoided by picking someone that actually does damage lol.

i had a nice win streak, but on the 2nd loss its painfully obvious the flaws of picking her - at least in a pub.

example: last game before i decided im stopping playing her was me vs antimage, both had free farm - anti mage came online at about 20-30 minutes after BF and manta and was disgusting in teamfights while i... slowed them. sure, the nuke was nice but nothing compared to AM.

then look at spectre, which does the same thing but better - and can join fights instantly from farming.

it just feels she needs to much, including a rapier, compared to anyone else. i really dont want to get a rapier in a game that we arnt wanting to close out with a rosh (+ the rapier), and by then your winning anyway - so whats the point of medusa? not only do you desperately want damage, but you want mana (and regen), hp... and everything really.


Maybe its time to look at what the newest patches have to offer her and rethink her play style? the MoM synergy is nice, but skadi right after might be the wrong way to go - sure, it gives a huge boost to all your attributes, but your still not contributing much. maybe another cheaper stat item to hold her survivability up followed by a DPS item into skadi would be better? earlier on, it seems she'd manage a lot better with a maxed mana shield + ulti, thats a load of defense for a carry. and whos gonna give a shit about medusa if you can ignore her?

im thinking blood thorn might be great on her, it gives raw int, mana regen, damage, crit,further defense/utility and damage amp.  the only issues i can see is that orchid (NOT thorn, unless the description fails to mention the amped damage is magic) during her ult wont give the 30% bonus damage (stoned enemies have 100% magic damage resistance) - although if you time it right, it will - and the timing isnt that hard, at max level you orchid 2 seconds after ulti - or, if they run, anytime because they wont be getting stoned anyway. the next issue is the cost, but the buildup is easy, and finally, im not sure when you'd want to get the thorn.

maybe she just suffers from the same thing NP does? poor itemization and play style (i wont go into detail, but imo midas rush farm style is garbage)

early build might look something like treads/aquila/mask into orchid/casual demon edge.

Im unsure what would be best first - but all demon edge items are nice, maybe a crystalys instead of demon edge - bit less damage but you get the crit and your now 1k gold away from the bloodthorn. some really rough testing in demo mode i feel the crystalys is better, surpassing the demon edge due to the crits and then finish the bloodthorn easily for the guaranteed crits and true strike - its only 1000 gold now.

after that, id say skadi - pretty self explanatory, gives you everything medusa wants and your no longer doing terrible damage and can actually make use of the added beefiness, and while ive only done rough testing, for the extra 2k gold for the bloodthorne first rather then skadi, it seems to online her quicker and really fuck shit up - she no longer can be ignored until last, fighting her is hard and fighting other carries is also hard.

after skadi, id do the usual medusa stuff depending on what you need - id probably build a rapier, butterfly, daedulus, mkb, even sheepstick and obviously a consumed moonshard 6 slotted (+ another item for durability/ehp?)

still, i have reservations over the dps effectiveness (without rapier at least) - but i feel with this build/style you arnt really to concerned over dps, your still doing a good amount while being absurdly durable and a huge pain with ult and bloodthorn - being more of a supporting carry that still wants a lot of farm, that cant be ignored and is hard to deal.

what do you all think? - note: im not a great player, just throwing out some ideas and seeing if theres an alternative play style to a hero that i feel has had a stagnant build/play style with little innovation for years. but maybe there just isnt a build that can make her effective earlier, or maybe she'll still suffer from not making an impact if the rest of your team wont.



EDIT: Little extra, had a game where i built phase/wand/mask into dragon lance then diffusal 2, then skadi. it seemed to work really nice, i also played a lot more aggressive where appropriate - ganking with the right rune/timing, etc but still prioritizing farm. the game was going our way anyway, so i feel it needs more testing but i was for sure more impactful.is it allowed? eg if i wanted a second account, could i claim the referral on my main for the plex/1 month gametime?

also, does subbing immediately make you lose out on the 14 day trial? eg would it be better to wait for the trial to end while skilling, then sub at the end of it?Ive been a fan of techies since he was released, and only came back after he was.. fucked in the ass pretty much. I still love them, but [im not having a lot of success](http://imgur.com/a/2lYK9)

I offlane, solo if no one wants to pick a support with a stun, and i pretty much never lose lane - neutral at worst. Aim is to be like brood and be a huge pest, and after the t1 is down go mine jungle camps/lane. A lot of the time it doesnt get to that point and im needed elsewhere (thats something im not sure on - If i have a nice setup going i dont want to leave, but if i dont im not sure if should - i can at least get some aoe damage in or defend, but i could also be split pushing.

If the game is going well - wonderful. If its not, it ends in the exact same way: we get out shit pretty kicked in (or my team does, and im sat there wondering why i dont have 3rd skill IRL), followed by being locked inside our base for awhile until they eventually break through or we fail something (like contesting rosh)

It feels like when im behind all my plays are reactionary, and i dont make stuff happen or cant really contribute to something that would without setup (like someone stepping on a stasis, and luckily theres people close enough to do something). And transitioning early game success to midgame success when your teams done bad - since i guess all i really do is mostly defensively trap and try to get any free xp/gold


I want to keep playing techies, but its just so.. urgh. even the thing hes meant to be really good at (delaying the game to have your carries come online) seems to just fail in this bracket of bad players (i mean, yea im comparatively shit but wtf am i meant to do when ive taken the game to 50 minutes and carries still cant do anything?), yet nothing beats getting kills as techies... And i still play this arguably terrible hero because i keep telling myself i can just get gud, he has a 50% offlane winrate anyway, so i must be doing something wrong..


TLDR: Trouble being proactive going into the midgame when grouping starts and team is behind. What do.I Tend to play pretty aggressively, if my lane isnt seeing much action im probably leaving to go where stuff is happening, this tends to work great if we have momentum where i can help secure kills for towers and get deeper vision - not to mention have strong follow up for more pick offs.. but from behind i feel really useless if im playing a hero like rubick or oracle. i still get vision up, but if we lose map control it can be hard to get out to ward, make plays, etc. im not really sure what i should be doing to help turn the game around other then hope my cores can start doing something.

i think the worst i have trouble with is rubick, ahead or even i feel i can make a way stronger impact - but behind i just feel useless. its like my lift/stun doesnt really matter, fade bolt is extemely negligible and i really have to steal something high impact to turn it - but even with a (for example) ravage i just feel like more of a mild annoyance to the other team before my team gets wiped. as a carry, theres always late game to look forward to - maybe i can catch a solo pick off, split push, farm more, etc.. but as a support? hope and try to finish an item to help.

any advice? TLDR: having trouble with item versatility and justifying not-cookie cutter stuff; are BKB, diffusal, butterfly, skadi, shivas, AC worth considering; is value point magnetic field worth it.


I know what to build (or rather, most of whats viable on him - and core items) but im having trouble choosing what to build for counter items in general, rather then being pretty cookie cutter. also some item specific questions...

example: your against 3 agi carries (lets say slark, drow, SF) and 2 not problematic heroes, you got your bots, mael, SB, midas.. what do you build?

i would think one of: butterfly, skadi, shivas, AC the last 3 dont seem very good in general (again, AW specific) but they fit the i-dont-wanna-die objective and give some stats/utility... but dont seem the best.

butterfly evasion is a bit redundant, but isnt for slark - gives some armor from agi and 3 highly useful stats.. but just doesnt seem optimal - like, why butterfly for the evasion and 5 armor, if its just that? may as well go some better (for AW) offense item.

shivas seems nice, has a good active, but int isnt to helpful at that point and thats nearly 3k of the cost.

skadi slow isnt useless - but a lot of the time you will have a Q and kill before it wears off.. but health & armor from stats. no active though. AC is similar - never really considered it, but gives the AS and armor.

Or is all of the above shit and pretty much should never be considered, and doing something like pike & silver edge would be better for that scenario? But doing that i just feel so cookie cutter that i pretty much never deviate. bots, SE, mjollnir, bloodthorne (i dont see a game where i wouldnt build it at some point, orchid early for invoker etc..) every single game. Then for last 2 items i feel i just limit myself to pike, MKB and maybe hex.


Apart from the example items, the other items im not sure if are actually good (compared to alternatives) would be diffusal (last seriously played pre 7.0, unsure if this is still a good buy) and BKB.


And for hex... As an example, if im against tinker, or anything that a silence isnt good enough for, is it worth getting it early? like, after midas/bots/sb/mael for example.

Finally, its not related to items but why no value point in magnetic field at level 4? Is the extra damage and 10% slow on flux really worth giving up all the utility until later? i dont see how - even if your not against ranged, its still extra attack speed and useful with ult (being ""free"", sieging tower...)



Anyone know how to get it to work? Full screen is unbearable with dualboxing/browsing while playing. Enabling desktop capture doesn't do anything, not even recording desktop.So, randomly when i misclicked something id get that stupid close up view (showcase view i think).. After it happening in a teamfight i hunted that fucker down.

By default its ""I"", found under settings > horkeys > advanced hotkeys > 2nd column (camera actions) at the bottom. Now 0 chance of misclicking anything around it (like leveling up + leveling up stats right beside it) or fudging a control group. No fucking clue why its included by default.

So, anyone else got anything else thats simple (doesnt require relearning/hard integration) like that?


Some other minor stuff:

- Theres saved camera positions you can set

- (requires a bit of learning) make use of select all other units/select all units, it makes a lot of micro a lot easier. 90% of micro can be done using those keybinds (along with select hero)

- You can set courier hotkeys to deliver items, along with quickbuy. Set them together and you can quickly tap one after the other to buy items and deliver.

- Leveling up abilities with hotkeys, its in by default (O + ability, or O + U for stats) is minor but no need to manually click.Looking for what's in the title, all the videos I've found are pure shit - nothing with much educational value, it seems most youtubers think shit like ""and now I'm going to invade red"" as they walk to it is helpful information (i guess it's incredibly helpful... If your blind..). The stuff I'm looking for is mainly relating to high level macro play, invading successfully, using early leads to actually contribute to winning, playing the mid-late game, how to get back into the game as nid when you/your team's behind - etc. If anyone knows anything like I'm looking for that's general jungle (or even adc related) and not nidalee specific that would be fantastic.Im not a great draven, and i dont have a ton of games, but ive tried both and i  prefer rushing a DD. Usually i get DD > zeal > IE > RFC and it feels like after DD your guaranteed to be strong AF, while PZS build.. im not entirely convinced that 3 seperate parts before IE is the best way to do it, but IE first major item feels like you have to pray to RNG for crits to go in your favour, while DD's strengths dont rely on the same RNG - even if you do end up with 40% crit when you complete IE, you can still be completely fucked if it doesnt go your way.

surrogateuterus,5,6,"Like many of y'all, I struggle showering for long periods of time, longer than I want to admit. 

But today, even though it made me a little late to work, I treated myself to a full shower. I even washed my hair. Why? Because it's my birthday dammit, and I want to be clean for it. 

Thats all.

***Thank you all for the birthday wishes and encouragement. It was a pretty good day. Nothing crazy, just a good vibes kind of day***I'm so sick of seeing people show off how they paid off a big debt like a house or something and the ways they did it was to 

Sell their stuff on marketplace (ok, the only big ticket thing we've bought new in the last 5 years is a tv. The only tv we own)

Got rid of cable! (The only time I've ever had cable is when I got it free from my job working at the cable company)

Drive old cars so there's no monthly pmt (we have 2007 and 2013 vehicles.. no car PMT in 2 years)

Don't eat out every night (unless there's a particularly busy or sick week which does happen a few times a year, we only eat out of the home like once a week....I cook a lot)

We still struggle. What am I doing wrong? We just bought a new house and dropped our mortgage by $100 a month doing so.So. I'm not a huge fan of rap, but I'm familiar. But less so of Mary j Blige. Yet, Everytime I rewatch the Superbowl show (why do I keep rewatching???) I cry during her part. She was so pretty out there. I don't even know what she's singing. But it feels like something I feel. 


Can someone more fluent/aware of the lyrics or something explain to me like I'm 5??? Maybe my tears are misplaced? Maybe it's because she was the only woman in that spotlight. Maybe I have way too much in my own life and decided to just latch onto her performance... 

I dunno."
edge231,10,6,"[removed]Major telecom worker here. Collections department so we get the worst of the worst usually. 

This particular customer in question had an amazingly bad payment record and many nonpay service denials within the last year. On this particular day, it was the date that we had established for a payment arrangement to maintain active service. She had previously setup an arrangement, had broken said arrangement, was denied service, then managed to convince a rep to restore her service on a promise to pay for today. It was pretty much the end of the line, and she was asking for more time. 

Me: ""I'm sorry Ma'am, but I'm afraid we have reached the limit of how far we can extend you. You will need to keep your arrangement for today and make your payment or we will have to deny your service again.""

Cus: ""But you don't understand...it's not my fault this time!""

Me: ""I'm sorry but you haven't been keeping your arrangements.""

Cus: ""I know I haven't but this time you have to believe me! It's not my fault and I need more time!""

Customer proceeds to tell me a sob story about her life, involving her crappy ex-husband and abusive father. If it was true it was truly heartbreaking, but at the same time, completely unrelated to why she needed more time. 

Me: ""So is that why you need more time?""

Cus: ""Well no. I just told you that so you'd understand my life. You won't believe me if I told you why I need more time.""

Me: ""Ma'am, if you can give me an excuse I've never heard before, I'll consider your unreasonable request.""

Cus: ""The mail truck caught fire.""

Me: ""...wut?""

Cus: ""I actually did mail you a money order but the mail truck that was carrying the letter caught fire. I need the extra time to replace the money order.""

Me: ""...please hold.""

So I placed the customer on hold while I whipped out my phone. A quick Google search for news in her town showed that she was telling the truth. 

Me: ""Thanks for holding. How's the end of the month sound?"""
keredi,6,9,"Before my grandfather passed away in May, my family agreed to take his beloved dog, Max, once he was gone. Since then, my parents have divorced, my mother has moved out, and my father lost his job.

My dad wants to have Max put down because he has trouble walking up the stairs now, but I convinced him to wait two weeks while I find Max a new home where it won't be an issue for him. He's in perfect health otherwise. My mom can't take him in because she just moved to her new apartment and can't have dogs, my dad refuses to take care of him anymore, and I go to school in a city a few hours away.

Max can be difficult to take care of. He's a deaf, 10 year old white boxer, and he grew up as the only dog my grandpa had on an 80 acre property. He loves to be able to roam around but knows to stay to his property while outside on his own. He's extremely loyal and sweet, and he loves cuddles and scritches.

He's been neutered and is up to date on his vaccines. He would do best in a home without other dogs because he can be territorial, but he won't attack other dogs unless provoked - he's lived with our two dogs since May. He needs to be fed in a separate room from other dogs and not be disturbed while eating.

When my grandfather was nearing the end of his life, I remember seeing how gentle Max was around him, always staying right by his side. He’d walk around the cords for the oxygen machine and was careful not to jump up or disrupt him. My grandfather loved him so much, and I know he was worried about what would happen to Max after he passed away.

I know that Max is a good boy with a big heart and he deserves to have a loving home where he can flourish for his senior years. I don't want his life to be cut short for no reason. I've contacted all the boxer rescues in my area without success, and I'm worried that bringing him to a shelter would be bad for him as a boxer breed with special needs. If anybody here could possibly take him in, or if you know somebody who could, I'm in the SE Michigan area. Thank you.

Pictures of Max: [https://imgur.com/a/bJgAG9T](https://imgur.com/a/bJgAG9T)Hey everyone, a few weeks ago I made a post about needing to find a new home for Max. I was so touched by all the caring responses it received and I'm so happy to say that we've found Max a furever home <3 He's now living with a couple who has another white boxer, Junior! They had originally been looking for a deaf dog because the man is deaf as well, but it turned out that Junior, unlike most white boxers, is not deaf. So Max was the perfect fit for them! [Here's a picture of Junior and Max getting to know each other.](https://imgur.com/GBQxgOd)

Max is now getting settled into his new home with them, and at someone's suggestion from my original post we started Max on taking joint supplement treats daily, which we sent along with him.

Thank you for all of the help and encouragement. It really means so much to me to know that total strangers reached out in Max's time of need. I know he has many more happy days to come. <3Update: Winners are u/kalinka57 and u/TrophyWife1031! Prizes have been sent. Thank you everyone for your kind words, take care of yourselves and stay safe <3

 Hey RAoG! So GameStop made a splash [in the news](https://kotaku.com/gamestop-we-can-stay-open-during-lockdowns-because-wer-1842415962) yesterday for refusing to close, claiming that they counted as ""essential retail."" This left employees to deal with packed and understaffed stores in the middle of a pandemic. Some people chose to cancel their preorder; however, GameStop is requiring people to come in-store to cancel or switch to digital. Hmmm.

After significant pressure from the public and law enforcement, they've now shut down stores in a couple states. Great! But now there's no way for people to cancel or switch preorders if their store closed. Plus, even if your store is still open, you probably don't want to (and shouldn't) go in person!

So if you'd rather not support them, **I'm giving away a copy of AC: New Horizons from the non-GameStop retailer of your choice** – digital or physical (however, please keep in mind that physical items may face shipping delays right now.) If you already cancelled yours and bought a copy from somewhere else, I'll also be giving away **Animal Crossing merch, with your choice of**:

* Switch or Switch Lite carrying case or skins
* Plushes
* Amiibos/Amiibo cards
* Sticker book/sticker sets
* Pretty much any of the merch described [in this article](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acces/1100-6473188/) that's under $30USD and ships within the US or domestically within your country of residence (sorry, but I'd like to avoid delays/complications from international shipping right now)

To enter, please leave a comment with a fond memory you have of Animal Crossing, or something you're looking forward to if this is your first AC game! Also keep in mind that if you win, **you must provide proof of preordering** ***and cancelling*** **Animal Crossing: New Horizons from GameStop, or of preordering and your store closure.** Something like screenshots of emails or receipts work – if you win and you're not sure what you can use, I'll work it out with you :)

**Enter before the end of Sunday, March 22nd** and I'll draw and contact winners by the end of the following day. I'll redraw if I don't hear back with proof within three days. Take care of yourselves and stay safe, everyone! <3Giveaway has ended! I've PM'd the winners: u/Jarcies, u/Zealinne, u/972w, u/Akzopow, u/radrico, and u/Sherby123. Thanks to everyone for participating!

I got a bunch of RP a while back but I don't know anyone else who wants stuff, and I don't play anymore.

Can't gift RP directly without buying more, but I can use it for stuff like **skins, champs, icons, hextech crafting, those egg things, rune pages,** and **ward skins** (does anybody ever actually want those?)

Pretty sure it can be gifted to any region now that they've changed the system.

Post a number between 1-100 and something you'd like! I'll choose a couple winners in 24 hours with a random generator.Just got a Parfait Casey and a slip for myself, plus a bra and slip for my mom for a total of $60. Kohl's cash is on too!

Fridaywing,10,7,"So this happened some time ago. Probably 7 years ago and it still haunts me to this day.

It was New year's Eve. I lived in the city but during holidays, it was a tradition to visit my hometown and spend the holidays in there. In the province, I have a lot of cousins, dumbfuck cousins who are most likely qualified to become a member of jackass. Hours before midnight, we were already drunk and some of my cousins decided it was now time to play with the firecrackers. Now this is where it gets silly. We were all goofing around with the firecrackers, lighting one up and throwing it at one another then we run away from it, laugh, and do it again. Now our house is beside a narrow river so we have a small bridge beside our house that connects to the other side of the road. On the other side of that bridge is another house, a little house that doubles as a food shop.

It was all fun and games, we decided that it was fun to stick those triangular firecrackers in the crevices of the bridge and light it up. When it explodes, it shakes the bridge and we laugh about it. Those firecrackers that was supposed to be lit up then shoots towards the sky and explodes are being lit up laying down on the other side of the bridge while some of us stands on the other side. Fuck yeaah bowling style except the bowling balls are firecrackers and the bowling pins are humans.

For the finale, my cousin took out this firecracker that I believe is the devil reincarnate. It was the size of baseball with pure gunpowder inside. This shit is scary, when it explodes, it literally shakes your inside, it rips car tires to shred. So before the night ends, we lit two of those. BOOM! HAPPY NEW YEAR! bla bla, we exchanged drunken pleasantries and called it a night and went home. That doesn't sound so bad, right?

Morning came and when I woke up, there was a commotion outside. Lots of people are looking down the river and in the bridge. When I went to see what's going on. I shat myself.

The MOTHERFUCKIN FOOD SHOP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE IS MISSING. 
A lot of the furniture and items in the house are now floating or is now a furniture owned by the fish at the bottom of the river. Investigation results says that the soil underneath the house was already loose and it gave in. Thankfully no one died, the people who owns the house is on vacation.

As for me and my cousin, other than mother nature, we believe that we also have a hand on that incident, we never spoke about it and we console each other by saying that it was better that way, that we made it happen sooner rather than later and someone might have died.

tl;dr: played with firecracker on new year's eve, helped mother nature demolish a house beside river.I worked for a huge computer company as a tech support and I'm in the department where we handle laptop issues, this is the conversation that still cracks me up when I remember it.

This was my first job and I'm just 19, still new to the work back then probably around 4 or 5 months, maybe my responses are wrong, maybe we can really bypass that EULA, but after all the computers I have set up, I don't think EULA can be bypassed."
ClasslessHero,2,7,"Thanksgiving 2021 I told my family it would be the last that I host and that other arrangements were necessary. My nMom responded to this with ""let's have a conversation next fall, it's easiest for everyone if you host."" No it is not easiest for everyone. It is incredibly difficult for me, and I loathe it. It stresses me out for weeks and I *always* have to tell you that you *cannot* stay in my apartment. Every. Single. Year.

A month later at Christmas 2021, my mother tried to make me do something that would cause me emotional pain. Several times I calmly told her ""no"" and she escalated the fight by screaming at me to ""just do this"" as I decided to walk away. I haven't spoken to her since I left that house on 12/26 except for one text message where I stated my boundaries. I told her that I would only speak to her if we were going to have an open and honest conversation with boundaries placed on both of our behavior, and that if any boundaries were crossed I would hang up the phone and we would not try again. Essentially, she gets one shot to get this right. She hasn't earned that chance, but *I* want to give it to her. She hasn't taken me up on my offer, and my eDad has tried to get me to ""see it from her perspective."" When I asked if they tried to see it from mine, he didn't answer. Hmmm... it's almost like this isn't the first time.

In the 8 months since December, my nMom has sent me numerous texts asking about my life, wishing me good luck on various things, asking for advice while shopping for something, and other things that are nowhere near my stated terms. I do not respond. These are questions someone that has a healthy relationship would just answer, but we do not. Recently I received the archetypal text from an nParent. A text designed to make me feel guilty. 

The text stated that they didn't know where they'd be for Thanksgiving - an attempt to subtly ask if I was still hosting (I am not.) However they'd welcome me home for Christmas... as long as my grandmother's health doesn't fail. Her intent as always was subtle, but she wanted to send the message that *I'm missing out on grandma's last few months by fighting with *her.**

That, too, received no response. 

Oh, grandma is nGrandma too.

It's sickening that she would leverage the health of my grandmother to get her way, but that's the way of the nParent. Nothing matters to them apart from *their* wants and *their* needs. I've given her a solution to her problem - she can show some effort to change, but she'll have to admit she made mistakes. She will have to apologize without going into the typical *""blame it all on me, it's always my fault""* sob story. 

Nobody can see the future, but I think everyone with nParent(s) can guess how this story ends.My league has two owners who I find to be unbearable.

I'm a college graduate who just signed my first post-grad lease on an apartment with my roommate. We are looking into acquiring furniture for our bedrooms and the living room of our 2-bedroom space.


I've already decided to purchase a great mattress - it's a third of your life don't cheap out - but I am unsure what is a better use of my money at this age. Should I purchase furniture that is high quality and built to last for a long time, or should I get some Ikea furniture (or comparable quality and price) that will essentially be useless in the future?

Thanks for the help all.Since the trade deadline, there has been a lot of discussion on this sub regarding the actions of the Front Office and the Ricketts. To generalize the opinions, the voices have fallen into two groups 1) ownership took the cheap route and did not spend enough money to win, and 2) something other than money (poor player development, regressing stars, bloated contracts, etc.) prevented this team from winning another world series with this core. To address these voices I did some statistical analysis to answer the evaluate the statement “If the Cubs front office and ownership spent more money, they would have won more games” Not everyone has the appetite to read through a statistical analysis, so I kept the content about model validity out of this post. For those with an appetite for this content [you can see this in a temporary github I made.](https://github.com/classlessthrowaway/wins_analysis) It's a throwaway account because I don't want to connect my professional work to my reddit username. Anonymity! Yay!

**Datasets**

I built a dataset via manual data entry (lots of fun!) that pulled payroll from [baseball prospectus](https://legacy.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/index.php?cyear=2015) and wins from the MLB website. I used the years 2015-2019 because 1) the Cubs contended in those years and 2) the seasons are complete and not impacted by COVID (including the shortened 2020 season would require a couple of statistical adjustments that I didn’t believe were worth my time). The dollars are in millions, as in $100,000,000 is 100. 

If there is a different source for dollars that you prefer, great! You can edit the csv file in the github repo and run my code locally on your machine. Feel free to share the results.

**Quick Exploration**

[I made a simple scatterplot.](https://github.com/classlessthrowaway/wins_analysis/blob/main/dollars_wins_plot.png) The goal is to predict wins based on dollars spent, so I put dollars spent on the x-axis and wins on the y-axis. The plot shows a general trend, in that the big spenders usually aren't terrible; however, there isn't a really tight linear band of data. This suggests that any trend is likely to be weak. A plot like this is cannot be conclusive, there are far too many non-mathematical ways to interpret a plot, so a statistical analysis is required.

**The Model**

[I built a simple linear model](https://github.com/classlessthrowaway/wins_analysis/blob/main/Analysis%20Outputs.png) to determine if there is a statistical connection between dollars and wins, the strength of the connection, and the explanatory power of the model. The most important part of this is the explanatory power of the model – in short, this means the model’s ability to accurately predict dollars spent. Again, for anyone with a greater appetite for statistics, feel free to read the jupyter notebook in the github.

The results of the model are in the link above. To be brief, the model passed all statistical assumptions required to be a valid model, and dollars has a statistically significant (albeit small) impact on wins. Despite being a valid model, the outputs confirm that dollars spent is weak predictor for wins. The R-squared is 0.116, meaning 11.6% of the variance in wins is explained by dollars spent. Therefore 88.4% of the variance in wins is explained by *something else not in this model.*

**Conclusion -  are you still reading? Why?**

Spending more money would not necessarily lead to greater on-field success - something else caused the Cubs' shortcomings. If the front office had spent $20M more (slightly less than one Jason Heyward), this model would predict slightly less than 2 additional wins, even then, the model is not a strong predictor for wins as the sum of other factors are significantly more impactful than spending money. This model and analysis supports the second group at the start of this post because additional data would be required to build a model that accurately predicts wins.

You might be wondering, what is that additional data? I do not know. My goal was to test the claim that a lack of spending prohibited the Cubs from winning more, not build an exhaustive model to predict wins. Feel free to fire away any questions you may have about the model I built, my methodology, becoming a data scientist, etc. If you have a statistical analysis that contradicts my analysis, share that too! I'm interested in it.With Encarnacion signed, I feel as though Tyson Ross is the most intriguing player left. On one hand, he didn't survive April last year and has a myriad of shoulder problems. On the other, he has been phenomenal the last few years.


Now that he was non-tendered and is available, what team best suits him? I get the feeling he wants to play for a team where he can compete without being rushed to the big league level. My personal favorite pick is the Pirates because they have a history of bringing pitchers back from the dead, and they will likely need another arm in the second half to compete with the Cubs and Cardinals. Anyone else have a prediction?For me, it's BO Robbie Ray for the Drabek program. His 4-seam tops out at 95/96 which is pretty fast, but he has a great curve and his changeup, 2-seamer, and slider all look the same coming out of his hand. You can mix those 3 pitches locations and keep a lot of players guessing as to what pitch is thrown, and if it is a ball or a strike. After the success I've had racking up K's and W's with him, he could always be my 5th starter."

David Marcus, president of EBay Inc.'s PayPal unit was on Bloomberg today where he said:

> And I think here, for us at PayPapl, it's just a question of whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal's funding instrument or not, and we're kind of thinking about it right now.

Here are the links to [the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1d078f/paypal_sees_20_billion_in_mobile_transactions/) and to [the video](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/paypal-sees-20-billion-in-mobile-transactions-WlokACTBRterdjHAJGNB6w.html).

**[Update:]**

A lot of people are really missing the *big picture* here! If PayPal accepts Bitcoin as a funding instrument, it will open up the flood gates for spending Bitcoin and it will have numerous other benefits:

* **You will be able to spend your bitcoins on eBay!!!**
* **People from all those countries currently not supported by PayPal can now fund their PayPal accounts with Bitcoin!**
* PayPal provides consumer protection!
* Merchants will get Bitcoin payment processing directly from PayPal!
* They may even be a sort of ""proxy exchange"" where the average Joe can buy Bitcoins with money from their credit card or bank account.

Talk about groundbreaking!!!

**[Update 2:]** Sorry for the error in the title, the guy is the President of PayPal not the Director.I invested in Bitcoin in June of 2012 and I've done pretty well since then. Today I was posting bond for a friend of mine who was booked on a drug-related charge and I sold some BTC to cover the bond. I had to produce statements from MtGox in order to show how I obtained the money. I was grilled by the prosecution for about 30 minutes regarding Bitcoin. The prosecution had looked up some stuff in Bitcoin and they were trying to argue that I might have obtained the money by illegitimate means (i.e. laundering money), but their arguments were dismissed pretty quickly by the judge. Mind you that pretty much nobody in the court room, including the defense, had any idea what Bitcoin was when we started.

**Some of the questions I was asked by the prosecution:**  
1. Is it true that Bitcoin is not regulated by any state?  
2. You are aware that MtGox is not a registered money transmitter?   
3. Bitcoin is not a real currency in the sense you can't use it in Wal-Mart, is that correct?  
4. Your MtGox account is not an investment account, such as a traditional mutual fund, stock or options, correct?  
5. Is it true that Bitcoin is not the official legal tender of any country or jurisdiction?  
6. Is it your understanding that Bitcoin is not regulated by FinCEN?  
7. Do you realize gains from the rise or fall of the current Bitcoin price?  
8. Do you know how Bitcoin mining works?  
9. Do you mine Bitcoins?  
(there are many other questions in the span of 30 minutes, but these were the ones that stood out)  

**My answers:**  
1. Yes, it's a decentralized currency so there is no country or state that controls it.  
2. Objection by defense and sustained.  
3. Is that relevant? (the judge said that he's going to determine if it's relevant and I should just answer the question) ... Yes, you can't use it in Wal-Mart. It's not a traditional currency in that sense.  
4. It's not a traditional investment account, but it's no different from investing in currency. (the judge and the prosecution went back and forth here about how one can invest in Dollar/Yen, Dollar/Euro and they agreed that it's an investment)  
5. Objection by the defense (asked and answered) and sustained.  
6. Yes. Objection by the defense, but it was overruled and I had already answered the question.  
7. Yes. It works just like any other investment: you buy in at a certain price and you sell at a different price. If I have profit, then that's a capital gain.  
8. Yes.  
9. No.  

**Statements by the prosecution (most of them dismissed by the judge):**  
1. Bitcoin is used for money laundering and other illegal activities.  
2. Bitcoin is not a real currency.  
He went on about how it's not regulated, it's not real currency and it's used for illegal activities such as money laundering, but the judge dismissed it saying that it's irrelevant. They also tried to suggest that money obtained from Bitcoin is not traceable, but the judge agreed with the defense that the statements from MtGox are sufficient to prove where the money came from. The judge also made statements that this seems to be in line with any other investment and it should be accepted as a legal source for the bond.  

**Closing statement from the defense (this was the best part):**  
""Some people like to keep their money in the bank, some keep it under the mattress and some invest it in geeky stuff like Bitcoin. **(the whole courtroom, including the judge, erupted in laughter)** However, that's not grounds for rejecting the bond. It is entirely reasonable that the witness, who is x-years-old, not married, has no children, has no mortgage and makes x amount of money per year is capable of producing the bond amount.""

All and all, it was pretty fun to be up there and testify in defense of both my friend and Bitcoin. I'll try to get the court transcripts and post them up here, it was pretty entertaining to see the prosecution struggle with Bitcoin.[Bitcoin calls Litecoin a Pyramid Scheme](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Litecoin)

> Since the aforementioned reasons mean Litecoin has no future potential, it effectively functions as a pyramid scheme, rewarding those who get in sooner at the expense of those who adopt it just before it finally fails (and are left with nothing). This is not the case for Bitcoin, since it has significant potential to become a long-term currency and continually be beneficial to adopters no matter when they begin using it. 

Seems like an inaccurate statement, but despite seeing multiple requests in the discussions section to remove this criticism, it's still there. Litecoin neither qualifies as a Pyramid Scheme nor as a Ponzi Scheme:

[Pyramid Scheme](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/042104.asp)
And I quote

> As its name indicates, the pyramid scheme is structured like a pyramid. It starts with one person - the initial recruiter - who is on top, at the apex of the pyramid. This person recruits a second person, who is required to ""invest"" $100 which is paid to the initial recruiter. In order to make his or her money back, the new recruit must recruit more people under him or her, each of whom will also have to invest $100. If the recruit gets 10 more people to invest, this person will make $900 with just a $100 investment. 

Litecoin doesn't promote itself as an investment opportunity, nor does it require people to recruit other people in order to secure ""residual income."" There is no recruiter and there is no kick-up to the top. Ultimately, even if Litecoin is a bad idea, it still does not qualify as a Pyramid Scheme.

[Ponzi Scheme](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp)

1. A fraudulent investing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to investors.  
2. The Ponzi scheme generates returns for older investors by acquiring new investors.  
3. This scam actually yields the promised returns to earlier investors, as long as there are more new investors.  
4. These schemes usually collapse on themselves when the new investments stop.  

Note that for it to be an actual Ponzi Scheme, it would have to pose as an investment opportunity **promising** a high rate of return. Litecoin doesn't promise that, nor is it intended to be an investment opportunity. There is a big distinction between a bad idea and a Ponzi Scheme. If people invest in something inherently flawed, they do so at their own risk and nobody is promising them any returns. The same is true for Litecoin: it's designed as a digital currency and not as an investment opportunity.

It's quite disheartening to see this kind of criticism going coming from the Bitcoin wiki when we've seen so many similar claims. Even the Bitcoin wiki offers similar defense against people labeling it as a Ponzi Scheme:

> Bitcoin describes itself as an experimental digital currency. Reuben Grinberg has noted that Bitcoin's supporters have argued that Bitcoin is neither a security or an investment because it fails to meet the criteria for either category. Although it is a virtual currency, some people see it as an investment or accuse it of being a form of investment fraud known as a Ponzi scheme. A report by the European Central Bank, using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definition of a Ponzi scheme, found that the use of bitcoins shares some characteristics with Ponzi schemes, but also has characteristics of its own which contradict several common aspects of Ponzi schemes.

So let's be intellectually honest and not label Litecoin a Pyramid Scheme or a Ponzi Scheme simply because we find it inferior to Bitcoin. Please stand up for intellectual honesty and expect a higher standard of intellectual discourse from the Bitcoin community.

Edit: Quit my job, went back to sleep, woke up to an exploding thread. Glad I'm not alone.“Now at this very moment I knew that the United States was in the war, up to the neck and in to the death. ***So we had won after all!*** How long the war would last or in what fashion it would end no man could tell, nor did I at this moment care. We should not be wiped out. Our history would not come to an end. Hitler's fate was sealed. Mussolini's fate was sealed. As for the Japanese, they would be ground to a powder. All the rest was merely the proper application of overwhelming force.”I've been trying to eat healthy for almost two years now, so I've made my fair share of mistakes and learned quite a few tricks. Like many of you, my tendancy to swing by McDonalds instead of eating at home is the direct result of not having food at the house. This is my plan of attack to avoid this expensive and unhealthy habit. Some of this info may be redundant, but hopefully you'll glean some new ideas from my approach.

First off, I do all my shopping/cooking/prep on Sundays, but you just need to pick a day when you have a solid couple of hours to devote to shopping and cooking. You'll need a good knife, cutting board, sandwich baggies, Mason jars, [Foodsaver Mason jar sealer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005TN7H/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), [Foodsaver vacuum sealer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWIVCA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), crock pot, can opener, and spices.  (The Mason jars and sealer aren't necessary, but I've found that it keeps the food fresher for longer periods.  You can even freeze them.)

For breakfast, I like to keep it simple and quick. I try to combine some carbs with a little protein and fat. A typical breakfast for me is a banana and some walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, or a boiled egg. I also really enjoy [Larabars](http://www.amazon.com/LARABAR-Fruit-Apple-Gluten-Free1-6/dp/B000ENUC3S/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1415813459&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=larabars+apple+pie), but those may be out of your price range.  For me they are worth the price ($1.26/bar).  I also keep a supply of [homemade granola](http://paleomg.com/paleo-granola/) on hand for breakfast and when I get a craving for something sweet. And I cannot tell you how delicious this [granola](http://imgur.com/zbv7ctl) is.  I was giving it to everyone at work because I just had to share it.  Trust me on this one.  Anyway, one batch of granola usually lasts me about two weeks.  I also [bag up fruit/veg](http://imgur.com/pkomLBX) and freeze it to be used in smoothies.  As you know, nuts can be expensive, so I highly recommend finding an Aldi in your area (really great prices on nuts of all varieties) or investing in a CostCo membership ($55/year).  

Lunches are equally simple.  Each Sunday I buy a variety of unprocessed fruits and vegetables.  Two pounds of carrots ($1/pound), three cucumbers ($.50-$1 each), a 10oz bag of spinach greens or kale ($2/bag), celery ($2/stalk), apples, and grapes.  Feel free to choose whichever fruits and veggies suit your fancy.  I also buy 2 dozen eggs ($2.50/dozen for Eggland's Best).  From CostCo I buy a 3 pound bag of [walnuts](http://www2.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?prodid=10277909&whse=BD_827&topnav=bd) which lasts me a month minimum.  Again, feel free to include whatever foods you really enjoy.  I've used lunch meat, cheese, yogurt, and many other delicious, nutritious, and cheap options.

For preparation, all I do is peel, cut, and bag up the carrots and cucumbers.  I stuff sandwich baggies full of spinach and kale (usually makes about 8 bags).  Boil, peel, and bag up the eggs (three eggs/bag).  Bag up the walnuts into 1/4 to 1/2 cup portions.  Bag up the grapes.  The end result should look something like [this](http://imgur.com/odHvFhc) or [this](http://imgur.com/VohqpmD). Total prep time: 15 minutes.

*Please note: I ran our of baggies, so the carrots are all in one bag.  Also, I was boiling more eggs when I took this picture, so all the eggs are not accounted for.* 

When I leave for work in the morning, I grab a banana and one egg or a banana and some nuts or just some granola for breakfast.  For my lunch box I grab one bag of carrots, one bag of cucumbers, one bag of kale/spinach, one bag of grapes, one bag of eggs, and one bag of nuts.  In order to keep my appetite in check, I eat in small meals usually consisting of one or two bags or a carb/protein/fat combo.  This keeps my energy levels and brain function consistent throughout the day. The total cost per lunch comes out to:

Carrots: $.40

Cucmbers: $.60

Spinach/Kale: $.80

Eggs: $.63

Fruit: ~$1

Walnuts: $1

Total: $4.43/day

For dinners, I love to use my crockpot.  This week I made [chicken tacos](http://www.food.com/recipe/crock-pot-chicken-taco-meat-4957).  I also really love to make [carnitas](http://ourfullplate.com/recipes/crock-pot/crock-pot-pork-shoulder-pernil-carnitas-style/).  Over the past few months I've been perfecting [my](http://imgur.com/Cxbeul1) [bolognese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqBqiGM1O54) which is delicious and very versatile. [Orange chicken](http://www.health-bent.com/poultry/paleo-orange-chicken) is great with rice or stir fry.  As you may have noticed, I try not to eat bread and grains, but by all means please feel free to do so.  Chicken tacos/[carnitas](http://imgur.com/RJFfvdj) with tortillas or taco shells or Spanish rice and Bolognese with pasta are filling and very cheap and very easy to add veggies.  

Once the crock pot dish is finished, I divide it up into portions and store it in Mason jars to be eaten throughout the week.  I usually make two crock pot dishes on Sundays, but you may find that one is enough or you have enough variety from freezing/saving the meals from previous weeks.  Try [roasting some veggies](http://imgur.com/G6nSroS) to eat as a side dish.  Just do what works for you.  I like to keep veggies on hand for quick stir frys during the week as a change up.  Sometimes I just eat a rurkey and avacado sandwhich loaded with lots of veggies.

So that's how a lazy, single guy like myself is able to maintain cheap and healthy eating.  I've cut my food preparation down to just a few hours per week.  I'm eating healthy food that I enjoy and rarely prefer fast food over what I have waiting for me at home.  

Comments, questions, suggestions, observations, and critiques are welcome.  I hope this helps!

1.  Once you save 25x your yearly expenses, you can retire

2.  The rule of 72 - dividing 72 by the interest rate earned on an investment will give you the approximate number of years it will take for your money to doubleI have always wanted a small house. Even when I looked at apartments for rent, I always asked the property manager if they had a studio or efficiency apartment first. Over the past few years, I have gotten into the tiny house movement. Until recently, I was never sure why I have always valued small spaces. 

But I realized that having a cluttered home stresses me out. I realized that if I live in a small place, it would be very difficult to own a lot of things. If I do not own a lot of things, my home can never be cluttered. If I have cheap rent and do not own a lot of things, I can save money. Having savings makes me feel secure. Being able to load all my possessions onto a small trailer gives me security in knowing I can up and leave whenever I want. No inanimate objects hold any sway over my decisions. This makes me feel like I am in control.

If I had a huge mortgage, car payment, and all the toys, I would not feel in control. If I lost my job, I would lose my enormous home and brand new cars. There is just something about minimalism that makes me feel free, at ease, and happy. In a way, it has become my overriding  philosophy on life. It guides me in everything I do, and I love it."

akatherder,6,5,"With the federal Reverse Repo likely to hit $2T today and assuredly by the end of the month, you may be asking yourself ""what is reverse repo and why is it important?""  Before you get started, understand this is not an exposé or even DD; this is just everything I think we know about RRP.

#What is Reverse Repo?

In short, Repo and Reverse Repo are just swapping money for securities for a pre-defined period of time.  Then you swap back and someone pays interest.

_Repo_ is a Repurchase (RP) Agreement.  You take out a loan and you give someone a security or a basket of securities.  Then when a pre-defined term is over, you pay back the loan plus interest and you get your securities back.

Reverse Repo (RRP) is giving a loan to someone and they give you the basket of securities.  Then at the end of the predefined term, you get your money back plus interest and you return the securities.  In the case of Overnight Reverse Repo (ON RRP) the term is overnight and the interest is .8%.  It's a one day loan from ""the participants"" to ""the Fed.""

#Who are ""the participants""?

I bet it's them fukin hedgies... Well it isn't.  4 different groups can play with RRP: Primary Dealers, Money Market Funds (MMF), Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), and Banks. Oh so I bet it's them fukin banks.  No, they are the least likely to participate of the 4 groups.  From the data available from June 2021-March 2022 90+% is Money Market Funds.  Then GSEs (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) account for 5-7%, then Primary Dealers are most of the rest.  Banks are usually $0.  The most I've seen is $1B which is a lot of money but not out of the $2,000B we are currently approaching.

#What is a Money Market Fund (MMF)?

This is a different MMF that what I'm used to.  Vanguard, Fidelity, Blackrock, JP Morgan, Schwab, etc.  They all have Money Market Funds.  They are low risk, low yield boring as shit investment baskets.

Here is Fidelity's SPAXX.  68% of the $230B fund went to Reverse Repo as of 4/30/2022: https://imgur.com/LvUWZ9C  Each participant can only pledge $160B per day so they are pretty close to maxed out.

This spreadsheet shows the participants and how much they contributed (scroll to 3/31/2022 since data is reported 1 month behind): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14qTmA0AnFKO1_n7487PrkfPymVGWW_Xo/edit#gid=1422479142

This spreadsheet comes from the fed except the last column I added.  That shows how much interest they are being paid.  The ""reward rate"" was .05% annualized starting on 6/17/2021.  On 3/18/2022 it was raised to .3% and on 5/5/2022 it was raised to .8%.  So the vast majority of the time, $1M-3M was being paid out in interest/reward.  That jumped to about $14M (.3%) and now it's about $40M (.8%).  

#Why are we following this?

Here's a graph of RRP usage: https://imgur.com/Fo0C7nt Notice it was barely used and then kicked off in March 2021 and just keeps going up and up and up. Actually going back a little further, this dude named Zoltan Pozsar said that offering 5 bps (.05% annualized) RRP is kinda whack.

> “yesterday we could not even get a basis points a year; to get endless paper at five basis points from the most trusted counterparty is a dream come true”.

> 5 bps is too generous; it will upset the state of “singularity”. Like heat-seeking missiles, money market investors move hundreds of billions, making sharp, 90º turns hunting for even a basis point of yield at the zero bound – at 5 bps, money funds have an incentive to trade out of all their Treasury bills and park cash at the RRP facility.

Specifically he set a bar of $1.3T by last summer (which it did not reach at that time) but he said:

> If you think about reserves as a deck of cards, that deck of cards will be reshuffled

Those comments were all it took for us apes to start following this very sexy, very large number.  It changes every day and it's fun to watch it grow.

#Why does RRP usage keep going up?

The ""technically true"" answer is that it's the best investment available.  Remember Zoltan Pozsar scoffed at .05% (5 bps)?  Now it's at .8% (80 bps).  One day term with the most trusted counterparty.  Sign me up too yo.  

What we're really asking is, why is RRP the best investment available to all the participants?  Why is the fed making it so attractive?  THAT is what we don't know yet.  Is the Fed bailing/helping out ""the participants"" or does the Fed need money from the participants?  We know ""banks"" are not using RRP, but the vast majority of participants are MMFs run by banks so how different is that exactly?I have a Windows 10 desktop that won't connect at 1 Gbps when it's plugged into my new (gig) switch.  It connects at 100 Mbps. All of my other gig devices are connecting at 1 Gbps and the desktop can get gig speed from another switch just fine.

I can unplug the ethernet cable from my desktop and plug it into my work laptop.  The laptop connects at 1 Gbps.  So I know the cables are all good (5e+) and they are capable of providing a 1 Gbps connection.

I can go to the other end and plug my desktop into a different switch and it connects at 1 Gbps.

The reason I have 2 switches at the moment is because I'm currently renting a modem/router combo from my ISP.  I want to get rid of that, but it seems that my desktop can only get gig from that particular switch.

Any ideas?  The computer, cables, and switch all seem capable of handling gig, just not all at the same time the way I want it set up.I have a router/cable modem gateway from xfinity.  I'm only using it as a cable modem.  My mesh hardware is acting as the router.

After setting my xfinity gateway to Bridge Mode I cannot connect to it anymore.  It is not on http://10.0.0.1 because my mesh network uses 192.168.1.1.

I know I can have the gateway perform the router and cable modem functionality but I have a requirement to change my DNS server, which the xfinity gateway does not allow.

So how do I connect to my gateway once it is in Bridge Mode?I just ordered a Blizzard CX1 Pure Suction.  We needed a vacuum but this was an impulse buy...  I know Miele's reputation and we wanted bagless so I jumped on it.

It hasn't arrived yet but I'm starting to get worried.  I wrongly assumed this thing was going to have a powered head.  I wanted a ""buy it for life"" carpet vacuum but I think I bought a glorified kitchen sweeper.

We do have very short looped pile carpet.  Kind of like this: https://imgur.com/MO1B9xB.jpg  Is there any way to retrofit an actual powered head on this thing?  Or is the additional air-powered brush (STB305-3 TurboTeQ Turbo Brush) a difference maker?  Or am I worrying about nothing and the included attachments will be fine?"
SolasV,6,3,"Let me preface this by first saying that, normally, I would be in favor of PC gaming (although I do a fair amount of both). However, for school, I am writing an argumentative speech concerning PC vs Console/Handhelds, and I chose to support the latter because I think it would be more interesting to see points and the general perspective from the other side. Now, most online articles are fairly ""PC Master Race""-y, and the few in favor of consoles generally have comment sections or other responses filled with high concentrations of toxicity, so I would like to start this discussion here, where I hope everyone will be more civil (which really isn't hard to do, given that I mean ""more civil than angry anonymous internet comments on gaming articles"").

Now, for the actual arguments I have come up with so far-
1) Cost/Accessibility- Generally, a console will cost less than an analogous computer. While Steam seems to have more sales than, say, the PS Store, the initial investment is nearly always less, especially compared to the higher end gaming PCs that have the specs and processing power boasted about in PC-favoring arguments.
2) Specialization and Optimization- Consoles are designed with doing one thing well- playing games. With the latest generation of consoles, this is pretty true. In general, I feel that console UI is also more user friendly than on PC, where I may need 3+ different clients (Steam, Origin, Battle.net, etc) for all the games I may want to play. Furthermore, not only are consoles designed for games, games are also designed for console. A lot of companies seem to make their game with consoles in mind and port over to PC, leading to poor optimization (Dishonored 2 and one of the Arkham games graphically, the Dark Souls series control-wise).
Disclaimer: I am new to Reddit and have no idea how to format these posts. As is fairly obvious by the giant wall of text...

Alright. First thing first: This theory is based only on the English version's text. The Japanese fextralife wiki does not have flavor texts of items up yet and I do not know where else to look for them (or translations). I'm not very good at Japanese anyways, so a translator who has the text would be appreciated! Furthermore, if I miss some vital piece of information, please comment! This is supposed to be a place of discussion, not for me to drone on and on about my own tiredly constructed thoughts. Anyway.

As the title suggests, my current theory is that Irithyll and Eleum Loyce (of Dark Souls 2's DLC) are either the same place or relatively close to each other. This is mainly from the item description of the Profaned Greatsword: ""[Sulyvahn] discovered the Profaned Capital and an unfading flame below a distant tundra of Irithyll."" This is quite easily inferred to be the Profaned Flame, mentioned in many other item descriptions. For instance, the Gargoyle weapons state that their fire powers come from the perpetually burning Profaned Flame. Anyway, the Flame was discovered by the Pontiff in a ""distant tundra,"" which could easily have been the location of Eleum Loyce. Specifically, the Flame was found ""under"" the tundra. Anyone who fought the Ivory King in Dark Souls 2 would remember the massive drop down to the Old Chaos arena. Of course, it can also be argued that the place under the tundra is the Profaned Capital. The one part that does not seem to make sense, however, is that the Profaned Greatsword's description says a ""faraway"" tundra specifically. The Profaned Capital is fairly close to Irithyll. Either way, it could also be said that the Profaned Capital was built atop the Old Chaos, which would explain the Gargoyles, seemingly inanimate beings, move and attack (after all, Eleum Loyce possessed golem technology... which made the playthrough that much more annoying). The only other logical explanation is that the Profaned Flame came from a distant land and was relocated to the Capital.

It's also interesting that the Old Chaos is believed to be the remains of the Bed of ~~Bullshit~~ Chaos arena from Dark Souls 1. This would make the idea that Irithyll is close to Eleum Loyce even more likely- The Bed of Chaos's arena is accessed from Lost Izalith through the ridiculously long slide of fun and joy. It's not a stretch to say that Smouldering Lake, which is right before Irithyll (kind of), are the remains of Lost Izalith, albeit much less fiery. The many demon corpses around the place seem to parallel the many lesser demons in Izalith. The giant Carthus Sand Worm might be one of the smaller ambushing worms of Izalith grown colossal (kind of like the Crystal Lizards). It's also fairly obvious that there are direct references to Izalith in the Demon Ruins, like the Fair Lady's corpse being in it and the Quelana pyromancy tome also being nearby. There are many other connections with the past games, such as Tsorig wielding the Fume Ultrafunsword and the Black Knight fighting the Abyss-creature-like Ghrus, which could connect the location to the Iron Kingdom (or even Drangleic, as that is wear Raime originated from), Izalith once more (the Black Knights fought Chaos Demons, presumably in Izalith) and Oolacile/Darkroot (Ghru's association with the Abyss) respectively. 

Concerning the Loyce Knights, the ~~Pontiff Knight~~ Outrider Knight spirits wandering Irithyll are seen wearing a helmet fairly similar to those of the warriors of Eleum Loyce. Specifically, both sets of knights wear a sort of visor and are characterized by long, thin necks. However, the weaponry used by the knights are very different. Still, it is fairly easy to see the similarities. Perhaps Sulyvahn saw these knights of Loyce (or the remains of these knights) and was inspired to make his own knights based off of them.

Another point to be made is that Karla is found in a cell in Irithyll Dungeon, fairly close to the Capital. She is a child of the Abyss, much like Nashandra, Alsanna, Nadalia, and Elana were in Dark Souls 2. The most important part of this is that children of the Abyss (or, specifically, Alsanna) are shown to be able to keep the Old Chaos at bay by praying. This might also explain why Karla is in Irithyll Dungeon- Sulyvahn might have been inspired by the Profaned Flame and wanted it to spread, so he declared Karla (the person keeping the flame in check) a heretic and threw her in the dungeon. After that, the Capital might have then burned down, with nobody there to subdue the fire. There is a further connection to be made, found in the description of the Eleonora:

""The Profaned Flame was triggered by the curse of these women, relatives of a certain oracle, but despite their culpability, they went on living, without any cares.""

This might have been unintentional, but it should also be considered that the children of the Abyss's names are spelled differently in Japanese, with the notable differences being Nadalia and Elana's names. They are Nadra (written ""Nadora"") and Elena (written ""Erena"") respectively. The weapon Eleonora (Japanese: Ereonoora) seems to be an amalgamation of the names of the fragments of Manus, but I have no idea where the ""onoo"" comes from. The main hole in this theory, however, is that Alsanna's name does not have the word for ""Oracle"" in the original Japanese. I do not have the Japanese item description for the Eleonora but it might still have some connection with Alsanna that the translation team changed to signify a relation with some oracle. 

Back to the main point- the Eleonora says the Profaned Flame was caused by the ""curse of these women."" It is very unspecific who ""these women"" are. It seems that it is referring to the previously mentioned ""inhabitants of the Profaned Capital,"" so it is likely that it belonged to the Jailer Handmaidens. It would certainly be interesting, however, if it did actually refer to the relatives of Alsanna. The ""curse"" they bear would probably be their association with the Dark and the Abyss. It would certainly explain why the Profaned Coal allows for the infusion of Dark and Hollow as well (I have no clue about the Blood though... the only connection I can think of is the Abyss Watchers, which would also show a connection with the Abyss). Perhaps these women were to keep the Chaos Flame's power in check but created the Profaned Flame using their Abyssal abilities, kind of like what the Witch of Izalith did when she created the original Chaos Flame.

Keep in mind that many people have interpreted the beginning monologue that says that ""the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge"" to mean that, like how time is all screwy in the three games, space is as well (Random note: Transitory means ""not permanent""). However, the Profaned Greatsword's description makes it fairly obvious that Sulyvahn discovered the Profaned Flame prior to the awakening of the Unkindled, and, thus, prior to the convergence of the homes of the Lords.

As you guys can tell, this entire theory revolves around one basic idea- The Profaned Flame is either the Chaos Flame or some kind of derived entity. There are many parallels between the two- both seem to be unfading (the embers, which appeared in Dark Souls 1, are implied to be perpetually burning in their natural state in the description of the Dull Ember in the sequel), both have ""shards"" that power pyromancies and weapons (see ""Profaned Flame,"" the spell), and both are found in coal/ember form that allows you to infuse your weapons with Chaos. The Fire Witches' set also says that they were the leaders of the Pontiff Knights whose hearts were ""consumed"" by the Profaned Flame. This is very similar to what happened to the Charred Loyce Knights in Dark Souls 2. Andre's dialogue for the Profaned Coal implies that it also has some connection with the Abyss. As mentioned in the section about Karla, this could be because the women of the Profaned Capital, who are most likely associated with the Abyss, created the Profaned Flame while keeping the Chaos Flame from destroying everything. Perhaps the Chaos Flame and the Profaned Flame are one and the same, but no definitive evidence has come to my attention.

In the end, it is your choice to interpret this as you like. Hopefully this post will inspire some sort of discussion that could lead to a better understanding of the Dark Souls universe.

Edits: 
1) Formatting, hopefully made a bit easier to read...
2) OUTRIDER, not Pontiff Knights. Same idea though.
3) Karla section added!
4) Fire Witch set mentioned.What were some uses of Stands that you wished happened, but never did?
I'll start:

Bruno using Sticky Fingers like... Sticky fingers. As in open a zipper on a wall and on his hands and connect them to cling to objects.

Alessi turning old man Joseph into part 2 Joseph, even temporarily.

Echoes Act 3 and rhyming w/ three.

Echoes Acts 2 and 3 in general. While we're at it, throw in non-spatial erasure by the Hand.

GE's heightened thought processes and senses (when punching a human) being used to GioGio's advantage (perhaps needing to hear something quiet, see far, etc, but with downside of loss of body control. Or just like on a math test or something.)

Josuke using CD on a small chip of a rock or something while holding it, pulling him to where it originally was (kinda like with the post in the Enigma arc)

Edit: Thought of another one- Chariot Requiem switching Diavolo and Doppio forcefully.http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/solasv

Featuring lots of cat puns, inspired by r/catsareliquid. I also posted this to the weekly draft thread, but said threads usually do not get as much attention as these posts.

I'm pretty happy with most of the article, but am still trying to think of a good wait to end it off, as the current ending doesn't really have a good punchline or anything, as seen with http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3900 (which was one of my inspirations). Furthermore, if anyone has a picture of a cat walking in the rain that I could use for the article, that would be dope.http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_large/6/67663/3085984-62.jpg

I saw a painting (presumably Renaissance) that depicts the same pose Giorno is in on this cover. Does anybody know the name of that painting?

EDIT: I'm gonna describe what I remember- the painting depicts a godly-looking figure (Jesus?) at the top, who is completely nude, but has a cloth draped around him in a way nearly identical to that of the one surrounding Giorno. I believe there are people underneath him as well.

EDIT 2: I'm fairly certain I'm thinking of this: https://www.google.com/search?q=italian+renaissance+painting+jesus&tbm=isch&imgil=lVP9B_imx5NWYM%253A%253BCp4F71_H8x-iqM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.pinterest.com%25252Fexplore%25252Frenaissance-art%25252F&source=iu&pf=m&fir=lVP9B_imx5NWYM%253A%252CCp4F71_H8x-iqM%252C_&usg=__2slsqGk6FVs4ue96A9VEr2LzkfU%3D&biw=1440&bih=794&ved=0ahUKEwipxtLrnPbUAhWDFj4KHeh1DtUQyjcIPw&ei=dP9eWam8M4Ot-AHo67moDQ#tbm=isch&q=renaissance+painting+resurrection&imgrc=z8p_o3ummOBSLM:The bonfire is called Mausoleum Lookout. In Japanese, it is called ""王廟の見張り."" Unless I am misinterpreting the first two characters, this means ""Lookout of the King's Mausoleum"" (though it could mean kings', plural. The Japanese term just combines the word ""king/lord/emperor"" and ""mausoleum."") For the word ""Lookout,"" it seems to specifically mean ""guard/watchkeeping,"" not just a place to view something. 

Now, what Mausoleum specifically is it talking about? There are two possibilities that immediately come to mind. Firstly, the Shared Graves bonfire. I doubt its this, as I'm not even sure you can see it from the first bonfire. Furthermore, the Japanese clarifies it as a ""public cemetery/共同墓地,"" not really a king's mausoleum. The second choice seems to be that one building that was plastered all over the promotional material/trailers for the DLC- the building with a bunch of structures that are the same as that of the Ringed Sword of Avowal. This might be an answer as to what that building is, as we don't find out much else about it (as far as I know). The ""king"" in the Japanese bonfire title likely refers to the Pygmy Kings. Thus, it may mean that the building contains the dead pygmy lords.My father and I are currently arguing over whether or not Okinawa (and the Ryukyu Islands in general) are counted as part of Japan. Currently, the matter of debate is whether or not the following part in the 1971 Reversion Agreement means that Okinawa is recognized legally as part of Japan:

>With respect to the Ryukyu Islands and the Daito Islands, as defined in paragraph 2 below, the United States of America relinquishes in favor of Japan all rights and interests under Article 3 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan signed at the city of San Francisco on September 8, 1951, effective as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Japan, as of such date, assumes full responsibility and authority for the exercise of all and any powers of administration, legislation and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants of the said islands.

From my understanding, this body of text means that the return of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan makes the region ""part"" of Japan. However, my father's argument is that the text simply implies that Japan gains administrative control over the land, WITHOUT actually owning it. He says that this is due to China's refusal of recognizing Okinawa as part of Japan. Furthermore, he brought up the Cairo Declaration as being evidence of Japan losing sovereignty over the region:

>...Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first World War in 1914... Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed.

Most sources I see list Okinawa as part of Japan. Furthermore, I'm fairly certain that people living there are considered citizens of the country.

So, is Okinawa legally part of Japan? If I got any information wrong in the above paragraphs, please, correct me. I'm by no means an expert on the subject.

EDIT: Also, if this helps, ""legally"" means ""accepted by the UN"" to my father. If that is not the case, once again, feel free to provide evidence against that."

Hi Rabbitors! Several months back, my friend received two buns from a woman who told her they were both male. Soon after that, one of them gave birth to 2 babies, having been pregnant the whole time. My friend neutered the husbun as soon as she could, but unbeknownst to her, when Thumper gave birth, she'd already gotten pregnant *again* that same day before the litter was even discovered, and later gave birth to 8 more (*rabbits*.........).

My buddy did her best, but now she has 6 baby buns in urgent need of homes. She's a great bun owner, but simply doesn't have the space to care for them all. Shelters and Craigslist are inundated with buns right now and she really doesn't want to have to sell them to a pet store, but most of the people who have offered are backing out for personal reasons and time is running out.

They're healthy, super sweet, and very adorable. The crew is as follows, all sexed by a vet for certainty (and labeled in the imgur album).

Qtip & Marbles- 2 females, 14 weeks old (first litter)

Sandy & Coco- 2 females, 10 weeks old

Skidmark & Coffee- 2 males, 10 weeks old

My friend is on a time crunch and doesn't have the room for them as it is, much less if they get older and need to be further separated so they don't breed. If anybody lives in AZ (or within driving distance in neighboring states; willing to drive for the right people or possibly meet halfway) and is looking for a new, young bun companion or two, or knows someone who is, please email her at  **lecapnnat at gmail.com**, subject ""Baby Buns"". You can also message me and I can try to relay any questions back to her, but please shoot her an email if you can take one or more of these babies!

Thanks! I hope this post is alright, I looked through the wiki resources but thought this might be a better bet, since some of those sites haven't had activity in weeks.I don't know how I'm going to get down all of the multitasking that's required to drive, but I don't have much of a choice, as I live in the 99% of the U.S. with next-to-nonexistent public transportation. Worse, every driving course I can find is around 6 hours of behind-the-wheel instruction, within which they take you from never having driven to driving on the freeway. As a slow learner this is practically unthinkable to me.


So I'd like to hear other ADHD-PI experiences with learning to drive. How did you deal with the sheer amount of stuff you have to deal with simultaneously? Or am I just overthinking it?[tb]

Rush2201,3,4,"First off, I don't hate this game. I'm a bit underwhelmed by what we've got, but also impressed at the *potential* of this game. The vehicles, having multiple bases/planes/squads and missions that can take up to 16 people, there is a TON of potential to make some seriously epic battles with that. I also like the free-aim and locational damage. I even applaud the change to the cover formula, though there are small issues with step-out and return fire that should be addressed.

The biggest problem with this game is that it needs **more.** More enemy types, more weapon tiers, more mission types, more maps, more classes/levels/abilities, more customization, more everything. I've played it for a few days, and I haven't been able to really dig my teeth in because there just isn't enough there. Other people complain about the music/UI/story, but I just want some variety in the battles. Arthrons, Tritons, Mindfraggers, Sirens, and Chirons just aren't enough, and the faction enemies are even more boring. There's barely even a tech-tree to research, and faction research is all or nothing. We need to slow the progress rate down a bit, but spread the rewards out more. The Phoenix Initiative, imo, should be able to take the faction equipment and design improvements or even merge functionality with other faction gear. Right now it feels more like Phoenix is just joining one of the factions instead of being it's own. Whatever direction the game takes, it just needs more.

Now that it's released, hopefully the updates will come faster and the lack of content will be addressed. I really look forward to what this game could become in time, and I'll be watching for updates."
-BipolarPolarBear-,8,9,"There's a bit of backstory. I was never forced to go out or anything as a child, so I spent many long hours playing video games instead of making friends. I've always had a few friends through school, but I'd never visit them out of school or anything. 

Now, I go to a all-male boarding school and I am a senior. I've made some very close friends here who I'd call brothers and family at any time. The school has given my fitness and confidence to speak to adults, but not people my own age. I'm awkward about it. I've started to get better at small talk but I don't know how to get to deeper conversation.

My personal issue is this awkwardness. It's led to me being lonely many times, but I've wanted to get out and socialize more the older I've gotten, but I don't know how to do it. I don't know when it's okay to walk up to someone and say ""hi"" in a public space, or what to say past that. In the past, I've always been able to lean on whatever class I'm in as a common subject, but I don't know how to talk to people out in the real world. I'm almost terrified to talk to strangers, but if they're older than me I'm fine. I want to know how to get over my problem and be more normal and make friends outside of school.

TL;DR: I'm generally socially awkward, and I want to learn/get better at talking to/approaching peers in places outside of schoolPats defeat Steelers 36-17The would you rather post has almost 200 comments and 10 upvotes. C'mon guysClemson did it! Woo

  This is the time of year for many people to find both domestic rabbits and wild rabbits outside due to Easter and baby season.Since Easter is rolling around soon, we figured a PSA on Easter rabbits would be a good idea.

# First, a PSA. [RABBITS DO NOT MAKE GOOD PRESENTS.](https://imgur.com/gallery/MXJZv9J)

If you are thinking of getting/giving one, PLEASE THINK CAREFULLY. Check out [our page on deciding to get a rabbit.](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Deciding)

* Rabbits live **8-10 years** on average and can live 15+ in the right circumstances.

* At 4-6 months, rabbits hit sexual maturity and can often become violent and destructive. They will need to be fixed at this point. Spaying and neutering can cost between US$50-300+.

* Female rabbits have a **high incidence rate of [uterine cancer](https://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Uterine_Cancer)** if left unspayed. Spaying can cost between US$50-400+.

* Most rabbits HATE being picked up. They are prey animals and may bite if handled incorrectly.

* Rabbits “freed” in the wild typically live **less than 24 hours.**

* Many people are **allergic** to the hay that is an essential part of a rabbit's diet. Owners should be aware if this is the case with them or their roommates and decide if this will be an issue for rabbit ownership.

* Proper medical care from a **rabbit-savvy veterinarian** can be expensive and difficult to find. Many emergency hospitals will not staff veterinarians that will see exotics like rabbits 24/7, which can end up leading to highly stressful situations when your rabbit needs immediate supportive care. Rabbits are prey animals that are great at hiding problems until they are major emergency issues. 

# If you have just been given your first rabbit as an Easter present:

Welcome to our community! We hope that you and your rabbit have a great and long relationship.

* To **get started,** please take a look at [our sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/about/sidebar) and the [Getting Started](https://bunny.tips/Getting_Started) guide and [New Rabbit Owner Primer](https://bunny.tips/New_Rabbit_Owner_Primer) for general rabbit care information. The article [""Helping Rabbits Succeed in Their Adoptive Home""](https://spring2019.iaabcjournal.org/setting-everybunny-up-for-success-3/) is also a great resource on how to build a relationship with your new rabbit.

* If your rabbit is **younger than 8 weeks** you may need to take them to the vet. Rabbits on average wean their babies from 6-8 weeks. Any rabbit younger than that may have health problems. Here is our [guide to rabbit vets.](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Choosing_a_rabbit_veterinarian)

  * If you obtained a baby rabbit under 8 weeks old, please be extremely careful of introducing any new foods as their digestive systems are still developing. They should ideally still be drinking milk and living with their mother until naturally weaned around 8 weeks, but if your baby rabbit is already on hay and pellets and any other solids, continue the same diet with no change until they are older - there is no need to additional supplement any formula or milk. 

  * Optimally, you should be feeding the same brands of food as the breeder or organization where you obtained the baby rabbit from. If you would like to transition their pellets to another brand, increase the amount by 25% per week and make sure their poop continues to look normal. **Any diarrhea is an emergency, and the baby rabbit should be seen by a [rabbit-savvy veterinarian](http://bunny.tips/Vet) for fluids and treatment.** Do not introduce any vegetables to your baby rabbit until they are at least 12 weeks old, and only in small amounts, one at a time.

* The **appropriate diet** for a rabbit is 80% [hay](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Hay). Rabbits should ALWAYS have unlimited hay available. If your rabbit is **younger than 6 months,** they should be fed unlimited alfalfa hay and unlimited “young rabbit” (higher protein and calcium) [pellets](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Pellets). This gives them the nutrients to grow big with strong teeth and bones. If your rabbit is **older than 6 months,** slowly transition them to a rationed amount of adult rabbit pellets and timothy hay. Here is our [guide on diet](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Diet) for more information.

* Please make sure to keep your rabbit up to date annually with any [**vaccinations**](http://bunny.tips/Vaccinations) available in your country. Most rabbits should be vaccinated against myxomatosis or rabbit hemorrhagic disease.

* If you have a **rabbit cage from a pet store,** it is DEFINITELY too small! Your rabbit make look like they fit now but when they reach their full adult size, they will not have the room to hop. Here is our [guide on rabbit housing](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Housing) for ideas on proper rabbit housing.

* At **4-6 months** your rabbit will hit rabbit puberty (sexual maturity). They may become aggressive and destructive. This will mean that it’s time to get them [spayed or neutered](http://bunny.tips/Spay). Here is our guide to [rabbit vets.](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Choosing_a_rabbit_veterinarian)

* If you have **2 baby rabbits** either take them to a rabbit vet or take a look for their gender on your own. It is VERY common for even breeders to incorrectly gender-identify baby rabbits. If you have ended up with **two rabbits of different genders,** make sure to separate as early as 3 months to avoid “oops babies.” If you have **two rabbits of the same gender** make sure to watch them starting at 3 months since rabbits of the same gender can become territorial after puberty and start to fight. In all cases, you will need to separate them, get them fixed, and [go through the bonding process](http://bunny.tips/Bonding) after healing.

* **If you are overwhelmed and can no longer take care of your rabbit, PLEASE DO NOT LET THEM GO INTO THE WILD.** ""Freed"" rabbits typically do not live longer than 24 hours. They do NOT have proper survival instincts. Instead, [contact your local rabbit rescue](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Rabbit_rescues) and look at our [guides for rehoming.](http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Rehoming_your_rabbit)

I thought not...

It's not a story *Jane's Fighting Ships* would tell you.   It's a KGB legend.

*Kremlin the Ultimate* was a battleship, so powerful it could defeat an entire United States taskforce of Iowa class battleships and Midway class aircraft carriers. Her 18 inch gun turrets were such mechanical marvels for her time that they literally defied physics thanks to anti-gravity technology and could be swung from side to side almost instantly to engage multiple ships on either flank.  She had such a powerful anti-aircraft armament that her flak literally blotted out the sun and could take down entire carrier wings before a single piece of their munitions hit her hull.  The Russian architects who designed her developed a legendary schema of using layered armor decks to bounce plunging large caliber AP shells in a way that many naval architects would consider unnatural.

*Kremlin the Ultimate* became so powerful... the only thing she was afraid of was being purged, which eventually, of course, she was.  Unfortunately, the secret files of her construction were passed to the KGB, who also fearing the power the ship would give the Russian Navy made sure she was scrapped by Stalin before she became fully sentinent in her drydock.  It's ironic the ship which could have literally given the Soviet Union naval domination of the oceans almost single handedly was single handedly scrapped by a single stroke of Stalin's pen.Hey guys, my family has incredibly sensitive skin and when we touch most plastics or metal we break out in hives almost instantly.

This guide is intended to help Belgians getting started with investing through ETFs (exchange traded funds). It is loosely based on the [bogleheads approach](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy). For more information, see the [Investing from Belgium](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investing_from_Belgium) bogleheads wiki page.

### 1. Taxes & compliance costs

There are three main costs associated with index funds. These are:

- Taxes to the Belgian government
- Unrecoverable tax losses: also known as dividend leakage
- Management fees and internal transaction fees

#### 1.1. Belgian Taxes

There are ~~four~~ three taxes relevant for Belgian index investors ([NL](https://www.wikifin.be/nl/themas/sparen-en-beleggen/sleutelvragen/belastingen)/[FR](https://www.wikifin.be/fr/thematiques/epargner-et-investir/questions-cles/la-fiscalite-de-lepargne-et-des-placements)). 

* **Tax on transactions**: on every security transaction (buy and sell) there is a tax of 0,12% in case the ETF is registered on a list maintained by the European Economic Area. Otherwise it is 0,35% in case it is not registered in the EER and 1,32% in case it is registered in Belgium.

* **Tax on dividends**: there is a 30% tax on dividends received from securities you hold. The main reason why Belgian index investors opt for accumulating funds.

* **Tax on capital gains (bonds)**: on funds that consist of at least 10% bonds, there is a 30% tax on capital gains when you sell. Officially this only applies to the bond section of a fund, however some banks and brokers withhold 30% of all capital gains of funds which consist of at least 10% of bonds. Contact your bank or broker to inform about their policy.

* ~~**Tax on trading accounts**: a yearly withholding of 0.15% applies on all trading accounts larger than 500,000 euro’s.~~ Deemed unconstitutional and was abolished in October 2019.


For a detailed overview of Belgian taxes, including other sorts of investments such as individual stocks, see [the flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/BEFire/comments/glmj1l/belgian_taxes_on_most_common_investments_a/) made by /u/KenpachigoRuffy.

#### 1.2. Dividend Leakage

**Dividend Leakage** is an unrecoverable tax loss, which occurs whenever a foreign company inside an index pays out a dividend to its shareholders.


Whenever a company inside an index pays out dividend to its shareholders, your fund needs to pay taxes. These taxes are based on the tax treaties in place between the country in which the fund is domiciled and the country in which the companies inside the index are domiciled. Also the location where you are domiciled (Belgium) is relevant. In case your fund is domiciled in the US, a 30% dividend tax should be paid. However, because Belgium has a tax treaty in place with the US, this is reduced to 15% dividend tax. In case you would select a distributing fund, this dividend would be further taxed by the Belgian government (30%, as seen in 1.1). On a hypothetical 2% dividend - which is approximately the dividend you would receive from a globally diversified index fund - you would have to pay 0,81% in taxes: 0,02 x ( 100% - (0,85 x 0,7)) = 0,81%. Note that since 2018 it is almost impossible to buy US-domiciled ETFs in the first place as most fund providers do not want to comply with European legislation regarding PRIIPs.


It is beneficial to select ETFs domiciled in Ireland, as they are more cost effective than holding US domiciled funds or Luxembourg domiciled funds. Just like Belgium, Ireland has a treaty in place with the US which means only a 15% dividend tax should be paid to the US. However, unlike Belgium, **Ireland does not tax dividends** at all; whenever the Irish fund distributes a dividend, the Irish government does not tax it. The Belgian government however, still will tax the dividend with 30%. Accumulating funds which reinvest the dividend in Ireland before it is distributed in Belgium do not trigger a taxable event in Belgium. It is therefore advisable to choose **accumulating funds domiciled in Ireland**. Repeating the same calculations as above, a hypothetical 2% dividend is now only taxed at 0,30% a year: 0,02 x (100% - (0,85)) = 0,30%. Additionally, because your fund is domiciled in Ireland, you do not have to worry recovering the tax on dividends in Belgium, as this is done by the Irish domiciled fund. Thanks to [trackerbeleggen](https://www.trackerbelegger.nl/indexbeleggen-vanuit-belgie/) for the explanation.


An overview of unrecoverable tax losses will come later. For now, a partly overview can be found in the [Dutchfire](https://old.reddit.com/r/DutchFIRE/comments/bnh6ce/overzicht_kosten_populaire_fondsen/) subreddit. For funds domiciled in Ireland and Luxembourg these are 1:1 translateable for Belgian investors. Note some of these funds are distributing thus subject to tax on dividends by the Belgian Government. In particular IWDA and EMIM are 1:1 translateable for Belgian investors, while VWRL is comparable to VWCE.

#### 1.3. Management fees & internal transaction fees

Other main costs is the **management fee**. [The Total Expense Ratio (TER)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ter.asp) is a measure of the total costs associated with managing and operating a fund. It is usually a yearly percentage automatically deducted from your share value.

#### 1.4. Euro-denominated funds & currency risk

**Currency risk** is the impact of exchange rates upon your overseas investments. Even though stock market prices might not change, the price of your shares can increase or decrease as a result of fluctuations in their underlying currencies. There are three important currency labels which apply to funds: the underlying currency, the fund currency and the trading currency.


To explain the difference, I will explain the process of purchasing IWDA, listed on both the Amsterdam (in EUR) and London (USD) exchange. A lot of what I will explain is true for other ETFs as well.

**The underlying currency**: IWDA is a worldwide tracker, with only about 9% of the underlying shares being traded in EUR. The other 91% of underlying shares are being traded in other currencies, such as 60% USD, 8% YEN, and so on. Because currencies can change in price in relation to another, this poses a risk called currency risk. As a European investor, most of your own capital will be in EUR. Therefore, since you are investing 91% in foreign currencies, 91% of the underlying value invested in IWDA is subject to currency risk. Because YOUR own capital will always be in EUR, this 91% will always be true, regardless if you were to invest in IWDA listed in Amsterdam (in EUR) or in London (USD). Had you been an American investor, your own capital would have been in USD, and only 40% of underlying shares would be subject to currency risk.


**The trading currency**, being EUR and USD respectively, does make a difference. If a European investor was to buy a fund listed in London (and traded in USD), he would pay an additional exchange rate conversion fee at the time of purchase and sale. If the investor was to buy the same fund, listed on Amsterdam (traded in EUR), nothing would have to be exchanged to a foreign currency, so no additional exchange rate conversion fee would apply.


The trading currency does NOT alter your exposure to foreign currencies (a European investor will always have his own capital in EUR, and will therefore always be exposed to the underlying currency risk, no matter what currency his purchased funds trade in). Therefore, it is only logical to buy funds in your own currency.


**The fund currency** simply refers to the currency that a fund reports in; NOT the currencies of the underlying securities which pose a currency risk. Is is generally based on the currency used for the underlying index (in this case MSCI). Note that for distributing funds dividends are distributed in the fund currency. Your broker will automatically convert this into your currency for an additional conversion fee.


**Hedging**: It is possible to hedge your funds against relative currency fluctuations, and thus to protect them from currency risk. Hedging is a form of ""insurance"" in which [derivatives are used to make offsetting trades with negative correlations](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/hedging-beginners-guide/#the-bottom-line), eliminating any currency fluctuations that happen. This hedge comes at a cost, usually about 0,20% extra management fees. Because global equities naturally tend to [hedge each other as rising currencies are offset by falling ones](https://www.justetf.com/uk/news/etf/the-effect-of-currencies-on-etfs.html), it might not always be advisable to use hedged equity funds due to their increased fees.


In fact, most buy-and-hold investors ignore short-term fluctuation altogether. For these investors, there is [little point in engaging in hedging because they let their investments grow with the overall market](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/hedging-beginners-guide/#the-bottom-line).

**In conclusion**, when buying worldwide index funds, every investor (whether European, American or other) will be exposed to some currency risk due to the underlying shares being traded in foreign currencies in relation to their own. Purchasing worldwide trackers in a different trading currency does NOT change this fact, and only costs more due to addition exchange rate conversion fees at the broker. Therefore, it is best to purchase funds in your own currency. Due to the unpredictable nature of currency valuations, most investors simply accept currency risks for their stocks, although it is possible to hedge against this risk for an additional fee by investing in hedged funds.


#### 1.5. Conclusion on taxes & compliance costs


As a Belgian index investor, you are looking for **widely-diversified Euro-denominated low-cost accumulating ETFs domiciled in Ireland, from a reputable ETF provider**. This way, the costs are kept to an absolute minimum:

* Tax on transactions: 0,12% whenever you buy or sell a position.

* Tax on capital gains for bonds: 30% tax on capital gains whenever you sell. 

* Dividend leakage: Approximately 0,30% yearly unrecoverable taxes paid to foreign governments when investing in worldwide trackers, automatically deducted from the share value.

* Management fees: Between 0,10% and 0,30% yearly management fees, automatically deducted from the share value.

* Currency Risk:  If you are an European long-term investor, purchase a fund which is listed in EUR. For the equity portion of your portfolio, it is possible to ignore currency risk altogether, as hedges would only cost more money for something that is likely irrelevant long-term.


### 2. Funds - Equity


#### 2.1. Indices


The are **two major indices** used by fund providers: MSCI and the less popular FTSE Russel. While they both offer broadly diversified, market capitalisation-weighted indices, there are small differences in both methodologies and performances, which is why you should not mix them.


The first difference between the two indices is whether they count certain countries as developed or emerging markets. South Korea is classified as an emerging nation by MSCI but has been promoted to developed market status by FTSE. Therefore South Korea is included in FTSE’s developed market index but not its emerging market one, and vice versa for MSCI (Source: [justetf](https://www.justetf.com/uk/news/etf/msci-vs-ftse-which-etf-provider-is-the-best-index-provider.html)).


The second difference is index composition and weights. Because South Korea is classified as an emerging nation by MSCI, the contrast in index composition is clearer in the emerging markets. The lack of said country in the FTSE index means they redistribute the weight over other countries.


The third and final difference is small-cap firms. MSCI world captures 85% of the global investable market, and exclude the bottom 15% as small-cap firms. FTSE all-world invests in approximately 90% of the global investable market, and only excludes 10% as small-cap firms. This is because FTSE defines some firms as large-cap, while MSCI defines them as small-cap. This also explains why FTSE tracks more companies [(3,928 vs 2,849)](https://www.justetf.com/uk/news/etf/msci-vs-ftse-which-etf-provider-is-the-best-index-provider.html), although their small size tends to limit their impact.


**Avoid mixing index providers** in your portfolio. If you were to combine MSCI world with FTSE Emerging Market, you would not have any exposure to South Korea. For a correct market distribution, it is important to use funds which follow the same index so that all countries, sectors and firms within your portfolio follow the same methodology.


While it is true the FTSE emerging markets has proven to have better performance than its MSCI counterpart up until now, the costs of the fund following the index are more important than the index construction over long-term. Chapter 2.3 will give an overview of the most popular funds used by Belgian index investors looking for global market exposure.


#### 2.2. Fund replication methods


The goal of each ETF is to replicate its index as closely and cost-effectively as possible. Various methods have emerged to replicate the index. The classic method is **physical replication**. If the ETF directly holds the all securities of the index, this is known as full replication. The development of the underlying index is generally captured well by physical trackers. 


Full replication is not always possible. Other replication methods, such as **synthetic replication** allow to invest in new markets and investment classes. Synthetic ETFs are able to replicate some indices more efficiently and better through swaps ([justetf](https://www.justetf.com/uk/academy/etf-replication-methods.html)). In case of synthetic replicated ETFs, the ETF does not invest in the underlying market, but only maps them. Because of this, some synthetic trackers, as well as short trackers and leveraged ETFs [do not follow the index as accurate as fully replicated ETFs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwjPi_zds4voAhXQ_KQKHaxRDOMQFjAAegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bolero.be%2Fuploads%2Fmedia%2F54464ee38b392.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1vvjxCLeqozK1N6Z_yHcAS). It is therefore recommended to always choose physical replicating ETFs.

#### 2.3. All-World, developed and emerging markets

Following the [Bogleheads® Investment Philosophy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads®_investment_philosophy), we are looking for **diversification**. For Belgians, this means **worldwide market exposure**, as we generally do not have a home bias (for Belgium or Europe) although exceptions certainly are possible. Some popular funds for worldwide diversification are:


Popular and generally reputable providers are iShares, Vanguard, SPDR and Deutsche Bank.

#### 2.4. Combining funds

To have worldwide market exposure in large cap either pick VWCE or a **combination of developed (88%) and emerging (12%) markets**. It is advisable to only combine funds which follow the same index (MSCI or FTSE).

#### 2.5. Size and Value factors

Other factors have been identified to further increase expected returns. Most notably **Size and Value** as explained in the [three-factor model by Fama and French](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/famaandfrenchthreefactormodel.asp). Value stocks have a high book-to-market ratio (as opposed to growth), whereas size simply refers to small companies outperforming big ones. It is very difficult to get proper market exposure to these factors with the limited amount of funds available for European investors. For most beginners the best advice is to stick with a market weighted portfolio consisting of developed and emerging markets as explained in chapter 2.3. and 2.4. If you are looking for additional exposure to the size and value factor consider following funds:

Small Cap World | Ticker | TER | Index | ISIN
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
iShares MSCI World Small Cap UCITS ETF | IUSN | 0.35% | MSCI | [IE00BF4RFH31](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00BF4RFH31&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00BF4RFH31)
SPDR MSCI World Small Cap UCITS ETF | ZPRS | 0.45% | MSCI | [IE00BCBJG560](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00BCBJG560&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00BCBJG560)

Small Cap Value | Ticker | TER | Index | ISIN
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
SPDR MSCI USA Small Cap Value Weighted UCITS ETF | ZPRV | 0.30% | MSCI | [IE00BSPLC413](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00BSPLC413&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00BSPLC413)
SPDR MSCI Europe Small Cap Value Weighted UCITS ETF | ZPRX | 0.30% | MSCI | [IE00BSPLC298](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00BSPLC298&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00BSPLC298)

Note that the fund size for ZPRV and ZPRX are small, which might indicate a **low liquidity and high tracking error**. Larger funds (unlike ZPRV and ZPRX) are often more efficient in terms of internal costs (tracking error) and are much more profitable for the fund provider. In other words, fund size is a good indicator for the funds durability and popularity. Unprofitable funds are more liable to liquidation. This means either you or your provider sells your shares, and you'll receive the net value of your ETF shares at the time of sale. It does not mean ZPRV and ZPRX are at risk of liquidation, per definition. They are serving a niche. Just keep in mind these risks whenever you decide to invest in small funds such as ZPRV and ZPRX.

### 3. Funds - Bonds

**Investing can be risky**. Generally speaking, the riskier an investment, the higher your expected returns. The goal is to choose an asset allocation which suits your risk profile. Bonds offer a way to reduce volatility of your portfolio and match your risk profile. [Meesman](https://www.meesman.nl/zo-werkt-het/1.-uw-beleggingsmix), a reputable index fund broker in the Netherlands made a table which can act as a general rule of thumb for your investment decisions and asset allocation between stocks and bonds. As can been seen, when investing for a duration shorter than 5 years, stocks should be avoided as they are too volatile an asset class. This allocation slowly shifts towards more inclusion of stocks the longer your investment horizon.

Max. acceptable (temporary) loss | 0 - 5 jr | 5 - 10 jr | 10 - 15 jr | 15 - 20 jr | > 20 jr
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
-10% | 0/100 | 0/100 | 0/100 | 0/100 | 0/100
-20% | 0/100 | 25/75 | 25/75 | 25/75 | 25/75
-30% | 0/100 | 25/75 | 50/50 | 50/50 | 50/50
-40% | 0/100 | 25/75 | 50/50 | 75/25 | 75/25
-50% | 0/100 | 25/75 | 50/50 | 75/25 | 100/0

As opposed to equity funds it makes sense to opt for hedged funds as it reduces volatility considerably. The most popular options out there are:

Fund Name | Ticker | TER | ISIN

iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF EUR Hedged | AGGH | 0.10% | [IE00BDBRDM35](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?query=IE00BDBRDM35&groupField=index&from=search&isin=IE00BDBRDM35)

### 4. Brokers

There are a couple of Belgian and foreign brokers available, the biggest **Belgian brokers** being Binckbank and Bolero. Smaller ones like Keytrade and MeDirect are also available. **Foreign brokers** still available to Belgians are Degiro and Lynx. The lowest fees are available at Degiro (Custody account), if you're willing to file your own taxes. The benefit of choosing a Belgian broker is that they declare all taxes automatically. Degiro only does part of it (tax on transactions), Lynx not sure. The cheapest Belgian broker is Binckbank, followed closely by Bolero. The only downside of Binckbank is that is was recently bought by Saxobank, which in its turn is owned by chinese investors. Bolero is owned by KBC which is quite a sizable bank in Belgium. 


In short: if you're willing to partly file your own taxes, Degiro has the cheapest rates with a custody account. Otherwise Binkbank or Bolero both seem logical choices.

In case you pick Degiro, some funds are included in their core selection which means you can trade them for for free once a month or continuously in case the transaction size is larger than 1,000 euros and the transaction is in the same direction as the previous transaction (buy -> buy and sell -> sell. Buy -> sell and sell -> buy are not free).

### 5. Sample portfolios

A popular choice is **IWDA and IEMA (88/12)** on Degiro. Both IWDA and IEMA are part of the core selection of Degiro which allows you to purchase them for free once a month (or more in case explained above). Another popular option is **IWDA and EMIM (88/12)**, as EMIM also includes emerging markets small cap. Note that IWDA does not include developed markets small cap, to which IEMA is complementary if you wish to exclude small cap exposure. The main reason EMIM was so popular is because it was the cheapest option until the TER was lowered for IEMA.


A second popular choice is **VWCE**. This is a single fund which essentially accomplishes the same as above. It is available at most brokers, and my personal choice for simplicity above everything else. Note that this fund is currently only available on XETRA, which might imply higher transaction fees at your broker. Also note that some brokers - including bolero - charge a higher TOB (Tax on transactions): 1,32% instead of 0,12% whenever you buy or sell a position.


A third option - much like the first option - is to combine **VGVF and VFEA (88/12)**. While they are not part of the core selection in Degiro, the total costs when accounting for dividend leakage are equal to IWDA / EMIM. Unlike iShares, Vanguard only uses securities lending for efficient portfolio management. Note that these funds currently only are available at XETRA.


For those who are looking for small cap exposure it is possible to add **WSML** to your standard world exposure. This could for example be 75% IWDA, 10% IEMA and 15% IUSN. I personally do not recommend this as mixed small cap [does not capture the size factor in a good way](https://youtu.be/uErHwq4M6pg). Instead, it is only the value portion of small cap which are accountable for the outperformance of small cap stocks vs large cap stocks. If you want to capture the size factor into your portfolio you need to find small cap funds which only consist of value stocks. I've linked two accumulating funds above (ZPRV and ZPRX) which do so, however are very small and therefore have their own set of problems. Until a proper small cap value stock becomes available in Europe, it is perfectly fine to leave small caps out of your portfolio altogether.

This post was last updated: 5th of August 2020Hey! 

I'd love to hear where everybody is from!
I know DnB is pretty big in the UK and Belgium. Maybe some parts of the US and Australia?
Where are you from?

Optional: Also, how is the scene where you do live? How did you get into DnB? Any good artists who originate from (or near) your hometown?
I'm from Brussels, Belgium! 

EDIT: added the optional :-)Hey! 

This is a followup on my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/2nxhip/couchsurfer_stole_my_credit_card_information/) in which I told you about my experience with Kurt ""Jangala"" Dierickx. Here is the full story up until today. I was hesitant wether I should post this or not, but decided to post it after all because:

1. I've lost every trace of him by now. 

2. I've got my money back.

You will notice I have been extremely naive in some instances... I just hope this will help any of you by warning you.

_______________________________

Back in November, a guy contacted me on bewelcome.org . I was looking forward to hosting somebody for the first time, so I accepted his request even though there were some red flags which I didn't notice untill after the incident.


**17 - 19th of november - the stay**

He contacted me under the alias ""aboaussieproud"" where he posed as an Australian aboriginal traveling around the world for 7+ years. He sent a message using bewelcome asking to reply on another email adress. In hindsight this was red flag #1, but at the time I didn't really think about it too much as some websites don't work on mobile platforms too well. 

Now I'm not gonna tell you about him as a guest, because he was a normal guy. Yeah, okay, so my friends thought he was a bit weird, and maybe he was, but honestly, with some good will he would've been a perfect guest. He was friendly, cleaned up after him, he even cooked one night...

However, there were some weird things going on / stories he told you:

1. He told me he'd lost his wallet, so he didn't have any money or ID on him. I've been in the same situation more than I care to admit, so at the time this wasn't really an issue, but this was definitely red flag #2. I ended up paying for his stay - which was fine by me but ultimately ended with me making up som excuse for kicking him out of my house because I couldn't keep paying for him with my student budget.

2. He was really paranoid about not taking pictures of / with him. Again, I know some people who are really concerned about their privacy, but this was a MAJOR red flag; #3..

3. He told us some completely unrealistic BS stories of his world trip we didn't believe from the minute he told them, which was why we thought he was a bit weird sometimes..

4. He was able to speak flemish (= dutch with another accent). This really was the biggest red flag of all, and frankly I cannot even start to comprehend how I did not find this suspicious at all. He fed me some story about his mother being Belgian and his father Australian...  

**19 - 21th of november - the theft / fraud**

So we split up, I go on with my normal life. He ends up emailing me back the 20th asking if I could host him again, but I tell him I'm too busy. 

From this point and onward, everything I say is a guess, as I only have my credit card statements to support me.

Kurt takes a train to Amsterdam, where he uses my card (online) to book a room in the Amsterdam New West Inn in Osdorp. Additionally, he uses my card to pay for wifi two times at the Schiphol airport. He stole 450 euros from me utill he hit my limit. (I was ""lucky"" I had some other expenses that month so he couldn't spend more).

How did he get my creditcard information? He probably copied it while I was showering / cooking for him. He never stole anything else though, probably because it was either impossible or not of enough value. He couldn't steal my phone because that would be too suspicious.

**6th of december - now - the hunt**

For some reason, I didn't notice my card was maxed out before the 6th of december. At this point I take actions to ensure he could not spend more: I blocked my card, called to my bank and my credit card issuer. I went to the police but they told me they cannot help me because the money is still was my account (since he used a credit card he used my credit, not my actual money - yet). Eventually the police ends up helping me, but too late.

Back home I start looking for him on the internet. I found a lot of articles about him, so it became clear he has been doing this for a long time:

His [- fake? - twitter account.](https://twitter.com/aboaussieproud)

This [great post about him on Flickr.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/opspin/2339710821/)

Some other articles / posts about him:
[German article translated to english](http://wp1156764.server-he.de/english/writing_couch.html), [another article](http://www.opencouchsurfing.org/2008/02/17/a-call-for-disclosure/), [blog post](http://www.highexistence.com/topic/couchsurfing-thief-hits-occupy-amsterdam/), ...

Just look for him name ""Kurt"" and some terms like couchsurfing, bewelcome, HospitalityClub, thief or anything else and I'm sure you can find even more on this guy. 

So I start sending messages around to hosts in Amsterdam. Maybe he is still there? I also post [here, on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/2nxhip/couchsurfer_stole_my_credit_card_information/).. Who knows, maybe some of you know more? Finally, I go over to other sites like couchsurfing, HospitalityClub and global freeloaders and send some more messages. Kurt told me during his stay he was very active on the last website.. 

The same day I get answers from some people. Some who just want to thank me for the warning, some who want to help me find him or some who tell me they have been contacted by him. I get two messages here on reddit, both equally as interesting:

The first one from a guy who claims he has been contacted on global freeloaders by Kurt, and wants to help set up a trap. Another message by somebody who claims to have been ripped off by Kurt in the hotel in Amsterdam. Keep in mind, one or both of these messages could come from Kurt posing as somebody trying to help. 

Let's focus on these two: the first one claimed to have gotten a request by Kurt in Amsterdam to stay with him. Assuming this is legit, I knew he was still in Amsterdam back then. Now, I'm not going to tell you the whole story, but it ended with me trusting he wanted to help, and us trying to set up a trap. The problem was getting the police on board. By the time they wanted to help, Kurt was already gone. I was really really really close to catching Kurt, even though Kurt thought he was one step ahead of me because:

The second person who contacted me send me a message on reddit claiming he had been ripped off by Kurt in the hotel. However, from the beginning there were some red flags:

1. His reddit account /u/sdegdata is new and empty. Whoever he is made the account to contact me.

2. His email was the same as his reddit account.

3. His email was a neomailbox account. Take a look at their [website](https://www.neomailbox.com) and you'll understand why this is suspicious. 

4. During our conversation, around 7pm, he told me he was boarding a plane to NYC from Gatwick. First of all, most intercontinental planes flying west depart during the European morning, not evening. This may seem far-stretched but I assure you this was actually what made me suspicious in the first place. It was only afterwards I discovered all the other red flags in his story / profile. 

5. He provided a journal number for the Dutch police which was fake. 

6. His story made absolute no sense at all. This is a message from ""the victim"" to me, explaining what Kurt has done to him. Anybody could tell this story was BS:

>He approached me in the hotel that he was staying in on your card. The hotel 'verified' his story to me and I bought him a couple meals. He then claimed that his mother would wire me funds back and that I should send her wire information.  I did so, and received several emails from a person named Martine Theroux from Belgium and supposedly 'Kurt's' mother stating on several occasions that wire transfer was initiated to my account for large amounts and if I could put a reservation on Kurt's name and also give him some cash. The hotel verified his story, claiming to be in contact with his ""mother"". Ther wire never came and he ran up a huge bill on my cc. I had already left holland and was in uk for business. While in uk, hotel contacted me claiming that he left in middle of night and that they now think he is fraud (cos I believe you or your cc company called the hotel). Once I was notified,  I called amex. Amex immediately gave me the money back as the hotel was basically unwittingly made complicit in his crimes including the use of your card. Despite this, I got so pissed off by this person that I had to get him. Also, by reporting to the police, Amex was much easier about giving me all the money back.

Anyway, I messed with Kurt a bit, feeding him some false information while planning a trap with the other guy. Again, it was really unfortunate for us we didn't catch Kurt, because I cannot stress enough how CLOSE we were. Kurt thought he was safe because he thought I was telling him all my plans / everything I knew at the time. At the same time I actually had contact with another guy trying to set up a plan to catch Kurt. If it weren't for the dutch police being so slow we would've actually catched him. We were only one day too late.

**29th of december - I got my money back**

So after a long period of time I finally got my money back. I'm not sure who paid for it in the end, or even if it was my bank or credit card issuer who got it back for me, but thank you :). 

_______________________________

**What we know about him**

First of all, read [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/opspin/2339710821/). Here you'll find pictures of him.

I am sure his real name is Kurt Dierickx, and he is from Antwerp, Belgium. He's 29 - 31 years old. This information comes directly from the Dutch police (they shared it by mistake, so they'll deny everything). 

He's wanted in Denmark: Journal number 0109-75584-00197-08

He's wanted in the Netherlands: Journal number PL1500-2014315593-1 (= my journal number)

He's probably wanted in other parts of Europe or the world as well.

He was last spotted in Portugal.

He is / was active on couchsurfing, bewelcome, hospitality club and global freeloaders. Maybe more.


_______________________________

So why am I telling you all this? Well, first of all because I lost every trace of him by now. Secondly, to give you a warning. Thirdly, if you do find him, contact the police immediately. The police might not have anything to arrest him on at the spot, but once they cross-reference his name they'll see who he is and have enough to keep him for a while. If he doesn't have an ID on him, try giving his real name to the police.

Let's get started, shall we?

**PARTS**

* **CASE:** Xigmatek Asgard 381 ATX - $25 @ Amazon
* **CPU:** AMD Athlon II 750K - $78 @ Directron
* **COOLER:** Dynatron G950 - $12 @ Directron
* **RAM:** 8GB AMD Entertainment Edition DDR3-1333 - $35 @ NCIXUS
* **MOBO:** ECS A55F2-M3 mATX - $37 @ Amazon
* **PSU:** Corsair CX430M - $25 @ NewEgg
* **GPU:** Visiontek 6770 - $60 @ eBay
* **HDD:** 80GB Western Digital Velociraptor - $30 @ eBay
* **TOTAL:** $302

Now, I know you can tell there's a second HDD in the build and some cables. Neither were necessary, but I threw them in because I had them available. For those, you can consider:

* **CABLES:** Mod/Smart Kobra SS Extensions - $20 @ Amazon
* **HDD:** 500GB Western Digital Green - $40 @ eBay
* **TOTAL:** $362

The 750K is sitting at a comfortable 4.4 GHz OC with the CPU cooler running in ""Quiet"" mode via the motherboard. The RAM is running at 1333 (1x8GB). The 6770 has a mild overclock, bringing it up to 900/1310. Both the CPU and GPU are running fine and are completely stable.

**RESULTS**

I only really tested it on BF3. I left the settings on Auto and let BF3 decide where the card should be. You can see those settings [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/kSOSDgz.jpg). It's mostly on High, which is where I left it.

At 1600x900, the build performed amicably. I had no issue playing BF3 at those settings, averaging about 45 FPS in campaign. It never dipped below 35 FPS and spike as high as 57 FPS.

At 1920x1080, it was playable on those settings, but would have been a better experience either scaled slightly back, or after giving the GPU an OC with a voltage tweak. FPS averaged around 34, but would dip as low as 30. I only saw it drop below 30 and for a brief second after the screen filled with explosions. It spiked as high as 45 FPS. It was definitely playable, but the difference was notable coming from a system that kept it above 60 FPS at all times.

If you're on an extreme budget, it's completely do-able. I found myself very surprised by the build and its capabilities. I believe the extra money for a 7770 GHz Edition would have really set things off, however. I put this build together in about a week and all of the parts were essentially new. The PSU is the only component that had a MIR.

Now for what you're really after...

halibut_skies,2,5,"Bought a sealed BB to replace a Sugino Loose Bearing BB as it was creaking and the spindle was a bit long. Bought a Shimano UN55 unit from a LBS and after screwing in the main body and adapter, noticed that the non-drive side of the spindle was protruding noticeably more than the drive. Naturally, my chainrings are making contact with the chain stays. Am I missing something? I have been working/volunteering 5 days/week for ~4months at a community bike workshop and know my way around a wrench. Any ideas? Crankset is a double, but the way this looks now, even one ring wouldn't fit. Is there a piece I need to remove in order to properly install it? Definitely in the correct side. (Only one way it can go in. The main body goes in to the drive side, adapter to non-drive. 

Looking at photos of the unit have led me to believe that the piece I have is not defective. Hi r/bikewrench!

So here's the deal:  

I have been volunteering at a new community bike workshop (Biketopia - 1752 Alcatraz Adeline Berkeley, CA 94704) and this young feller has expressed interest in making one of these babies. I know nothing about it. He showed me some pictures and video online and they look insanely dangerous and altogether silly-as-F. But, I told him I would make his dreams come true and he smiled real wide so I feel obligated see this thing through. One of the other volunteers is going to work on it with me and the kid. We have a number of donated frames to choose from, but we do not want to do any welding of any kind. The shop is rather small and we want to keep this project as simple as possible. Ideally I'd like to make one of these upside-down bikes, utilizing one frame only. If anyone knows anything about these monstrosities and how to build one that is relatively safe to ride and a hassle-free build, I'm all ears.

ThanksSo I just finished building an old English club racer and built up some affordable, but adequate wheels. CR-18s (single eyelets, MSW) laced to vintage high-end Shimano 8-speed hubs, using Sapim 2.0/1.8 spokes. The rims were inexpensive but I assumed, having used Rhyno Lites on my 29er in the past, that they should be quite formidable for mere road use. What I've experienced begs to differ. 

I wanted modern dual pivot brakes on the bike so the mounting holes needed drilling to accomodate the recessed bolt used on most calipers. It was daunting but in the end, accomplished successfully. Mated to the calipers are Kool Stop cartridge pads, the black/salmon/black type. Here is where I believe the problem stems... 

A couple days ago I was showing off the build to a coworker and he said my brakes needed aligning. I thought he was being a dick, but low and behold, the wheel wasn't centered. Upon further inspection, the calipers are centered, but the wheel is out of true. How could this be? I've literally ridden the bike/wheels 50 miles max. I put the rear wheel in the stand (rear was way worse than front) and find that, in addition to being out of true by maybe 1cm (left to right), that some of the tensions, non-drive specifically, are dangerously low. Below 10 Park Units. Yipes. I know I built the wheel to optimal tension, balanced partner spokes, de-stressed, all of that. So I figure it might have something to do with the brake pad material mated to the rather vicious machining of the CR-18 sidewall. I true the wheel, put it on the bike, ride the 3 miles back home (with only a smidge of braking along the way) and again, the wheel is out of true. Not as bad as previously, but such is to be expected given the minimal time in the saddle since truing. 

So I guess my question is, are CR-18s garbage? Or am I using the wrong pad/rim combo. I can try some harder pads, but wanted the internet's input. Incase you were wondering, I am approx. 200lbs riding, but tall, so it's spread out across the bike. So I'm having an issue with my latest road build. I am running 53/39 cranks with 11-28t cassette and a Shimano 6401 RD (8 speed, 28t max). The chain is not ideally as long as it should be. I have about a link overlap. An extra full link is making for some nasty rubbing of the chain on the RD's knuckle in any of the smaller cogs (using 39 up front). And I mean long before cross chaining. Because of this, I have been running the chain length I've got now. I bought a half link but can't seem to put it on with the powerlink (KMC) because the half link is ramped and wont allow flat contact to put the powerlink together. Is there some trick to doing this? Can I not use a 7/8 speed half link with the power link? 

The reason I need this link is that when shifted into the largest cog (28t), the pulley is too close for comfort. No where near the recommended 6mm. As a result, the chain slips under heavy torque application. 

I have a feeling the whole issue would be sorted if I used a RD with a longer cage, but damnit, I really want to solve the issue before resorting to that. I feel like this derailleur was put on bikes that had maybe 25t max. 28t would have been on a mountain bike at the time. 

Any ideas?These two fantastic road bikes are being sold in the East Bay, California. Here are the craigslist ads:

Just so to see the whole sub being drown in the reign of fire.So after the appearance of the... confusing poster (I was flabbergasted when I first saw that), I got some idea about the plot of the segment.

The plot starts when somehow Tom got a picture of 'Princess' Marco, and he is... interested in this girl. Thus, he seeks Marco for help (maybe he dont want to meet his ex) , and the shenanigan begin.  Marco have to become the matchmaker and the Princess. 

This is just my thought, so it may not happen in the show. I'm currently finding a good DE to use, and I see XFCE is pretty lightweight. So 'm about o customize a bit. But when i first change a theme (Arc Dark) icons on the Desktop look very odd. The text words have shadow and out of center.

CaptainJamie,7,5,"In this post I'm going explain how to rank dental clinics on Google. I've learned a lot from the people here and I've tried my best to give advice where I can to other members, so I thought I'd create some content to help other SEOs with their client work and regular business owners who don't have the budget to hire a professional but still want to improve their rankings on Google.

That being said, I thought it would be good to make a series of guides based on real website examples - I'll pick a real website that isn't performing well on Google, figure out what they're doing wrong and provide insight on what they need to be doing to grow their business using SEO. For this example, we're going to tackle a local dental client. I've simply picked a random location with a random website that isn't doing well organically.

**Target Location:** San Jose, California  
**Business Category:** Dental  
**Business Name:** Quality Dental Care SJ  
**Software/Services Used:** Ahrefs, Screaming Frog, Surfer Local

# Current SEO Audit

The first thing I'd do is perform a quick audit on the current setup. This is local SEO so we need to be looking at local searches and GMB (Google My Business). GMB is very important for local businesses, when a potential customer types in terms like ""family dentist"", above the organic search results local businesses will appear in the ""map pack"", which is a map with 3 featured businesses, with shows relevant business information such as opening times, reviews and contact details, as well as buttons to call the business or visit their website.

**GMB Listing**

I'm using Surfer Local to perform a grid search for keywords related to the business. What Surfer Local does is simulates a search in the service area of the business in many spots to fetch the ranking for the business. The results are displayed as a grid - each small circle contains the current ranking in that area and the radius around the circle is depended on the difficulty of improving the situation (green = easy, orange = medium, red = hard). What we want is a ranking between #1-3, which would place us in the map pack for that search result.

The way to rank well in GMB is by filling out all the information you can, collect regular reviews from customers, create regular GMB posts with relevant updates and create local citations. However, one of the #1 ranking factors is the location of the business - the closer you are to the searcher, the better chance of showing.

Here's the results of my local search for ""dentist"" in the area around the clinic.

In the direct area around the clinic itself they rank #1 and #3 for the keyword. Further than that, there's a lot of room for improvement. In Surer Local we can run an ""Audit"" on every circle that appears in the results. This audit will take into account competitor listings and provide you with suggestions to outrank them.

After I ran an audit on the circles, several few issues were spotted:

* The business description is missing.
* There are no GMB posts.
* A lot of time between reviews (and lack of responses to reviews)
* Secondary categories are missing which could be added.

**Current Local Citations**

The second thing I did was run a search on Moz Local's listing checker. This tool allows you to search for a business and it'll check socials, directories & GNV for your listing and check for NAP consistency. NAP, which stands for Name, Address, Phone Number, is very important for local SEO. You need to make sure every single mention of your business across the web is consistent with NAP - if you have any of it different, Google may not make the connection. When you create these mentions on the web, they are called local citations.

Here's the results of the scan I ran:

[https://imgur.com/OfasEsY](https://imgur.com/OfasEsY)

Not very good. 54% of sites searched don't have a listing for the business, 42% have a listing but they are inconsistent (name, address or phone number may be different or formatted different) and only 4% correct.

Overall, a lot to be improved there.

**Website**

The website itself is fine. A website does not need to be a work of art to rank, it just needs to have decent internal linking, a good amount of quality content (with keyword research in mind), be relatively fast and have some authority (through backlinks).

Some problems with the current website:

* Keyword research needs done
* Page speed could be improved
* Content is a thin on pages
* Page titles/h1 tags/alt text could be optimized

I ran the website through Screaming Frog, which is a tool that crawls websites and returns a lot of useful information like the indexability of pages, the crawl depth, the amount of words on the pages, along with h1/h2/h3 tags etc, the schema on pages as well as a lot more.

From the scan, there aren't any glaring issues. If you check the right side of the tool and click the ""Structure"" tab, there's a window called ""Crawl Depth"" just below it. This is how many clicks a visitor needs to get to all the pages on the site, the higher the number, the more effort the Google crawler needs to find the content on your site. You only have a limited crawl budget, so this is important to get right. I recommend requiring no more than 3 clicks to get to every page on your site. This can be achieved by having good internal linking, either through a main navigation menu that links to the majority of your pages, or at least linking to parent pages like ""Treatments"" and on that main page linking to the internal treatment pages.

**Backlinks & Authority**

If you want to rank well on Google then you want to make sure you have a good backlink profile. If you have solid backlinks from local directories, local news websites, industry specific sites and in general higher authority sites than you, this is passing authority to your website. For this, quality is better than quantity - if you buy 1000 links from fiverr, you're not going to see any positive impact. One good link is worth more than 10,000 bad ones.

Dofollow links are what matter the most here (although having a mixture between nofollow and dofollow is recommended) as they are the links that authority will flow through.

It's also worth mentioning that you should focus on referring domains when analysis the current link profile, not the total # of backlinks. If a website links to you more than once it's not going to improve much further, the goal is the total number of quality sites linking to you rather than getting multiple from the same site.

In Ahrefs ""Site Explorer"" the website has a domain rank of 0 and 23 total referring domains. Only 4 of them are dofollow and 2 are useless & spammy. The remaining 2 are directory links.

# SEO Work

**Step 1: Keyword Research**

The first step is actually coming up with a plan of keywords, or search terms, that we want to target. Having a site that's beautiful and optimized is great, but if it's focusing on keywords that don't get any traffic then it's all for nothing.

The way I start keyword research is to search ""dentist \[city name\]"", make note of top results and run them through site explorer to see the keywords they rank for. In this case, I searched ""dentist san jose ca"" and made note of the first page results and ran them through the site explorer tool to look at their keywords.

**From that, I came out with the following keywords:**  
""dentist san jose"" - 400 searches per month  
""dentist in san jose"" - 150 searches per month  
""dentist san jose ca"" - 70 searches per month  
""family dentist san jose"" - 20 searches per month  
""san jose dental implant"" - 50 searches per month  
""dental implants san jose ca"" - 80 searches per month  
""dental implants san jose"" - 60 searches per month  
""cosmetic dentist san jose"" - 100 searches per month  
""san jose cosmetic dentistry"" - 70 searches per month  
""teeth cleaning san jose"" - 200 searches per month  
""veneers san jose"" - 20 searches per month  
""emergency dentist san jose"" - 100 searches per month  
""teeth whitening san jose"" - 200 searches per month  
""tooth whitening san jose"" - 150 searches per month  
""braces san jose"" - 40 searches per month

A lot of the tools are usually conservative with their estimates - I find the real number is usually higher. You'll also find that some low volume keywords might not have much data available.

Some of these keywords will be secondary keywords, in that you'll mention them in the website content, either within paragraphs, alt text or heading tags, but the main keyword is what you'll use in the page title and h1.

Also, please look at the search results for these keywords and check the search intent before targeting them. The keyword ""best dentist san jose"" gets 350 searches per month but every result is a ""Top 10 Dentists in San Jose"" type page - you aren't going to rank for that.

**Step 2: On-Page SEO**

Now that we have keywords to target, now we need to make use of them. A good way to do this is create a list of pages on your website, assign keywords to them and decide the page title, headings and content that needs optimized. This includes word count. The best way to decide the word count and other on-page elements like h1 and alt tags is to search for your target keyword, visit the top 5 results and check what they have. This is what google is currently rewarding, so try and follow those guidelines.

If you don't want to do this manually, you can use Screaming Frog to do some of the leg work for you, as it can grab all the different h1-h6 tags, as well as word count on each page and other details.    
    
I want to make this very clear: You NEED to be writing high-quality content. Don't write 200 words and call it a day, and don't hire someone for $5 to write 1000 words of keyword stuffed rubbish.

You'd want to achieve the following on all pages:

* Main target keyword in the page title, along with included in the page content, h1 tags and alt image text, IF the top competition is doing it. For example, if the top 5 competitors for a keyword are NOT including the exact keyword phrase in the h1 tag, then you probably shouldn't either.
* Quality content, no keyword stuffing in unnatural places and an overall word count that's close to what the current search result pages
* Answer popular questions in FAQ - If you google your keyword, you'll find a ""People also ask"" box in the search results. These are perfect for giving Google what it wants. Grab these questions and answer them FAQ style somewhere on the page - if you're lucky, Google will use your site in the featured snippet and you'll get a bunch of extra traffic.

Here's some examples of what we could do:

**Homepage**  
Keywords: ""dentist san jose"", ""dentist in san jose"", ""family dentist san jose"", ""best dentist san jose""  
Page title: ""Family Dentist in San Jose | Quality Dental Care""  
h1: ""We're the Best Family Dentist in San Jose""  
Word count: 1395

**Treatment Parent Page (/cosmetic-treatments)**

Keywords: ""cosmetic dentist san jose"", ""san jose cosmetic dentistry""  
Page title: ""Cosmetic Dentist San Jose | Quality Dental Care""  
h1: ""Cosmetic Dentistry""   
Word count: 1423

**Treatment Child Page (/treatments/dental-implants/)**

Keywords: ""dental implants san jose ca"", ""dental implants san jose""  
Page title: ""Dental Implants San Jose CA | Quality Dental Care""  
h1: ""Dental Implants""  
Word count: 1524    
    
These are examples, but you can mix it up. You need to look at what the competition are doing and  realise that even if your on-page is perfect, if you don't have a solid backlink profile then it's going to be difficult to rank high in competitive markets.  

A must for local SEO is to implement local business structured data. This is a snippet of code that includes information about your business, the type of business, the opening hours, your social links and a whole bunch of other stuff. Including this on your site can help your rankings, especially in GMB. If you google ""local business schema generator"" there's a bunch of sites that can help you create this, with instructions to put it on your site.

**Step 3: Backlinks**

Having good, optimized content is great, and sure, you might reach the front page for low competitive search terms without them, but longer term, and by targeting competitive keywords (that bring more $$$), you're going to need to get backlinks.

Here's what I do to build a good backlink profile:

* **Create local citations** \- These are mentions of your NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) on directory listings. They are mostly nofollow, but they are absolutely needed for local SEO and Google My Business - plus, you need a backlink profile that's diverse. You can use a service like ""SEO Builder"" to build these for you or do it manually. The more local, the better. The more relevant, the better. Make sure you mix up your business description or the link won't get indexed.
* **Use HARO** \- HARO is ""Help a reporter out"" and it connects reporters looking for information with specialists willing to provide it in exchange for a link back to their site. You get 3 emails per day with a list of opportunities - I'd ctrl + f and search for ""dental"" and other related keywords, then reach out. You can get featured on high authority domains this way with minimal effort.
* **Start a blog** \- Not only is this a great way to get traffic on your site from long tail keywords, but websites in your industry are willing to link back to resources that provide value. It's going to be difficult getting high authority sites to link to a dental service page that doesn't offer anything.
* **Guest blogging** \- Reach out to industry related blogs and pitch an article that would provide value for them. They're usually happy to provide a link back, either in the article, or at the end in the author bio box. The best links you can get are from higher authority sites that don't just accept guest posts from everyone.
* **Reverse engineer backlinks** \- Use ahrefs to pull your competitors backlink profile - sort by dofollow and make a list. These sites were willing to link to them, so perhaps they'd do the same for you. What you'll find is the majority are directory links, but if it's working for them, then you might as well get a link from the same site.
* **Sponsor a local business/event -** This one is common in the law industry. Reach out to events and offer to be a sponsor. You'll pay for this, but a link from a local business is a big deal for local SEO, so it's usually going to be worth it.   

  
Should I build backlinks to my homepage or service pages? Both. If you have very low authority, you should prioritise building to your home page for a few months, but beyond that, a 50/50 split is ideal. Prioritise keywords with decent search volume that are quick wins. For keywords like ""dentist san jose"" it's usally the homepage people are trying to rank the term for, so naturally they'll have the most backlinks and therefore harder to rank. But for inner pages, what you'll find is there is a lot of opportunities.

Take the keyword ""emergency dentist san jose"" for instance. It has 100 searches per month - but look at the top 10 results:

[https://imgur.com/jm7Fq7k](https://imgur.com/jm7Fq7k)

All the front page results are inner pages (i.e not the homepage) and the majority of them don't have any backlinks pointing to them. In this case, these aren't even high authority sites either and the backlinks some of the pages do have are nofollow spammy links, which means they have zero value.

If you build 1 or 2 good dofollow links to your own page targeting that keyword then you're pretty much guaranteed first page ranking.

# Conclusion

SEO takes time and effort. If you give Google what it wants, you'll be rewarded for it. Will implementing these changes put you on the first page overnight? Well, it's possible, but realistically, SEO results usually take a while. If you do everything right, eventually you'll see the results though.

If you saw value in what I wrote above and want me to do the same for other industries, please let me know. Any questions I'll answer in the comments too.This one is really weird. Here's the original discussion about the murders:

Since then a prime suspect from 50 years ago has decided to comment on an article discussing the crimes, defending himself with friends and neighbours of the family. It appears he was known for being creepy, and had been accused of molesting the Sims daughter. It's an interesting read and I don't know why he bothered to come out after all this time and post this creepy shit that doesn't make him look very good. The suspect is ""Vernon Fox"" in the comments."

jonmcfluffy,6,2,"an example would be an anti hydrogen (so guess negative proton right?) and a matter gold atom.my friends have seen me playing Planetside 2 on steam for a while now and they are interested in playing, and try to play with me. we all know that playing in a small squad isnt really fun if you dont have good leadership, as you dont know where to go.

as a somewhat noob player i join a platoon and its all good, however its harder to get my friends to join the same platoon as they become full or my specific squad is full and now me and my friend arnt playing together as in he cant see me as well/ dont know where i am, and telling him to find a green circle with a 6 in it is honestly starting to seem too much of a hassle.

**So what do I propose?** a smaller squad, maybe a cell of some sort that sticks together, can be a different color all together while in this cell and also if by chance one of your members gets kicked, the entire cell is also kicked. it would also be that if one person is moved from a squad you all follow to the new squad, a simple box outlining and grouping should suffice for platoon leaders to be able to tell how many they have in the cell, as well as a new platoon/squad options to not allow cells if they cant be bothered.

I would think this could also help with the new mentor stuff daybreak wants to implement, as you would be directly helping a new player out, in this case my friends who want to play but cant because planetside 2 has a big ui/spawning learning curve.just wondering how people react to the idea, from playing final fantasy 14: a realm reborn, i find that it worked out quite well with their duel platform system they have going. it brings them in another audience that might not have had.

but i also realize the draw back of having to hold back or not implement content into the game because of console limitations, esp present in rpgs on the console.


should we welcome our console brothers or say nay?so i first started playing planetside 2 around 2 years ago, i think the game had just released then as i remember not being able to buy the alpha founder pack by 3 months. however i haven't played all those 2 years, probably about 2 months at the start, then spotted times summing up to around another 2 months, 417 hours total on steam.

being gone this long makes me wonder just what was so bad about the game during then? can only really remember being the performance and sub par fps people would get, but disregarding those why has certain elements changed?

**1st** why has cap points gone from ""you must have 2,2,2 or 6 people on the cap at all times for it to cap"" to ""touch it and leave"" this seems like it would at least draw 6 people from camping the spawn room all the time, actually preventing spawn camping somewhat, yet they changed it so that there is no real objective real reason to be there.

**2nd**, which i need opinions from the vets cause i don't remember the problems with it, why put in this line system? it doesn't make sense at all and makes for one hell of a unstoppable zerg, atleast before you could take a squad and flank cap them with gal pulling and droping to get up where the roads didnt take you.

**3rd** why is Indar locked out 90% of the time? i get that people were playing on Indar 90% of the time so it was kinda boring, but lets face it, Indar is the only continent that isnt 100% one thing. it has desert, canyons, and grassy fields. Esamir is all snow, aramish is mountain hell, and hossin is all swamp. fighting on anything besides indar makes me want to get a change of scenery because its all the same.

**4th**, this resource system is *strange*, its not really a finite resource. i can pull almost anything anytime, and as long as i dont drive straight into the enemy team, i live long enough to pull another one, especially when looking at a max suit. i was playing yesterday and we pushed them back off of the point and then we pushed onto the next base pushing them back. i needed a ride to the next base as before i would value this max suit, i was going to get another one anytime soon... but i looked down and i was capped on resources, so i just ditched it like a dirty sock and got a new one at the base i needed to be at. this system allows us to pull and pull with little to no penalty. it doesnt even matter how well your faction does with territory control either, because the resource generation is based on the number of warp gates you own, which should be always 3-4 right?

**5th**, i can see the lib nerfs cause they were kinda everywhere but they were also fun to shoot down with an anti air squad.

**6th**, i know this is a touchy subject but the cosmetice overrides are getting a little out of hand, i almost want an option to turn some of them off, one in particular is a voice over (idk if it is just on the vs side) that makes way harder to hear what they are calling out, it sounds like a mechanical robot ghost. i could *not* care less about people getting different hats or camos that turn you into a rainbow max, if anything it draws fire off of the engis and medics following you.

**7th**, there is numerous other little things like max droping with the drop pods and other things i cant think of but are probably there.


**TL:DR**
so is there some huge thing i am missing that makes gu1 a horrible build and we are better where we are now? was there no counter play to the flank capping to disrupt the zerg guilds pushing?

if somehow it was better back then but too late now to revert it back, i want to start the movement (if it hasn't already) or atleast throw out the idea to **open a new server set to game update launch**, it would probably need to be a new client tbh.because that way no one can hide anything bigger than a small pistol and everyone will be safer.so me and my friend has just downloaded trove and are enjoying it, and for the first hour or so before he had to go it was fine.

about 3 hours later he can no longer play due to 10 second lag spikes that teleport him. his teamspeak connection is fine as i can still talk to him normally.

while he is in this lag phase his character runs in a straight line, almost like he was holding down the button for the duration.

his class is a lvl 4-5 gunslinger, and has the stormy mount.

if you need anymore help or have useful links please comment.do you continue to collect the specific class sparks after its filled and if you...

if you did is there any other use for them or are they being wasted?

if you did not do you have premium and are unable to collect sparks of evolution?

also can you confirm if you unlocked another 2 symbols? i heard each class atlas unlocks another 2, but didnt see many people say they did or didnt in other posts. if anyone has maxed a 2nd class, do you get *another* 2 symbols bringing up the number to 7?

i know this is a lot of questions but their answers would help me greatly! thank you."

Krystalraev,6,9,"I live in South Florida and bought a beef knuckle from the local Publix where there's an entire rack of bones for your dogs. I've bought bones off this rack in the past and had no real issues until three days ago. I gave my dog his bone, he chews it and spits most of it out (all over his bed- the same way he destroys his toys).

My dog started whining that night, so I brought him to the vet, told her about the bone, they do x-rays and see bone particles throughout his stomach. They hydrate him and see if he passes them. 2 x-rays and a day later, he needed emergency surgery for a total blockage in his bowel. Apparently the bone fragments calcify and seal into a sharp, concrete like substance with the stomach acids. Sometimes they pass them (my dog had passed some of it at the vet) and the vet still has him- 4 days later. 

I am now about $4k in vet bills over a product marketed for pets with absolutely no warning labels. 

Do I have a case? And how do I proceed with it? This is my first time on RedditGifts, so I had no idea what I'd get as far as what kind of person I'd be matched up with, but what an absolutely amazing experience! I got the most appreciative kid in the world! He's a lot like me actually so I got him some practical things and then I went back and read about what his likes/favorite authors/bucket list were and he wanted to travel the world and skydive. I can't afford to send him traveling, but I've been skydiving twice so I figure that it would be easy enough to find a way for him to do it (Groupon!). He lives nowhere near me so I had to email the voucher to him (today) and he was SO excited! It's really heartwarming to give to people who are so appreciative. I really can't wait for him to get the practical stuff (life changing in my opinion)! Has anyone else had any great experiences with this yet? Apparently I'm a little more difficult for my Secret Santa... I just added my Amazon list. "

Rshackleford22,2,5,"This makes it extremely unlikely the Cubs don't finish in the top 2 of the Central this season. 

Brewers only have 20 games left, so half of those vs the Cards. Cards 25 games left. Just not enough games left in the season for both of them to go on the runs they need to finish 1 and 2 in the Central. 

Cubs realistically only need a handful of wins here to end the year to lock up top 2. Obviously we want the Central title to get home field, but it would take the most unlikely of scenarios to not finish top 2 in the Central.

Imagine worst case scenario where the Cards and Brewers win out the rest of their games and split their 10. That would put the Brewers at 33-27 and Cards at 38-22. Obviously this isn't going to happen, but in this scenario Cubs would need to finish 9-8 to get 34 wins."

M27, 90kg (198lbs), 188cm (6'2)

Been doing ICF 5x5 for a past few months. No experience before that.
September - general fucking around the gym, weight - 82kg
October - chose to do ICF 5x5, but fucked around
November 12th - started tracking weights, progressing and stuff.

Really need your advice on squats and deadlifts. My bench only recently started to slow down, but I feel like I will still make good progress for a few months, while I can't seem to get the hang of squats and deadlifts.

Current working weights:

- High bar squat - 80kg (176lbs) 5x5
- Deadlift - 100kg (220lbs) 1x5
- OHP - 46kg (101lbs) 5x5
- Bench press - 82.5kg (181lbs) 5x5
- Bent over row - 65kg (143lbs) 5x5 (been doing them with a 45 degree bend, but watched Allan Thral's video and realized I must pickup the bar from the ground, instead of a height between my knee and hip, and keep my back parallel to the ground. I was doing 80kg with 45 degree angle)

Squats and deadlifts are the first things in the video, but also would be great to know if I'm doing the OHP and bent over row correctly.

Would apreciate your helpHey guys, 

I'm in need of your help. I've bought a used pc from a friend. Specs are as follows:

- Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600
- 4 x 1GB RAM
- GTX 560
- SSD and a HDD
- Energon EPS-750W PSU
- ASUS OEM P5E mobo
- Some pretty big and sturdy case
- BluRay drive
- $230 for all of it;

I was thinking that GPU (GTX 560) is quite OK for gaming. I won't get high on new games, but older ones would be pretty good.
SSD and HDD are also ok and enough for me. PSU seems adequate.

Current bottleneck on this rig is definitely CPU and RAM. 

For RAM I'm thinking these: [Crucial Sport 8GB Kit \(4GBx2\), Ballistix DIMM, DDR3 PC3-12800](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucial-BLS2CP4G3D1609DS1S00CEU-Ballistix-240-pin-PC3-12800/dp/B006YG94Y2/?tag=logicaincre05-21) 

For new Mother Board - [Gigabyte Z87X-UD3H](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gigabyte-Motherboard-4th-Generation-Intel-Core-Processors/dp/B00CXK59QK/?tag=logicaincre05-21)(current one's socket doesn't support new CPUs)

New CPU - [Intel Core i5 4670K Quad Core](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Intel-Graphics-BX80646I74770-Generation-Technology/dp/B00CV3E3UC/?tag=logicaincre05-21) 

This is probably an overkill for the current GPU? I'm just considering that I'll move my video editing stuff from my current DELL XPS laptop onto this desktop. And after a year I will probably buy a new GPU and stuff that I want to buy now will probably still hold up then? And how about HSF? Do I need it with Intel Core i5 4670K? My room is not ventilated and PC stands like 20cm from a radiator.

Thanks!I remember watching an episode of MythBusters, where they acknowledged, that Adam made a mistake by saying:

""When two cars hit each other at 60 mph, it's like hitting a wall at 120 mph""

They did an experiment, and it turns out, that both cars only suffered as much damage as hitting a wall at 60 mph. They also proved it by some sorts of equation.

So my question is:

What happens, when one car is going, say, 100 mph and the other is going at say 20 mph and they hit each other head on? As you can't create additional energy, this means, that they have to ""share"" the same 120 mph. So how much damage (LHAWA - ""like hitting a wall at"") does each car take?

EDIT: I also think it's a very common misconception, I heard a lot of people saying that when you collide at some speed, it's the same as hitting a wall at 2x the speed)[removed]"

techmattr,4,8,"Yesterday I found an issue that has been haunting me for 7 years. Back in 2014 I built a new workstation for gaming/photo editing. It was a i7-4790K/ASUS Sabertooth Z97 Mark S in all white with custom cables. 

So... I've been sleeving my own PC cables since the 90's and never run into an issue. However in this build (I'm guessing) my custom cables for the AX760i had a bad connection somewhere and damages the PSU. I came to this conclusion because I used the PSU for about a year with no issues. Swapped it into this new build with the custom cables and at first had no issues.

After a month or so I'd start getting random reboots and blue screens under load. I thought it was overclocking settings... figured it was the motherboard... went through several motherboards, CPUs, RAM... went through several new builds all the way through Intel 9th Gen with this same PSU and custom cables.... every once in a while I would see small stability issues here and there.

Yesterday I built a ""new"" i5-9600K/Z370 and it would get through the Windows installation without issue but was randomly blue screening just opening a browser or blue screening right when it got to the login screen. 

Sitting there after the 100th blue screen I turned slowly and looked right at the custom cables and said to myself... son of bitch. This is the probably the first time in 7 years I replaced every piece of hardware at once with exception of the PSU.

ZeAthenA714,9,10,"Hi everyone!

As someone who plays a lot of RH, I see many people who complain about him. While I think some of those complaints are fair and level-headed, I also think some of those complaints are not warranted. One example is the fact that many people claim that RH doesn't have any counter. I disagree with that idea, and that's why I want to write a guide to show you how you can counter RH. I've seen my fair share of games where I was completely useless because the enemy team countered me properly, forcing me to switch. So believe me, it can happen.

I'm not writing this to try and defend RH, or try to convince you that he is perfectly balanced, or that by following this guide you'll never get killed by RH again. You have your opinion about him, and that's fine, I just want to give you tips to play better against him and avoid the mistakes I've seen people do so often in game.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not a pro RH player, I've been playing for a couple of months and have only reached high-plat so far. Still I know there's a lot of things people can do to do reduce RH's effectiveness, and I don't often see it in-game.

## General tips

Let's start with some general fundamentals that you need to know and understand, and we'll move on to practical applications of those after.

**Teamplay**

Overwatch is a team-based shooter, it's not rock-paper-scissor. Like many other heroes, RH doesn't have a hard counter that you can pick and expect to win every time. Some picks are better than others, but your first and best line of defense against RH is proper team play and communication. This is why he can be so devastating in lower ranks, where team play can be spotty. However no matter which hero you pick, you can still play a role in countering RH.

**Positioning, positioning, positioning**

RH is a punisher. If you make a mistake, he WILL capitalize on it. Perfecting your positioning will reduce RH's effectiveness immensely. When you get hooked, see this as a learning opportunity. Watch the killcam and ask yourself: what could you have done to prevent that from happening? In many situations there are little positioning tweaks you can do to avoid those deaths.

**Roadhog can flank**

RH can be useful either in the frontline safe behind a rein's shield, or flanking trying to kill your backline. Consider him like a reaper: you need to know where he is. If he gets the jump on you, you're dead. If he's not on the frontline, you're probably gonna get flanked, so watch out and warn your teammates. If you see him take a flanking route, call it out and adjust your position accordingly. Communication is key to stop his flanking abilities.

**Roadhog == hook**

RH's strength is his hook combo. Outside of that, the rest of his kit is pretty useless in most situation. RH will play on a loop: hook then try to stay safe for 6 seconds. Use that. If you see a hook, you know you can take more risks with positioning for 6 seconds. RH is also an easy target to burst down in that situation, and you get a ton of ult charge by shooting at him. A flanking RH that misses his hook is very vulnerable, you can easily corner him with 1 or 2 heroes to punish him, either by killing him or forcing him to retreat and waste time. But most importantly: you don't have to kill RH to counter him. Denying him hook opportunities is enough to neuter him.

**Run, don't die**

RH is very good at 1v1 against most heroes. That's okay. In many cases you don't have to fight him, you can simply retreat back to your team. If you're not 100% sure that you can kill RH in a duel, don't try. By fleeing you'll stay alive and RH will have wasted a ton of time.

**Roadhog is a lot less tougher than he looks**

RH might seem impressive with his 600hp + 300 self-heal, but he's actually quite easy to kill if he's in the open. He has no damage protection whatsoever, no movement abilities and a huge hitbox with plenty of head to shoot at. With focused fire he can be killed in a matter of 2 seconds. DPS (Soldier, Reaper, Tracer, Genji, Mccree) are really good for that. Damage dealing tanks are too. D.va, Zarya, Symm and even Zen can make a huge dent in his healthpool quickly enough to kill him. Snipers should never fear a hook, so they can safely burn him down. And finally, a zen discord basically makes him 360hp, and he becomes a very easy target to kill. So if you're facing a particularly pesky RH, coordinate with your teammates to make it a priority to bring him down.

So now that that's out of the way, let's get down to brass tack and see how to play against a roadhog. There's basically three things you can do against his hook combo: prevention, interruption, punishment.

## Prevention

Keep in mind: RH's hook travel in a straight line. You need to keep RH in check and know his position at all times. The gist of it is to think of RH like he's Widowmaker: you don't want to be in his LOS, otherwise you're in danger.

**Use shields**

The best and safest way to avoid RH's hook is to stay behind a shield. Basically Rein's shield, Winston's shield, Symmetra's shield or a teammate with a Zarya bubble. If one of those is between you and RH, you're safe. Use them as much as possible.

**Use scenery**

Pretty much every part of the scenery will stop RH's hook. That's especially useful if he's flanking and you're far from your shields, there's a lot of stuff you can hide behind. Many chokepoints are filled with opportunities to break LOS with RH.

**Use your tanks**

If the shields are down, you can still hide behind your teammates, especially tanks with their huge hitbox. RH cannot hook *through* someone, if there's a Rein or D.va between you and RH, his hook will catch your teammate and not you. Be a coward.

**Stay outside of his range**

This is especially useful for healers. You can stay far from the frontline and still be able to heal. So don't get too close to the battlefield if there's a RH in the enemy team. If you know RH is flanking on your right, go left. In many situation you can still be useful while staying far from RH.

**Use escape abilities**

This is in combination with the previous point: at max range RH's hook will take a full second to reach you. Plenty of time to use an escape ability if you have good reflexes and avoid a death. When playing against a RH try to keep your escape abilities for those situation, it can literally be the difference between life and death.

## Interruption

If unfortunately you get hooked, you're fucked. There's absolutely nothing you can do yourself to avoid eating a shotgun blast to the face. Your teammates however can break the hook combo. So when you're playing against RH, watch out for your teammates getting hooked, you can often save them.

**Zarya bubble**

This is probably the best counter to a hook combo: if you bubble your teammate, he will survive the shotgun blast and you'll get some free energy. When playing against a RH, try to keep your bubble just for those occasions, and you'll render him useless. The longer cooldown on your bubble is often meaningless, because most of the time (if you apply the tips in this guide) RH won't get a hook opportunity every 6 seconds. So you can definitely save your teammates consistently.

**Mei wall**

Another strong counter to the hook combo, if you put up a wall between RH and his target, it will break the hook, saving your teammate. Abuse it.

**Ana's sleepdart**

RH is a perfect target when he's hooking someone because he's big. If you sleep him when he hook someone, your teammate will be saved and can capitalize on it.

**Mccree's flashbang**

The short range of mccree's flashbang means it's not easy to do, but if you stun RH it will break the combo. It's risky, but definitely possible.

**D.va's defense matrix (soon)**

It's not live yet, but D.va's defense matrix will be able to stop the shotgun blast if you use it properly. I haven't tried it yet, but basically you need to make sure your teammate is in your defense matrix when he lands on RH's feet.

**Lucio's boop, Junkrat's mine, Pharah's concussive blast**

Any ability that can pushback RH will prevent or mitigate the shotgun blast. Pharah's blast is the easiest to pull off, Junkrat's mine need a bit of anticipation to time it correctly, Lucio's boop is the most risky, but who doesn't love to jump into the enemy team to boop a RH?

**Last tip against bad RH players**

To pull off the hook combo perfectly, RH has to hold left click once the target is hooked. I still see many RH, even in platinum, not do this. That means you have one opportunity to use an ability and escape the shotgun blast. So at low ranks, spam that escape ability (Mei's iceblock, Pharah's jump, Reaper's wraith, Soldier's helix rocket, Lucio's boop etc...) on the off-chance the RH you're facing is bad.

## Punishment

Despite all those tips above, you will die to RH. It happens. But keep in mind that during a hook combo RH won't move much, and he's usually in the open. So he's a pretty easy target to burst down. If all else fail, focus your fire on RH when he's pulling off a hook combo and in many occasions you can trade. It might not be a fair trade, but it's better than nothing.

## 1V1

RH can be very threatening when he's flanking and he catches you alone. He's a strong dueler against most heroes, and very few people have a chance to kill him alone. Fortunately he doesn't have any movement abilities, which means a lot of heroes can actually escape a duel situation to retreat back to their team or stay outside of his hook range. In this section I'll give you specifics about how to handle a 1v1 situation with every hero in the case you can't outrange his hook and you have to play around it. Keep in mind I don't have enough experience with every hero to give you the perfect tips, I'll just tell you what can prevent me from winning a duel. This is also assuming full health, every abilities available, even skill between the players, and that he doesn't get the jump on you.

The general idea is to avoid his hook at all cost and keep your escape abilities for *when* he tries to hook you (and not before) so that you can safely retreat. If you can outrange his hook, you're safe to shoot at him as you please, favoring headshot if possible.

**Reinhardt**

RH isn't easy to duel, and it varies depending on if you're at long or short range. At long range, use your shield to tank damage and fireblast to lower RH's health. If you hurt him enough, you'll be able to finish him off after (and if) he hooks you. At short range, hide behind your shield until you can melee, and then go all in and don't be afraid to get hooked. But as soon as RH hooks you, use your charge to escape him after the hook. Don't try to charge a RH, he will punish you hard.

Whatever you do, keep your charge until RH has used his hook. Otherwise he'll just hook you back in the fight if you try to escape. 

**D.va**

You cannot win a 1v1 against RH. Use defense matrix to prevent taking damage before the hook, and just like Rein's charge, keep your boosters ready until RH hooks you. You can survive the hook combo, but you need to bolt right after that. 

**Winston**

Like Rein and D.va, keep your jump pack ready to use *after* he hooks you. Drop your shield bubble right as you get away to avoid getting killed in the air by a right-click.

**Zarya**

Stay away and use your lob attack. You'll do a lot of damage to RH at those distance while RH will only chip away your shield, and as an added bonus it will be more difficult for RH to aim at you. Keep your bubble ready until he tries to hook you. At long range you shouldn't have any issue using your bubble while the hook is travelling, and you'll get some energy. After that you should have lowered his HP enough so that you can rush and kill him. If you have enough energy, you can even burst him down despite the self-heal.

**Roadhog**

Never hook first. Here's why: RH1 hooks RH2, RH1 inflicts a shotgun blast and a melee attack on RH2, RH2 can return a shotgun blast, then RH2 can hook RH1, and RH2 inflicts a shotgun blast and a melee attack on RH1. If done properly, RH1 will die with RH2's second shotgun blast. There's a bit of RNG with the spread and the headshot, but basically the first RH to get two shotgun blast in the other wins. 

**Genji**

Don't use your deflect right away. RH players know to wait for the end to hook you. Keep your distances while throwing shuriken and jumping around, and only use your deflect when RH tries to hook you. Then you either run away, or you have a full 4 seconds to burst him down. Not easy, but doable with your combo if you have a good aim.

**Mccree**

If you're inside his hook range, keep your distance and roll away to escape RH's hook. Then you can fight him if you have a good aim, but don't flashbang him right away, keep that if he tries to self-heal, that will cancel it and allow you to finish him off. Or if you want to stay on the safe side, flashbang him and run away after he misses his hook.

Otherwise stay outside of his hook range and keep landing headshots on him. [More details in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/5wcf7n/a_practical_guide_on_countering_roadhog/de99i6r/).

**Pharah**

Jump very high and very far. Use your concussive blast to either gain more distance or to push RH further away. Then you can keep shooting rockets at him. 

**Reaper**

Use your wraith ability to escape his hook. Just like genji's deflect, don't pop it right away, keep your distance and wait until RH tries to hook you. Then you can either fight him up close or use your wraith form to get away from him.

**Soldier**

Run. Use your helix rockets to try to shake his aim and run. You should only try to fight him if he missed his hook or if you're outside his 20 meters hook range. [More details on how to deal with RH as soldier in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/5wcf7n/a_practical_guide_on_countering_roadhog/de99i6r/).

**Sombra**

Go invis right away and run, or use your translocator. Be careful, you can still get hooked while invisible, so if you go invis change direction. If you get the jump on RH you can try to hack him to prevent a hook, but it will still be hard for you to burst him down.

**Tracer**

Either recall right away to escape the situation, or use your blink to evade his hook. Always keep a blink ready to go if you see his hook coming, and be careful not to blink in a predictable way. A bad tracer is easy to hook, a good tracer is a nightmare. If you escape his hook you have a shot at bursting him down, but don't push your luck too much. Once you're committed in the fight, your recall will usually be useless since it won't pull you back far enough. 

**Bastion**

If you're in sentry mode, focus RH as soon as possible, you have a shot at killing him before he can hook you. Otherwise you're fucked, RH is one of the best counter to Bastion's sentry mode. In recon mode you can survive a hook combo, but you can't do much more. 

**Hanzo**

If you have a good aim (both with a standard arrow and a scatter arrow) you can burst RH down. But you don't have much time to do it, and your only chance at avoiding his hook is by wall climbing which is quite easy to predict. So keep your distance at all time.

**Junkrat**

If you're quick enough your can mine-jump to get the fuck out of the way, otherwise you're dead.

**Mei**

Depending on the situation you can ice-wall RH and run away as soon as possible, or you can wait for the hook to launch, ice-block yourself, then ice-wall as soon as you get out of iceblock to buy some time for your team to come help.

**Torbjorn**

Crouch behind your turret. If you don't have a turret, you're fucked. Time to drink one last beer.

**Widowmaker**

If you get in RH's hook range, you probably did something very wrong. You can still escape as soon as possible with your grapple, but that's your only chance.

**Ana**

Sleep RH and get far from him. Either go back to your team, or get out of his hook range and use your grenade/weapon to burst him down. You *can* get a kill this way, but it won't be easy and you better not miss.

**Lucio**

The floor is lava. I hope you practiced your walljumps because you're gonna need them.

**Mercy**

If you don't have a teammate in range to fly to, I'm so sorry for you.

**Symmetra**

Use your shield to block any hook attempt and run away. You can place a couple of turrets on your way if you want. At low ranks where player's aim isn't really good you can burst RH without him hooking you, but that's pretty dangerous. 

**Zenyatta**

Adversity is an opportunity for change. Sorry, nothing you can do if RH doesn't miss his hook. If you can evade his hook or stay outside his range, discord and headshots will do the trick. If RH self-heal, use that time to charge a right click. [Thanks to /u/aetherimp for the advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/5wcf7n/a_practical_guide_on_countering_roadhog/de99i6r/). 

## Conclusion

Overall, Zarya and Mei are strong heroes against RH. With those picks you can save enough teammates to render RH pretty useless, plus they can do damage against him. Snipers and overall long-range DPS are really good to kill a RH. Zen's discord is a real threat to RH, Ana's grenade will stop his heal and her sleep will counter his hook. 

But keep in mind that everyone can help fighting RH, even if it's just by calling out his move so that your teammates can be more prepared. I hope this guide will be useful to some people and that it will help you deal with RH. 

If you see anything that is amiss or wrong, feel free to tell me and I'll update it (also english isn't my first language, so forgive me if there's some grammar/spelling mistakes).

**TL;DR:** Your best defense against RH is good positioning. Learn your abilities that can counter his hook combo. Stay outside of his hook range if you can. Add to that focused fire to burn him down real quick and he won't be a threat much longer.Does he become paralysed from the neck up ? Does he regain movement in his limb but his brain freezes ?Hey everyone!

I'm toying around with an API project that I'm gonna run on node that will pull data from a Postgresql database hosted on DigitalOcean (in a managed database).

One thing I noticed while running some basic query to test connection is how long they take, so I started to time them to see what's up. The result is that it's taking 250ms for a very simple SELECT query. That might seem short, but considering the situation it feels long to me.

The query is very simply:

    console.time(""query"")
    
    pool.query(""SELECT * FROM public.user"", (error, results) => {
        console.timeEnd(""query"")
        console.log(results.rows)
    })

The public.user table is just 4 columns with 2 rows in it. If I try to EXPLAIN ANALYSE that query, postgres is telling me that it takes 0.25ms to plan and 0.047ms to execute. So the query itself is extremely fast on the server side.

Since I'm running node locally and the server is not here, there's a bit of latency expected. Pinging the database server gives me roughly 30ms ping. The data that is returned is only a couple hundred of bytes, so it shouldn't take long to transfer (especially on a fiber optic connection).

So the question is: where does the time go? 250ms is not very long, but considering the query takes less than a single ms and the server is only 30ms away, I would expect sub 100ms for a query like this. I'm really curious as to what's happening here causing this delay. Any idea?After careful analysis of the available data, the cause is clear: the asteroid slowed down at the last minute to avoid the impact.So long story short, next week I'll be tasked with taking pictures of a theme party where everyone will be dressed up and wearing make up.

Part of this will be a photo booth where I'll take pictures of group of friends together, which is something I've never done yet. And I would love a few pointers in how to ""direct"" those groups to get interesting pictures. Because saying ""say cheese"" will quickly become boring.

So I'm looking for some ideas of faces to ask from them to break the routine. The sillier the better. Not looking for poses however, space will be too tight to be creative on that front.Hi everyone !

So I have this friend who never saw X-files. I know she'll probably like it, but she already has tons of movies and tv shows to watch, so I took it upon myself to pick one episode hoping she would get hooked. I've been thinking about it for quite a while, but I'd like some outside opinions.

So here's a couple of thoughts I had about how to pin down the perfect starting episode:

* No episodes directly connected with the mythology (except for the pilot)
* No episode centered on Scully (because I globally hate them, sorry)
* Not one of the best episode ever (it would suck to start a show with the best episode only to realize all the others are not as good)
* Not one of the comedy episode (not really representative of most of the show)

So basically I'm looking for one of those MOTW episode that would show:

* The relationship between Mulder & Scully
* The dynamic of the investigation, the paranormal aspect of the show, the medical examinations, the FBI etc...
* The humor of the show (even in the more serious and dark episodes there's often a couple of things that make me chuckle)

I know, I just summed up pretty much every MOTW episodes. I do have some favorites myself (Squeeze or Darkness Falls for example), but I was hoping to hear from you. What is basically the most X-filey X-files episode. I was also considering simply showing her the pilot, because I think it's a fantastic pilot for the mythology of the show, but I also find it a bit slow-paced as a starting point.

So, any ideas ? Have you hooked a friend with an episode ? 

EDIT : went out for a beer, got home with tons of great recommandations ! Too drunk to answer to all of you, but you guys rock ! Thanks for all the awesome advice, I'll take them under consideration.


I often see people arguing about how the leveling system works, why it is so easy to level up, even if you didn't do any quests or gained new stats you automatically gain a new level. And I think there's a lot of misconception about it. Since I couldn't find the game manual, I started to think about it, and I may have a theory about how the leveling system works.


First, we have to take a look back. Back to really early version of the game, when the [human] race was first available, in versions before [00.x]. Back then, it was really hard to survive. We got lots of PvP, lots of really hard PvE, even the [disease] feature was far more deadly before players developed [medicine] and [vaccines] items. Therefor I think the game was designed with survival in mind, and the main quest is to survive the longest. Each day that you survive you gain an experience point, and you get to a new level every 365 xp.


All the other major quests you do, such as finding a [job], are actually part of that main quest. You can gain [money] with these kind of quests, and it's much easier to survive if you can buy [food] items, [clothing], [house] etc... It's not just mindless farming, it's a very intricate system, because something that can seems as useless as doing the [college] quest, actually helps you later on finding a better [job]. There's a lot of pitfall on the way, the [drug] sidequests seems cool at first, but can quickly deteriorate your ability to survive, and therefor are usually bad for the main quest.


The thing is, in the later versions of the game, it's much easier to survive on [europe] and [USA], but that's only because players in those regions created a lot of newb-friendly systems ([government], [bank loans], [health care], [education facility] etc). We even have access to a lot of items that can boost our stats. So basically if you spawned on these regions you're in casual mode. But we still have a choice if we want to play on harder difficulty. You can find a [dangerous job] where survival is key in [military] organisation if you want PvP, or you can always go live in [third-world region] to have some PvE. If you're not happy with a grinding [job], you can start you're own [company], it's much more interesting, but much harder. 


So basically, I think people should stop complaining about the leveling system. The only reason some of you might think it's too easy or stupid, is because you're playing the game on easy mode. If you want a real challenge, to experience the game as it was first designed, with a lot of PvP, dangerous [diseases], epic battles vs [animals], you can still do that. Just go to a [third-world region], but be careful, you can get instakilled very easily. If you want to stay on easy mode that's fine by me, a lot of people seems happy with it, but don't blame the leveling system for it.


All in all I think the game is supposed to be play on hard mode, that's when the more interesting things happen, but I'm glad we can still play on easy mode for people not wanting a greater challenge.Hey everyone

I'm a bit puzzled here, I was trying to add a small function that depends on a random number, and while testing it it kept giving me the same random number every time I relaunched the app. To isolate the problem I created a brand new app (with the ""Empty activity"") from Android Studio, and I pasted this code in my MainActivity's onCreate:

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
    val testRandom1 = (0..100).random()
    Log.d(""DebugRandom"", ""$testRandom1"")
    val testRandom2 = kotlin.random.Random.nextInt()
    Log.d(""DebugRandom"", ""$testRandom2"")
    val testRandom3 = kotlin.random.Random.nextInt(0, 100)
    Log.d(""DebugRandom"", ""$testRandom3"")
    
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    
    val testRandom4 = (0..100).random()
    Log.d(""DebugRandom"", ""$testRandom4"")
    val testRandom5 = kotlin.random.Random.nextInt()
    Log.d(""DebugRandom"", ""$testRandom5"")
    val testRandom6 = kotlin.random.Random.nextInt(0, 100)
    Log.d(""DebugRandom"", ""$testRandom6"")

Every call gives me a different number, but every time I launch the app I get the exact same 6 results. If I launch it on a different device I get different numbers, but they stay the same every subsequent launch.

What did I miss? Is that not how you're supposed to get a random number in Kotlin?So this week I had a pretty stupid/happy moment with my dog that I wanted to share with you boys and girls.

Two and half years ago I adopted a dog from a rescue shelter. His name is Sam and he was three years old back then. Like every dog owner, I was curious to see how my dog would react when watching a video of other dogs. 

So once he got acclimated to his new home, I went on youtube to find some dog videos and showed them to Sam. No reaction, nada, zero, zip. No matter if it was in HD or not, he just didn't ""see"" what was happening on the screen. He would however react to the sound of dogs playing/barking/growling/howling, but he would focus his attention to the speakers. Well no matter, I still loved him.

This week I played Fallout 4. Sam was lying next to me half asleep and at some point he jumped up, tail-waggingly happy, looking at the screen with his look of ""oh boy I want to play"". I was a bit surprised, I wondered if Sam wanted to move to Boston maybe? But no, he was reacting to dogmeat, and desperately wanted to play with him.

So WTF right? Why can't he see dogs in some beautiful HD videos but he can see a janky-animated dog with blurry textures? Well the answer is obvious: Fallout 4 was running at 60fps while the videos I showed him more than two years ago were in 30fps.

I went to youtube to test my hypothesis, found some 60 fps dog video, and sure enough it worked. He saw the dogs in them, followed their movement, trying to get their attention by whining/barking. He was a bit weirded out because  he could hear and see the dogs but couldn't smell them, and he was always looking behind the screen when dogs would walk out of the frame, but he saw them. I tried again with 30 fps videos, no reaction. 

**TL;DR**: My dog simply cannot see at less than 60fps. He can't see at peasant's framerates. So let me introduce Sam, a true PCMR brethren: http://i.imgur.com/nuFYAyg.jpgHey what's up guys.

Quick storytime: used to play support and a bit of off tank up until season 4-5 then stopped playing. Came back recently in mid-high plat and I find a lot of triple dps comp, and I honestly don't know how I'm supposed to play support in that.

My main healer of choice were always ana or zen in almost every situation. But in triple dps comp I find that everyone is a lot more agressive, flanking a lot, leaving the backline quite exposed. Winston used to be an annoyance that I could sleep/evade long enough until someone chase him away, he has now become a death sentence that makes me switch out of zen immediately. And if he leaves his bubble in the right place I can't heal with ana until I reposition.

I've tried sticking close to the solo tank instead of playing way back, but it's a gamble. If the enemy team pushes too much (like with a reaper or brig) I die quickly.

So I've tried playing more mobile support, like Moira or lucio. I can now survive much much longer, and I can somewhat keep up with the agressive plays, but healing is a bit on the low side and lose a lot of effectiveness if everyone is scattered. Sticking close to the tank seems to be a good idea, I can easily escape enemies push while helping the tank, but then DPS who flank are on their own and I don't feel like I'm contributing much.

The only play that I consider really good is mercy. Tons of healing, can quickly reposition, she's perfect. But there can only be one.

So basically the question is, how do I play support in a triple dps comp? Should I play close to the tank or focus on healing the dps? Should I stick to the backline and focus more on dealing with flankers/Winston? Is brig a good pick to help the other healer deal with a pesky tracer/sombra or should she stick in the frontline? Are ana and zen viable in any way with triple dps?"

mdedm,10,10,"I hate to go on a rant here, but I see a lot of ""buy it for life"" requests for sturdy, quality items that cost WAY too much. Some of this is totally unnecessary.

Do you want a belt that will last forever? You probably have your research done on what this should be... metal buckle, thick leather, etc. So, go to Tandy Leather Factory and order the strap and buckle, then make it yourself. You could do the same thing for a wallet. 

Want some toys that will never break? Get a coping saw, some sandpaper, and a chunk of wood and make a toy car. You can find patterns everywhere.

Need a pair of sandals that will never wear out? Make them out of a semi tire you find on the road.

Need a sturdy pair of boots? Get a pair that can be resoled. Bonus points if you resole them with tire rubber.

Did that work out? Now try making something bigger. Before long, you'll be able to make your own stuff and reinforce it and overbuild it as much as you want.

BIFL can easily mean Build it For Life, too. You don't have to buy everything you own."
SamiTheBystander,10,5,"The quest requires you to collect 100 seals from the raid, what's supposed to happen is one of the main rooms counts as 13 seals and the colosseum part would give you 5 seals each time. I know this because that's how many show to be dripping for you when you complete a part. BUT, you actually only get 1 seal. That means you would have to do the raid in its entirety 13 times to complete this step, and there's no way that's what bungie meant to happen. 

Video proof I threw together last night: https://youtu.be/jb6_j_qYrOo

Please help me get this to bungie!So some background: I am a 23 year old bi guy, I came out at like 14 then went deeply back in the closet till like 20 because I wasn’t as ready to be out as I thought. (Turns out when everyone thinks bisexuality is a phase it’s very easy to pretend it was a phase)

SO I was just taking a shower and thinking about some old friends from elementary school and wondering what happened to them. I remembered that two of my friends from back then are queer now and then it hit me; those two guys and I jerked off for the first time together. 

Yes, my first ever jerk off experience was at 11 years old group jerking with two other dudes. 

And I thought I was straight for 3 more years. 

I thought nothing of how gay it was even when the other two came out. 

Can I apply for a historical lit PhD now?"
Imapseudonorm,6,5,"Back in the day I used to work for a MSP.  I ended up being the lead tech, so I had to run the gamut from residential service calls to basically being the sole IT for a reasonably sized DoD contractor.  I'd get a thumbnail sketch from dispatch, head out, fix the problem, then go onto the next client.

I've been enjoying the stories here, so I figured I'd contribute one of my most memorable ones.

Dispatch sent me to this ladies house because after her computer wouldn't boot right.

I show up, knock on the door, she answers while being on the phone.  We mime a few pleasantries, and she walks me to her basement.

I look around, see a everything off the floor, stacked on the desktops.  

Ah... recent construction.  Ok.

So I scope things out, taking in the haphazard computer placement, the cords still cluttering around, the surge protector plugged into itself, but overall, everything seems fine.

So I go ahead and put the stuff on the floor, plug in the surge protector, and boot the computer.

It's a little slow, but nothing's jumping out at me as ""being wrong.""

I've been there about five minutes when she walks in, and stops in surprise.

>$client:""Oh!  You fixed it 

>me:  Um... Ma'am?

>$client:""It wouldn't turn on.""

>me:  :::suddenly it's dawning on me:::  You mean your computer wouldn't turn on at all?

>$client:""Yeah, we had some work done, but we never got the computer working after that.""

>me: Ah, I think I know what your problem was.  Did you ever plug the surge protector into the wall?

>$client: :::stops, thinks... face becomes crestfallen:::   Will you do me a favor?

>me: ?

>$client:  When you tell your friends about this, don't mention my name please.
     
tl;dr:  

Just because it's plugged in, doesn't mean it's plugged in right.  

				OR

Plugging a surge protector into itself does not in fact power the computer.


I'd been working for the MSP for long enough to really get into my groove.

I was the lead tech, and known as the guy to call if you couldn't figure stuff out.  Unfortunately, that means I started to get a little blasé about my job.

Most of my work was corportate stuff now, but they still occasionally sent me out to houses if the other techs were busy.  I got into a routine, used a standard patter while I was working on the clients computer, etc.  Chat about work, chat about kids, chat about pets, pretend not to see the porn on the computer, etc.

Sometimes that didn't work out so well.

I showed up at the clients house, sit down at the computer.  Standard virus removal, no worries.  Start up my toolset, get some scans going, engage banter mode.

Look around the office, see a bunch of clues on which tack to take here.  Some include the two monitors with ""for non-classified use only"" on them, see the bank statements from a bank that's widely known in the area to be the bank for most CIA employees, etc. Given the area (DC suburb) decide to start in on the ""how do you like working for the government"" line of conversation.

***oops***

Client IMMEDIATELY went from friendly and engaged to icy and hostile.  Her eyes started darting around the room, and her entire body screamed ""LIAR.""  

> $poor_liar:""um... what... do you mean?  We... um... Don't work for the government.""

I quickly backpedaled, dropped my ""charming IT guy act,"" and got serious.  ""Ma'am, I apologize, clearly I shouldn't have asked anything, and I hope you're not upset.""  However, IF one of you did work for the government, and IF it was critical to keep that fact a secret, then here's what I saw that you might want to be aware of.  After being given the entire list, she thawed slightly, and after I got her problem fixed, she seemed genuinely thankful for my work.

It still baffles me to this day how clueless end users are about what information they are giving out without meaning to.  Like the guy who set up the web cam over his RSA key fob because he got tired of leaving it at home.  :|

TL;DR:  Found a hush hush government operative while removing their virus

OR

OPSEC becomes NOPESEC.I can do this.  I've been working with computers for years now.  Sure, I've only been working for this MSP for about a week, and I've never done any professional computer stuff before this, but I can handle this.  It's 2004 after all, and I have google at my side.  With that, I can solve anything.

Or so I thought.

I think it was my fifth call ever for the MSP I was working for.  The notes say that the customer's VPN isn't working.

I like to think I didn't have to look up what that acronym was at that point, which means I at least new something about the technology.  I may be fooling myself with even that, though.

However, I'm new to this job, and I'd like to keep it, so I don't want to let on how little I know.  

I show up to the clients house.  Usual banter ensues, and she takes me up to the top floor, and sits me down in front of her computer.  Sure enough, internet works, little slow, but usable.

I then use the ""so... show me how you usually access your VPN"" gambit.  It works!  She sits down, and keeps me from having to demonstrate how little I know about what's really going on.

Sure enough, VPN starts to connect, connects, then drops.  

That's not normal, right?  Hrm... Let's assume it's not normal.

Engage more banter while doing stuff that hopefully looks ""tech-like.""  Dos window, ping stuff, check logs, etc.  Hrm... ping isn't returning stuff it normally does.  Something about dropped packets.  I should look that up if she steps out of the room, but in the mean time I know what I'm doing.  Ask client usual ""what happened between the time it was working and when it stopped,"" client responds with ""nothing I can think of.""  

The sweat is just because it's hot in here, not because I'm clueless.

It's been half an hour.  Client finally asks the dreaded question point blank: 

>$client:""So what do you think is wrong?""  
$clueless tech:""Um, lemme see if I can think of a good way to explain it using not technical terms"" :::eyes darting around the room, looking for something shiny to distract the client while I run away in fear. Eyes land on something.  Seems important.  
$less clueless tech:""So, do you have a cat or a dog?""  
$client: ""Cat, how did you know?""  
$no longer sweating tech: :::holds up partially chewed through Ethernet cable::: I think I may have found your problem.

Sure enough, replace the Ethernet cable, problem is solved.

TL;DR:

Layer 1 CATastrophic problems

or

It doesn't matter if the cable is plugged in if the cable has been partially chewed through


 
The bad news is I don't think my gym will let me back in :(

http://wavy.com/2015/03/16/shaking-felt-from-va-beach-to-obx/Having heard such good things about their products, I purchased 4 pairs of Duluth's Buck Naked underwear.  They were awesome, and I've debated picking up another 10 pair or so to make them my sole underwear.  They really are as comfortable as advertised.  But when I went to put on a pair this morning, I noticed a small hole developing along one of the stitching.  

Normally I'd just say fuck it and keep on wearing it until I was more likely to put a leg in the rip hole than the leg hole, but I spent a lot of money on these things, so I decided to send Duluth an email.  A couple of hours later, I got an email basically saying ""our bad, which pair has the problem, and where should we send them?""

They're not even asking for the defective pair back, which means I can sew it up (again, the fabric is just separating at the seam, so it should be simple).

I know where I'm going for the rest of my gear from here on out.  Great product, and they're definitely standing true to their word.Bretheren,  I know not if this is fake or real, but I thought it would greatly appreciated here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4TJkPLN_g8Howdy all, first post, but I don't know who else to share with.  Been sporting a decent beard for a few years now, but recently decided to shave it, and do it right.

So I got a starter kit from Stirling Soap, watched a few videos, did some reading, and went to down on my beard.  

When I finally came to from all the blood loss, I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt.  I may have just still been woozy, but I sat there in my freshly reddened bathroom rubbing my face in awe.

That was earlier this week, and I just got done shaving without a single nick.  Not even from one of my three moles that I suppose may have departed at some point this week.  Three separate passes, and a completely dry allum stick and no need for toilet paper.

Hooray!  This is probably a repeat, but I haven't seen it recently.  I saw someone else make this mistake recently, so I thought I'd point it out here.  Fire safes work (essentially) though wet brick keeping the temperature inside the safe below the point at which paper burns.

However, the temp it does allow is still enough to melt most plastics, so don't store cd's/dvd's/flash drives/hard drives in a fire safe and think you're protected.So I just added another 12 TB array, and decided to move everything over to it.  I thought crashplan would see the files, and realize that they already had them.  The 3.7 years it said it would take the update to complete told me otherwise.

No problem, I'm a crafty guy.  I created the old folder it was backing up, and just made it a symbolic link to the new stuff.

Yeah, I'm sure someone reading this is cringing.

Boom.  Backup wiped.  I've looked around and it looks like my 6Tb of uploaded data is completely gone.  I knew this was a risk, and I've seen lots of other posts complaining about how easy it is to wipe a backup, but those were older posts.

Is there even any point in contacting crashplan at this point?  Or just give up, and go back up manually uploading everything?"

rabidsi,7,4,"So I'm currently on my second playthrough and when Joel, Ellie, Henry and Sam pass through the toy shop and Sam is forced to leave the little toy robot thing, I wanted to see if Ellie actually picks it up (since she later reveals she has indeed picked it up on the sly).

So, after the cut scene played I watched Ellie. She does indeed walk over to the robot and stare at it, but that's all she does. I was kind of disappointed and turned to walk away... and then, just as I panned the camera around and put Ellie out of view, I heard a little swish like you would hear when picking an item up. Turning back quickly, the robot is gone, and Ellie just strolls away.

* Half-Life 2: Dawinsky
* Tomb Raider Trilogy: Riddy86

Hey guys, I've got a (technically) unopened retail copy of Tomb Raider Trilogy (Classics HD collection) for PS3 I want to offload. It was a doubled up gift, so I have no need of it. The seal is broken, but 90% of the wrapper is still on there... the game is unused and technically brand new. The three games included on the disc are HD remakes of Tomb Raider Legend and Tomb Raider Anniversary (a remastered version of the original Tomb Raider on PS1), along with Tomb Raider Underworld.

This is only available to mainland UK addresses because I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for shipping. Please bear in mind I'll be asking for your address if you win so if you're uncomfortable with that, don't play!

Also, I have a gift code for Half-Life 2 on Steam that I've been failing to get rid of for a decade now. Someone, please take it from me. PLEASE. **I BEG YOU.**

I'll select two winners, one for each title, and will announce winners tomorrow.

**Please be sure to include in your post which of the games you would like. As long as you meet the mainland UK restriction for TRT, I'll allow you to state interest in both, but I'll still be picking two winners. Thanks!**

travlbum,10,10,"Short version
I had a pet sitter come to take care of my dog and cat. I saw her doing some weird shit, so I kicked her out.

Long version 
I checked my security camera and saw the sitter take my dog out of the apartment, unleashed. And the cat. She took my unleashed dog and uncollared indoor cat out. So I asked my building manager for CCTV footage. She didn’t see anything, so the cat never made it out of the building. The manager did find video from earlier in the day showing the sitter trying to get the dog onto a motorcycle: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9htioeoja4nfmnq/Video%20Mar%2006%2C%208%2020%2019%20PM.mp4?dl=0

This didn’t answer my question of “wtf was she doing with my dog and cat out of the apartment?” but, it was enough that I decided to kick her out. Had my gf and a friend put all her shit down by the guard room with a note. 

Came to find that the sitter took the dog to a nearby park on the back of a motorcycle taxi after driving her own motorcycle didn’t work out.

As for the cat incident later in the day, turns out she took the dog and cat to the gym in my building to hang out. To get to the gym you have to walk through a parking lot that has a gate that leads to a busy street and dangerous stray dogs. My 13kg dog was unleashed and has no recall training. My cat is indoor only with no collar. Anyone see any potential issues?

She’s trying to accuse me of violating the rules for kicking her out and demanding that I let her return to finish the sit. Am I being unreasonable?

update: The platform where I found this sitter shut down her account.Last week there was that great jazz post. But what I didn't like so much was all the YouTube links. I'll kick it off:

Throwback Pop - a short playlist with some great indie songs with a retro feel: http://open.spotify.com/user/loltron/playlist/0UmWPxiFaUf6EUMEUhHYyM

The Red Army Choir - you haven't lived until you've spent a work day listening to Soviet marches: http://open.spotify.com/album/4S1ucVsqGX2t2tZxls9DiQ

Maxim Vengerov - my favorite performance of Wieniawski's Polonaise Brillante in D Major, if you enjoy violin solos you're in for a treat: http://open.spotify.com/album/02oujv1KDdUUjFjVuQyPMz

Mellow Beats - it's a Spotify playlist, but a great one: http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/3hpgM1U3bD6kvo7wJubQ8z

Your turn!

EDIT: While working, I use Bose QC25's, as I'm often in noisy cafes. Also, while working I usually listen to jazz or classical music, so the anemic bass doesn't matter so much. I also use them while traveling and for movies.

If I feel like listening to something electronic, like the Throwback Pop or Mellow Beats playlists, I'll bring along my V-MODA M100s.

And if I'm at home, it's the Shure 1540s, which are just lovely. They are reserved and detailed enough for jazz and classical and vocals, but holy shit the bass they are capable of is really fantastic. They do a great job on all fronts."
SockMonkey4Life,5,1,"Recently I saw a post that was wondering about which cup is better: atk% or anemo dmg bonus.Because of Xiao's ult being additive now, atk% might be better, so I ran some numbers.

I tested Primordial Jade-Winged Spear (stacks and no stacks) as well as Deathmatch.The numbers I got were:

With Anemo Cup, Xiao during his ult will do \~7% more dmg than if an ATK% cup was used.This number is a bit insignificant but is still a decent improvement.

Obviously ATK% cup will make Xiao do more physical dmg when hes not ulting. An ATK% cup will make Xiao do about \~15% more physical dmg when not ulting compared to an Anemo cup.

However, the biggest numbers I saw were using Xiao's E when not ulting. A non-ult E will do about \~21% more dmg with an Anemo cup than with an ATK% cup.

Controlled variables that were used are:-2pc Glad 2pc VV

\-an average of 10 atk% as a substat in each artifact that can have atk% as well as lvl 20 artifacts

\-a lvl 80/90 Xiao using lvl 90 weapons-lvl 8 Ult

**TLDR:** Atk% cup is okay if you plan to do normal and charged attacks outside of your ult. However, Anemo Cup is superior if you dont plan to normal and charged attacks much outside of his ult. One thing to keep in mind is that ATK buffs are common (such as Bennett, 4pc Nobless, Thrilling Dragonslayers, etc.) which will further make Anemo Cup better than Atk% cup, as well as having more atk% in substatsI've seen a lot of Europeans who are mad at America for its ""vaccine nationalism"" and the America-first vaccine plan. What are your thoughts on their thoughts?"
AriesAviator,8,2,"It's so hard to explain why you like rats to non-rat people. 

Yeah, you can talk about how friendly, how clean, how easy to take care of, how charming and sweet and adorable they are- but people really just don't get it. You can get the same affection from a dog or cat, right? So why a rat, a weird, stinky, worm-tailed little vermin creature? The cultural perception of all rodents as either these pest-ridden menaces or a childs disposable first pet experience is so hard for people to look past. 

For me, it's... imagine the trust it takes for a rat to let you pick it up, this tiny little potato sized creature with no appreciable natural defenses. You are a giant ape with strength enough to rip it apart without even feeling it. You can't even speak the same language, even body language! Very little about you and your motivations are understandable by rat standards. 

And yet my rats will let me wiggle them around like a sausage on the end of a fork. They never think I might hurt them, even by accident- the possibility that I could do so doesn't even occur to them. As far as they are concerned, I am a weird, giant, alien monster covered in too little fur that never ages and dispenses treats on command, and they have total and utter faith in my benevolence. These little bastards will bully me into giving them snacks and then snatch my own food right off my fork if they can get away with it, and they do it because they just can't think I'll hurt them over it. Imagine the blind faith that takes. 

A cat or dog can defend itself with teeth or claws, if it has to. That bond is built on a mutual understanding that you're both buddies and you don't *want* to hurt the other, but the *option* is always there. Rats, a prey animal, who have evolved a constant terror of large, fast moving things, don't have any of that. Only trust that you won't eat them, yeet them, or suddenly turn around and smack them into another dimension. 

It's just so tremendously flattering to be friends with a creature barely the size of your fist and have it trust you enough to let you pick it up and pop you up on your shoulder for a little ride around. I sure couldn't fuckin do that if I was the small one. 

Rats man.Have you ever wondered where exactly you would wind up if you too got snatched by an inter-dimensional wormhole and dumped in everyone's favorite fantasy world? Wonder no further! Simply follow these simple guidelines to fully enjoy your kidnapping experience;

1. Scream. Best to get that out of the way early. 

2. Cast yourself back to your choice of 30 minutes, 6 hours, or a full 24 hours ago! Pick one choice now, and no switching- the Gods are watching for all you dirty cheaters. Where were you? What were you doing? What did you have on you? Hold that image in your mind!

3. The most important step; [spin the wheel](https://pickerwheel.com/pw?id=AMPsv) to find where you get dropped! 


You get to keep anything that you actively had on you: and for extra flavor, those lucky bastards that were in a car or on a bike get to take the whole vehicle with them! And of course, if you happened to be riding in the passengers seat, that is 100% not a fault of the spell and there will be no refunds! 

Have fun kids! Remember, dying horribly builds character!"

shaggy1265,7,8,"Before people start, Bluehole has shown they aren't opposed to delaying patches if they are broken. One of the monthly patches was almost delayed but they were able to solve the issue last minute.

But that was never going to happen with this update because of the keys. They weren't going to delay their revenue stream. And they aren't going to roll it back either even though the server issues are going to take who [knows how long to fix.](https://twitter.com/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/status/893183287350353920)

This is why it's important to keep developers accountable for what they say they are going to do. They changed their focus toward microtransactions and the game is already suffering.

Edit: Grammar mistake.One scene that highlighted it for me was when the crew were debating on whether or not they should push 15g's to keep up with Eros. The debate only lasted a short while before Naomi yelled something along the lines of ""Dammit, Miller is down there risking his ass for us we can at least do the same up here"".

And just like that everyone shut their damn traps and got to work. The looks on their faces showed they realized she was right and there was no further arguments.

I expected that conversation to go on a lot longer. A lot of other shows would have done that and then made us wait until after a commercial break to find out what they were going to do. People would have made really dumb arguments on both sides and some of them might have held a grudge after because of it.

This was a great episode and I know Miller and Julie was the highlight, but this scene really stuck out to me as well and I haven't seen anyone talk about it. I thought it was a great example of how this show is doing drama/suspense correctly. The characters are written like real people, instead of drama filled teenage girls.This is something I've been thinking about recently. People (including myself) love CDPR because they made a quality game and you can tell they made it for their fans. People rallied behind them after feeling like they have been treated poorly by many big developers and publishers.

However, when it comes to CIG it's the complete opposite. Anyone who follows SC development for even a little bit will be able to tell that these guys are at the very least *trying* to give us a great game. They are working hard and are every bit as passionate about SC as CDPR was about TW3. Yet CIG is mostly met with criticism and negativity. People will go out of their way to misrepresent things and act like they are just trying to steal your money or whatever. 

Makes me wonder what would have happened if CDPR released alpha builds of TW3. I don't think it would have gotten as much praise if people got to play the unstable builds during development. Also makes me wonder if consumers will ever really understand the early access model and what goes into game development. People still act like these games are supposed to be bug free.


Anyway those are just some thoughts and I wanted to see what other people around here thought. I really think CIG and CDPR are similar in a lot of ways but people treat them way differently.My ex left me for the guy she was with before me. I had fallen deeply in love and before this happened I was convinced I was going to spend the rest of my life with her. She was the only thing keeping me happy at that point (other issues with family/work at that time) so it crushed me.

I spent the next 5 months in a depression. The only time I could have fun was when I was hanging out with friends. Being alone brought me down so much.

One night some friends came over and we were drinking. All was good until they left and I felt more sad than I ever had. I felt so sad I just stopped caring about everything. This was probably intensified by the alcohol but I remember the feeling vividly. The house could have exploded and I wouldn't have cared. I laid in bed for a couple hours staring at the ceiling till I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning still feeling down but it was back to the 'normal' feeling (mornings were always rough for me).

I went to work and when I got there I started feeling better (which was normal). As I started feeling better I started thinking about the night before. I remembered how I felt and I realized I never wanted to feel like that again. It was at that moment that I got over my ex and realized I have more life ahead of me and I need to make sure those days are happier.

So like I said my ex was the only thing that was making me happy. I realized this was not right, there should be more than that. I began to look at my life and figure out what was bringing me down and/or holding me back. I made a list with goals and a game plan on how to achieve them and have been actively working on it since.

Ever since that day I have been able to take on challenges like never before. I don't procrastinate on things anymore, I just figure out how to do it and make it happen. I have become much more focused on things and can get things done faster. I feel like my life is progressing forward for the first time in a long time and it's awesome.

It's crazy how me being so sad I stopped caring is what motivated me to change my life around.

So what is your story?"
myheartisstillracing,4,8,"I brought a large group (~25) of teenagers out for dinner tonight. We were willing to sit separately in small groups to ease the process. 

Despite calling ahead, there was a bit of a mixup, so it took a while to get seated and sorted, but it all worked out. Whatever. I deal with this multiple times a year, so I learned a long time ago to roll with it.

As we left, I thanked the manager for helping us. At first, he just stared at me. I repeated it. Finally, a server standing there said ""You're welcome!"" then turned to him and said, ""She's actually trying to say Thank You."" He sort of shook himself out of it and apologized, because he had assumed I was being sarcastic and trying to insult him or pick a fight. I actually had to convince him I meant ""Thank you"".

Anyways, thank y'all for what is apparently a very thankless job![Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wilsx/me_30f_with_my_boyfriend_31_m_of_almost_7_years_i/)

Quick summary of the situation:

Boyfriend of 7 years has been maintaining a relationship with another woman (who did not know about me) for at least 2 years. She is very likely not the only thing/person he has lied to me about. Thursday night I found out, told him to get out, then left in the morning for a 3-day work trip. I came home tonight.

The update:

I got home from my work trip at about 8:30pm tonight (Sunday). He was not here and 3/4 of his stuff was gone as well. I believe he has taken me at my word when I said I never wanted to see him again. There has been no communication at all, except I did send him an email at 5pm instructing him to email the landlord (and CC me) that he wishes to be released from the lease and have the full responsibility for the apartment returned to me. He has not replied as of yet, but it doesn't seem he wishes to drag this out.

I started rearranging things to the way they were before he moved in. It was good, because the place was looking awkward and half-moved and now it looks much better. Almost like home again in the living room actually. It will be a good excuse to go through my clothes and clear out things I don't need anymore. I get the closet back! I have SO much room. He had SO much stuff. I also found a few of his things still mixed in with mine that I set out in the kitchen for him to take.

I'm not sure if he'd like to take back the nice baking dish from his grandmother, but it is in the fridge and has an unbaked ziti in it that was meant for his birthday. His favorite dish for his birthday. Tomorrow (Monday). He's welcome to take it, but I doubt he will touch it. Frankly, I don't really want it either. (The ziti anyway. It is a nice baking dish, after all...)


As for me? I'm doing about as well as could be expected, considering the situation. My family and friends have been supportive. My sister is coming to spend the night with me tomorrow. There have been a few tears, but for the most part his betrayal is so egregious that I feel it left little room for ambiguity. In some ways it makes it much easier: I have no reason to doubt that I made the correct decision and am better off without him in my life. Thankfully, he seems to be cooperating.

There are still several loose ends that will have to get tied up before I can say the situation is truly resolved. Then will begin the process of adjusting to living my life without him again, but I will focus on strengthening my relationships with the people who care for me and in taking the best care of myself that I can. I will be okay.

**tl;dr** 

I came home from my trip and most of his stuff is gone. It appears he is going to leave quietly and I will be able to get on with my life, without him. Good riddance.


*edit 1* 

Monday night. Not sleeping great. Dammit. I just realized my $2 drug store red fleece blanket is gone. I'll have to contact him after all to tell him to return it. I imagine it got taken with the other blankets from the living room that were his. He still has about 1 carload of stuff, his dresser, a tall bookcase, and his motorcycle to pick up. I would like him to tell me his timetable for removing them, so I might as well demand that while I'm after my blanket. I don't like this feeling in the pit of my stomach not knowing what I'm coming home to at the end of the day.

*edit 2*

He responded to my text that he will return the blanket and pick up more, and possibly all, of the rest of his things tomorrow. He also emailed the landlord and requested to be removed from the lease as I asked him to do.Pass it on.My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 7 years. We've lived together for a little over a year.

Tonight a little after 9, I was sitting on the couch relaxing before bed. Mike (we'll call him that...) was not home. He had said he wouldn't be home for dinner or a while after, so this was not unexpected. There was a knock at the door. I looked through the peephole and there was a blond woman holding a hot chocolate. I cracked the door. She said she wasn't sure if this was the right place, but did Mike live here? She had brought him hot chocolate because he said he was studying, but wasn't at the library. When I said that Mike lived here but wasn't home, she said, ""Oh, I'm Kate, the woman he's been dating. Do you know when he'll be back?"" Needless to say, I invited her in. I asked her again to clarify who she was. Then, she asked who I was. When I said, ""His girlfriend"", her face went blank. She said he told her he had roommates, including a woman. That's who she thought I was. Nope.

It turns out that a couple years ago, she had an affair with Mike. She divorced her husband. She and Mike have been seeing each other ever since.

This weekend, while I'm away for work, they had plans to spend the night in the city. She bought him Book of Morman tickets for his birthday. 

I invited her to stay for a bit, but she had her kids home with a sitter. We were both kind of standing around in shocked silence, occasionally asking a clarifying question of each other to determine the extent of his lies. We exchanged contact info, just in case. She left.

I called Mike. I told him to come home right away. He was already on his way, so it only took about 10 minutes. When he walked in the door, I asked him if there were anything he felt I should know about? Anything I should have known about for years? I was pointed. His face was silent and guilty.

After the obligatory assertion that he is a liar and a cheat, and a shitty human being to boot, I told him to pack his things. I don't care where he goes, but he needs to find a new place ASAP. I will be away this weekend. He can use the time to start moving his things. He can stay on the couch until he figures it out.

She's not the only one. I'm sure of it now. I didn't really let him explain too much, because there really isn't much point in explaining anything at all. His lies border on pathological apparently, so why should I give him the chance to spew more? In fairness, he denied nothing. Oh, he's so unhappy with the choices he's made? Boohoo. You're a grown man, and the choices you make each day shape the life you want to live. If you don't like the choices you're making, make different ones.

We're done. Apparently, we never were. People used to joke about him being my invisible boyfriend because his job kept him so busy. I guess they were right. He always was a pretend boyfriend after all.

I was ready to marry this man. I loved him completely. I haven't even really cried at this point. Maybe I will. Someday. It's his loss. He's not even worth crying over.

I just really really needed to tell my story. (To someone besides my best friend, who got the first phone call...) Put it in words to make them real. It still sounds like the script to a Lifetime movie. Only, in that version we'd be married with kids, so I guess i've got that going for me. I never have to speak to him again after he gives back his key.

Thanks internet.

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend of 7 years has had another steady girlfriend for years. We did not know about each other. She drops by. We both find out. Bye bye boyfriend. I will mourn more for the loss of the idea of him than for him. He isn't worth it. I deserve better.

*edit 1* If tears were shed tonight, they were shed due to kind words from internet strangers. Thanks.

*edit 2* It's Saturday, I have been kept VERY busy with work stuff. I'll try to get to more replies later today. I slept a solid 8 hours last night after not sleeping AT ALL on Thursday night. Sleep helped. I've started talking to my friends and family so they know what is going on. Everyone has been very supportive. I've already unfriended him, his brother, and his sister-in-law on facebook, so I don't have to see anything about them. His sister-in-law's response to my telling her was, verbatim, ""Family-first"". I told her to have a nice life. When I get back from my work trip I'm going to grab some food with a couple friends. One of them is going to come back to the house with me Sunday night, since I don't know what I will be walking in to. Will he be there? (Unlikely, I think...) Will his stuff still be there? It'll be nice to have someone there to process it. 

[Link to Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2wu67i/update_me_30f_with_my_boyfriend_31m_of_almost_7/)No, really. I know it was Friday before the short week before winter break and the viral TikTok threats meant lots of kids were out and the ones that were they were looking to get an easy day with no work, but...

In my last period class we were introducing Newton's 3rd Law and one of my kids that sits up front was roped into the little demo with 2 spring scales pulling on each other I always do first thing. He (good naturedly) tried to argue with me about it. Well, what if one I pulled this way? Well, what if one of the springs was harder to stretch than the other? It was like he was a plant in the audience for all he asked exactly the right questions at the right time. Most of the other students just observed that particular back and forth, but by the time I got further into the discussion with all of them, you could tell they were buying into the concept and 3rd Law is notoriously difficult to get kids to *believe* is really true.

Anyways. For a little while there I had one of those fun classes where it feels like you're actually reaching them and they are enjoying being there with you.My physics kids are at their lab tables working on a project when suddenly there is a bright blue flash and loud pop.

I look over at the source and one of my kids is sitting there with a pair of scissors and a now severed power cord to the table's laptop in his hand. He looks surprised.

I tell him to freeze because he is holding a live wire. Don't. Move. I'm serious kid, freeze, because he is starting trying to make excuses and I don't want him letting that exposed wire touch anything. I unplug it.

What does he say? 

""I didn't realize it was plugged in.""
 
Oh! Because *THAT* makes it better....I'm so sad. I just found out one of my sweetest students moved away and won't be coming back to our school. 

Her mom decided spur of the moment to move out of state with her boyfriend and packed them up in the middle of the night to leave. The student never returned from winter break. Her friends have been asking me about her all week because she hasn't been returning their phone calls or texts. I just found out today when I had to sign her withdrawal forms. So, now when the kids ask I'll have to deal with responding to their questions appropriately and respecting the girl's privacy. Clearly, if she's not responding to her friends' messages she's not thrilled about what is going on.

Student is very conscientious. She struggles sometimes, but tries hard, always comes for extra help and is super appreciative of her teachers. She's kind and empathetic to everyone around her. She's just one of those people who goes out of her way to be supportive of others, even when you can tell she's tired, or sick, or dealing with something else.

:/

I'm just sad to see her life disrupted like this. She deserves better."

A post was made here a couple weeks ago for the reveal trailer of the Rollcage spiritual successor, GRIP ([See here](http://www.cagedelement.com/grip/)). I remembered it today and thought I would play the original games for some nostalgia and while looking if they run on Windows 7, I came across [Rollcage Redux](http://www.codemonkey.me.uk/rollcage_redux.php) and [Rollcage Extreme](http://codemonkey.me.uk/rollcage_extreme.php). These are Rollcage and Rollcage: Stage II respectively, with many bug fixes and improvements like HD and UHD resolution options, updated by one of the original developers. 

Both of these games can also be played online and they have multiplayer games every Saturday. Their [Steam Community Page](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rollcage) has all the details and more.

PoopyMcpants,5,3,"His latest is a video about Poisons Fundamentals.

https://youtu.be/dVb4B9vPUpII've noticed a lot of things in common with the people on this show, as such, I put together a list of what I hear vs what I think they actually mean.

I havent been perfect OR I've cheated here and there OR I've been trying to diet: I haven't been dieting at all.


I've been trying to get up and move more: I haven't been exercising at all.


I have a lot of water weight: I havent been dieting and know I've gained so I need a quick excuse.


I lost the papers: I dont want to diet and that's a good excuse. 


I don't understand why I've gained: I know I gained weight but if I act like I dont understand I'll get sympathy.


I've done my hardest: I havent tried.


I know how to lose weight on my own and I don't need to be in the program: I don't want to lose weight anymore or do anything that takes effort so I'm going to go eat myself to death.

I cant walk because I hurt too bad: I want pain meds and they won't give them to me, so I'll try to leverage them.

Ow! Muh leg! : Ow! Muh leg!She's supposed to be 18 weeks along, but the measurements were only reading 14 weeks. The ultrasound tech couldn't find a heartbeat either.

We are going in tonight to have surgery to remove the remains.

InSight is a robotic lander designed to study the interior structure of the planet, using a variety of instruments including a seismometer and a 5m long heat flow sensor that will be drilled into the rock below the lander.  It carries instruments from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, German Aerospace Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory,  Centro de Astrobiología (Spain), and  Italian Space Agency.

#Watch live

The InSight landing will be streamed live on NASA's website and youtube channel.  This will be a control room stream similar to the Curiosity landing stream, not live footage from the spacecraft.

GBBL,5,7,"Title says all. My roomie of 11 months who owes me over 500 dollars threw a glass of milk at my face and kicked me in the stomach. I called the police and they mediated a solution where she signed an agreement to pay me back in full (enforceable through small claims) and then I went to Thailand to see my girl.

She was a German exchange student (I live in LA) and we hit it off immediately. We’ve been separated for months and when we finally met up again she didn’t feel the same and dumped me. But like...I feel amazing.

I feel like I’ve finally cut the fat out of my life. My small business is picking up, my acting career is going amazing (adidas commercial, and over 200 mil views on vids I’ve been in in the last year) and I’m here in Thailand eating my favorite food. I thought I’d be dying about now, but I moved on and am just super happy and grateful for how my life has worked out and I am just so ready to see my friends and get this business making a LOT of money (after I eat all the food I can ram into my belly obvi)

TLDR my life kinda fell apart but i feel better than ever

Edit: I wanted to say thank you to everyone who replied. I never got to talk about this the way I have in the last few hours and its been really helpful to work through it all properly. I really appreciate you all!It’s so tempting to take a look at the portfolio when you wake up in the middle of the night. It’s been such a long time and the phone is right there. Please don’t do it. You won’t go back to sleep.

Phones emit blue light which tells your body it’s tome to wake up. Plus the dopamine reward we get for checking our portfolio is going to provide a surge of energy that will jar you out of your sleep.

When we’re tired, we make crap decisions. Sell Bitcoin for the shitcoin that’s pumping, sure why not. Trade all my ETH for ERC 20s. Sure. This game is hard enough as is and you need your brain in top condition to win.

If you’re gonna check this at night, make sure you have night shift or a blue light filter enabled in your phone. It’s not perfect but it’ll help you stay sleepy.

What a weird drug, I think im gonna experiment with sobriety this week. 
Hi all. My roommate is physically violent and financially abusive. She has stated that she will not sign the required paperwork to end our lease, my other roommate and I have already given our 30 days notice. The landlord is saying that if she does not sign the paperwork we will automatically renew for another year of the lease. 

Do I have any recourse here? I am not interested in punishing the roommate, I simply want to leave and not be financially shackled to her for another year.She doesn't have a lot of money and i'm fairly well off. I paid the deposit when we moved in, we had a conversation about her paying me back within the month. Its been 5 months and I've given her multiple extensions. 

This isnt a post about how to get my money back though, I just dont know how to talk to her. When we text about bills, cleaning, or any roommate business she will invariably focus on some small thing I said and call me rude and mean for talking to her like that (example, I tried to set April 5th as a day we could have a meeting about a payment plan, and she said that I was rude for confirming a date she had already said yes to) 

She communicates a lot using emotional language and emotional arguments and I just dont know how to talk to her. I'm at the end of my rope and just want to go a month without fighting about the bills. Any advice?

Edit: Thanks so much to everybody who replied. Its so funny how we lose context on whats happening in our own lives. I'm ready to eat the money and just move on with my life. Luckily its only a few hundred and I budget for losing that kind of money every year. I feel better already and will be moving out at my earliest convinience. "
DevelopThePrograms,10,4,"OK so I'm about 60 hours in, at the windy city of winged people. I used to have multi-heal but I no longer have it since my healing party member left. My other characters are not on the path to Sage at all, so to get it back it would take hours and hours of vocation leveling! 

It's the first boss I lost at (besides battles that you are supposed to lose in the story) because he attacks with a group spell that does b/t 35 and 50 damage to each player, then attacks once more for more damage. The best I have is Midheal from 2 characters but if I used that every turn I only have 2 characters to attack with, and no Oomph or Sap spells. 

What can I do at this point? To be honest I'm pretty pissed that this important party member left, whom I was depending on for the group heal spell.I was reading about the development of DQii in Japan, and it said that they didn't have battery backed up saving until it was released in the USA as Dragon Warrior ii.  They used passwords to continue the game. For a role playing game this sounds crazy, does anyone know how this worked and how long the passwords were? The password would have to incorporate all the players inventory, stats, the location, and all events that occurred so far."

* **yumiao79 (郁苗)** ( [twitter](https://twitter.com/yumiao79) ) I went on the PTR to try out Sym's beam and mess around with the new Workshop things (dummy bots and beam effects specifically) and saw that the holiday maps were available! I went back to live to check and they're not they're yet. Blizz said they were looking into adding them, so I think today's patch did so!


Every holiday map is available (Winter, Halloween, Lunar New Year). But the following maps aren't: specifically the Junkenstein map and the Archives variants of Havana/Rialto/King's Row.

--------------------

EDIT: Yes, Winter Black Forest and Winter Ecopoint: Antarctica are available. But it looks like Halloween Chateau and Lunar New Year Busan Downtown are not, unfortunately. Those two were the most recent they made, so maybe that's why?


EDIT 2: My bad, I forgot that the Capture the Flag maps tend to be at different times of day and such already. Busan is like this and is not missing. It doesn't have a specific special holiday variant. So that means Halloween Chateau is the single missing map, eh?

--------------------

Halloween Eichenwalde has Junkenstein covered anyhow, I was just kinda hoping the small segmented section was available. People could do some fun Workshop things with it. I was also hoping that stormy Havana might be available, since of all the Archives map variants it's the closest to the normal playable map, but alas.


I didn't check but I assume no Lucioball maps are available."

Also, despite not having any popular counter picks, I can't remember the last time I saw Ornn being played. I guess I expected more.

Blizzard launcher announcement about end of season 21, however the related [forum link](https://us.diablo3.com/en-us/blog/23428368/season-21-trials-of-tempests-is-now-live-6-4-2020?blzcmp=app) doesn't currently address this.Consider a society where advertisement isn't legal. Product information is fine but must be formal and should have to be accessed - not pushed into someone's consciousness. The sole purpose of new ads is to describe formal information about products, but without any degree of psychological influence.

Some products, artificially promoted as ""good"" will no longer be perceived as good (KFC, McDonalds, Batman vs Superman, iGadgets, cars, holiday destinations etc). While products genuinely of quality (craftman's work, and products with *durability*) will actually become available and popular without being overshadowed by big companies aggressive marketing.

The sole purpose of most ads can be boiled down to: *Making you realize that your life would be better with ___ [product]*. Advertisement shapes society into doing weird shit because money... (shaving body hair, using lotion, applying oils, using nail polish, using perfume, using make-up, using hair-gel, using segways, getting a watch with the same functions as the phone in your pocket. this list is non-exhaustive) 

Advertisement breeds on peoples greed and makes people buy, buy, buy and toss away shit that could otherwise be used. Yeah, I'm talking about the environment. I know that advertisement is a major reason our current economic system works (people buy shit so other people can make shit and earn money, and buy shit) and without it - our consuming behaviour would probably be changed. Is that our biggest concern? Is consumerism IMPORTANT? Hell no, it's a fucking culprit of evil and the reason we're not happy despite being lucky af. People, interaction, *doing*^(not buying) stuff we value - is what makes you happy (I started studying psychology because I was like wtf is happiness, if you're like me, striving for happiness - stop doing that shit, [it makes you unhappy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/positive-prescription/201603/backfire-is-the-pursuit-happiness-making-you-unhappy)). Getting that product you didn't even know you needed (Literally reversing the disequilibration that advertisement artificially implemented in your life) does not make you happy, it just puts you back at where you started. 

So... Making a society void of influencing advertisement would be one of my three wishes. WCGW? 

PS: If you are able to see this in light of a 4^th industrial revolution, how would this affect an automised society. i.e. one where robots are increasingly doing jobs where [Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)? (Unemploymentrates rising way above 20%)

Does it improve the experience of the game, or is it a well-intended disservice? 

What are the benefits of bypassing all the gameplay of gearing up?

Isn't the season rather easy to complete? I've been playing piano for 14 years but stopped taking lessons 3 years ago. My background is mostly classical without professional experience. 

I'm going into my final year of my Psychology BSc and am in a serious need for income. I was hoping I could combine playing the piano with working so I get time for both (in addition to studies). 

I'm planning on asking around for work in the following:

- Riverside coffebar, wooden, small room atmosphere

- Semi-fancy british restaurant/bar provided with a medium sized grand piano

- Nearby 'Holiday inn' hotel with a lobby+restaurant+reception area provided with a piano.

&nbsp;

#My repertoire

**Classical**

Chopin *Nocturne E-Flat Major op 9 no 2*

Chopin *Nocturne G Minor op 15 no 3*

Chopin *Nocturne G Minor op 37 no 1*

Chopin *Nocturne F Minor op 55 no 1*

Chopin *Nocturne C-Sharp Minor no 20 Oeuvre postume*

Chopin *Prelude Raindrop* 

Chopin *Prelude E Minor*

Chopin *Waltz C-Sharp Minor Op 64 no 7*

Debussy *Arabesque, No 1. E Major*

Debussy *Clair De Lune*

Debussy *La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin*

Satie *Gnossiennes*

Schubert *Ave Maria*

Bach *Air* 

Bach *Ave Maria*

Beethoven *Moonlight Sonata 1 (& 2) mov.*

Beethoven *Pathetique C Minor op 13 no 8*

Beethoven *Für Elise*

**Relaxing/Contemporary**

Yann Tiersen - Amélie songs

Yiruma - 4-6 songs 

Ludovico Einaudi - 3-4 songs

++ couple more similar

**Pop/rock/ etc**

I like and can prepare music like beatles, elton john, billy joel in no time.

I'm not comfortable with playing by ear (haven't practiced this in years).

I can play anything I've heard before from fakebooks, but struggle with memorising pop songs (the chords & song structure). 

I find my piano pop music gets kind of boring over time since I never experienced and improvised much with songs and I find the 4chords vers-ref-vers-ref.... gets stale. (I've seen a lot of pianists doing wonders with simple songs, I don't know if I can myself) 

**Jazz**

I play Autumn Leaves, Misty, All of Me, Georgia etc, but my repertoire is limited to mainstream jazz at best. 

#Approach

How do I approach the staff about wanting to play there? (They aren't looking - I am) I've seen some people suggesting just having a go at the piano, but I feel I should talk to a manager etc first.

Someone said not to offer to play for free at first (which I thought could be a good way 'in') because its difficult to transition into pay later, but what can I charge? I'm **not** a professional, but I am confident that I can play at a 'background-music'-level without scaring off customers =P haha. 


I am also considering teaching or playing for churches/choir if this presents more opportunities. 

Thank you for any advise! "

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the kind responses! She is so happy reading all the support!I was invading Lothric Castle with my Sword Master cosplay as usual, but I came across a curious character in one of my attempts. He was called ""Harmless"".

Of course, I predicted the Giant Seed right away, and fended off the mobs until I got to a bonfire. He sent a bit of a condescending invite to a certain group that may or may not have the words ""git gud"" in it, but I figured he was just feeling threatened.

I add him on steam, and tell him I'm waiting by the bonfire, and congratulate his 10/10 cosplay. We finally meet, and I see he is completely naked, with just a talisman on him (I assume for healing). I'm now in a moral dilemma, as my honor as a sword master cannot let me simply kill a defenseless man. But then a wonderful idea struck me on how we could settle this.

A grand race, where the victor survives, and the defeated opponent takes his own life.

So we agreed. Once the thrown firebomb exploded, the race would begin. The first combatant to get to the Dragonslayer Armour fog wall shall be victorious.

The harmless man masterfully weaved through all the enemies, and twists and turns of the castle. By quite a margin, I was bested by him. I congratulated him on his skillful triumph, pull out my bloodlust, and performed harakiri, as it befits a man bested at his own game.

May we meet another day, Harmless, so I could again try my hand (or better said, foot) at defeating you.

TL;DR don't kill, race to the death, race starts with firebomb explosion, loser kills himselfBasically the title. I visited the subreddit, excited for new patch, only to see everyone completely pissed. And for a reason. But the bugs will be fixed, the thing that won't be fixed is the premium downgrade. One of my main hype points to show to friends about gwent was stuff like [this draug premium](https://gwent.one/video/card/premium/132101.webm), but now it looks like a messy, pixelated joke. None of the fog effects are there, the fire is a fire gif effect you see on joke montages, and you can see pixels everywhere. I was hoping my favourite premium was untouched, but it looks like everything is downgraded.

So we're just supposed to stand there, despite a lot of us paying for meteorite powder to craft these, just to realize they've been made WORSE THAN THE NON PREMIUMS, and we don't even have a way to revert them back? And the biggest insult of all, the downgrade was mentioned NOWHERE in any patch notes.

Shame on you, CDPR. I thought you were better than stooping this low. I'm never spending another penny on this mobile game PC port again. I know better now.

EDIT: I dunno when Reinforcements were changed exactly, but I was thinking when I got the premium recently that it is the worst looking premium in the game.

See video description for what I'm doing step by step.

This method will likely take you a couple times coming to the system so you can properly identify the orbit of the station along with using astronomical objects behind the planet/station to assist in verifying the proper 45 degree approach.

Also if you approach the station from the wrong 45 degree angle you will be facing exactly the side of the station.  Make sure you were aware of your approach so next time you come to the station you approach from the opposite orbit side of the station.

It's a little convoluted, but when trying to describe the specific supercruise approach to allow directly facing the entrance of an orbiting object orbiting another object possibly orbiting another object... it will be convoluted.

I hope people with get this and understand my MS PAINT prowess.

Edit: Noticed I typed astrological and not astronomical... fixed. shame on me

Edit 2: I'm not talking about just facing the station, I'm talking about directly facing the mailslot straight-on with almost zero correction.

1C3M4Nz,1,7,"Best cosplay I've seen - http://i.imgur.com/Wjadwi8.gifv

Video - https://www.facebook.com/DATgermia/videos/1772355859691904/Few people wanted to get a screenshot so I just have a 1920x1080 image without HUD (toggle using CTRL+Z in game)

Enjoy - http://i.imgur.com/scONEma.pngAna is not automatically better than Mercy if you can't play her well. This has happened so many times in comp that I thought I'd ask if anyone else has seen it. 

I've had close to 5 games where a person picking Ana does a bad job. I'm not talking about landing pro sleep darts on ulting Soldier or Genji or grenading enemies to block their enemy heals - which is part of why Ana is amazing tbh, but talking about Ana's on my team not being able to aim and heal the team and wasting grenades. I have seen the DPS Ana far too often when they go into the front lines and fight when team is down 3-4 people. Surprise surprise, they get murdered. Talking about support positioning could be it's own topic so let's not even get into that now.

You could ask me how I would get to know that a friendly Ana is bad - it's really obvious when the tanks are not getting healed and you see grenades being chucked and exploding over the corner into no man's land. A bad support just like a bad DPS or bad Tank costs you the game, no doubt about it. I've played with and against amazing Ana's to know the level of impact that a good Ana can have on the game.

Worst of all and the most tilting experience is when asked to switch to Mercy, they say ""I don't know how to play Mercy"" or ""Mercy is not that good"". Every hero has a role, if you are not doing good DPS or support or tank switch it up. If you want to learn the hero do it in QP not competitive. Bad supports don't get called out as much as bad DPSs to be honest. I would rather have the option of taking over support if you can't play that role well. Thoughts?

Edit 1: fixed some typos. 

I should have probably titled the post ""Mercy isn't bad"". It's easy to get carried away seeing the posts asking for Mercy buffs or pointing out how amazing Ana is. But you gotta take your skill into account. Mercy is auto lock on consistent healer and is easier to heal with than Ana. And no it's not an insult to play Mercy over Ana. There's no weird self worth at stake here over your skill. It's like saying everyone should play Zarya cause she's amazing vs an auto aim hero like Winston, bad example as they are different roles but you get the idea. A good mercy beats out an average Ana easily. A team not dying is the best outcome and whoever guarantees that at a higher probability wins best healer for me. "

Synectics,8,4,"**TL;DR Version:** I made custom drinking glasses for my group of buddies, based on our [WACK] CoD clan tag. 

The step-by-step album: http://imgur.com/a/4xMTcSo here I am, nothing to do. I just got done fucking up some Lost, Lil' Chen and his puppet boy are all pissy over my *protecting them*, Wade is off sucking dick, and Ron is... well, who knows. Probably getting his dick sucked by Wade.

Time to cruise. I hop on the ATV and hit the highway for what feels like the first time in a long time. Why an ATV, you ask? Because **fuck you, that's why.** 

At first, I'm pretty impressed by all the traffic on the road. I mean, it's late at night, and this road is packed tighter than Wade's ass. But no problem. This ATV handles great, and hell, keeps up to speed with everyone.

Just when I think my inane cruising will become a fruitless endeavor, I see it: a boat. A big, sexy, hard-as-my-cock boat, carried by a big-ass truck.

For a moment, I consider my one and only (and obvious) option -- whip my four-wheel beauty up in front of the truck, crank the brakes, ignore the driver's babbling, shoot him in **the fucking face**, throw him out, check his phone, call his wife, tell her I'll be there soon to bang her in **the fucking face**, hop in the truck, cruise that bad boy to the ocean, drop her in, and add yet another form of transport to Trevor Phillips Enterprises. 

But then it hits me like a cock in the ass. What if... what if I just... *follow* this truck? What if I get a little patient, cruise behind this fuck, and wait for him to get the boat to the ocean *for me?* I can let this dumb fuck back the truck up, get the boat in the water, hell, maybe even start the engine... and *then* I can shoot him. This has the added bonus of not having to wipe brain goo out of the truck later!

Well fuck me, maybe I *can* function off of meth.

So I continue to cruise along behind this rich fuck, flipping off anyone dumb enough to honk at me for having the audacity to enjoy the open breeze of the highway on an ATV. This guy continues right along, taking a path off the highway and heading through one of those shit towns I already forget the name of. 

That's when fate intervened, in the form of two big dumb deer. 

They hop right out in front of truck. And Mr. Shit-For-Brains doesn't even brake. Maybe he was too busy watching homo porn on his phone to pay attention. First deer? Makes it clean across. Second one? ...well, he fucking hits it. That dumb fucking deer rolls under his first tire, and what does the genius do? He stops. He stops on a couple hundred pounds of what could turn into some damn good jerky. 

And then, he backs up. Of course, the rest of the fucking road's occupants can't see what the fuck is going on. I whip the four-wheel beasty onto the desert sand and watch as this fucker backs **my new fucking boat** into some spic's low rider.

Well, wouldn't you know it. The homie in the low rider is a gang member. And he has three other homies with him. They all hop out, fucking *strapped.* And they unleash hell on this poor fuck. I mean, I sort of feel bad for him. I at least would have just put one in his fucking skull. But these guys rip him hundreds of new ones everywhere *but* his head.

Rich pants is dead at the wheel. The truck is now decorated with bullet holes. The boat is dinged up. And homies are already hopping back in their car to drive off.

The cops are on the horizon, and there's no way I could get in the truck and out run them. Besides, who wants to sit in brain goop? I don't mind the mess, but fuck, I can't stand to sit on a mess like that. Last time I shit my pants, I tried to just ignore it, but you know, it bothers you eventually. It's not the smell, but the texture on your ass.

Anyway. I crank the ATV and ride off into the rising sun. I got meth to cook.So a friend and I share the same month for our birthdays, and we usually throw a big party to celebrate both of our birthdays at the same time. This year, being a bit broke, we decided to have a big Blops2 party. Since we usually all play at his place anyway, we figured we can get all our tvs and consoles together and, instead of playing online, we can play a bunch of custom game types against each other.So what are some fun custom gametypes to play with friends? Drinking will be involved as well, so any type of Blops2 drinking games are encouraged as well. Our first ideas were having to drink if you go negative, or if you get knifed, stuff like that.I liked the idea of TDM where kills net two points, dying costs one point, and headshot kills net an extra point. Hardpoint with only grenades and knives sounded good too. Anyone have some interesting ones? "
FapsAllTheTime,1,6,"Typically I wouldn't consider this to be anything important if it was a one-time thing, but this is two weeks in a row that Meltzer has mentioned that The Rock is seriously considering running for president. He spent a solid two-three minutes on it this week, saying how cool it would be that he might be friends with a future president, and that he could tell the president to watch this tape or that. Both Meltzer and Alvarez noted that Dwayne is a great talker (obviously), and very smart, and *good at politics.*

EDIT: Just to clarify, I think Meltzer meant Johnson is very good at politicking in the WWE (something Punk also mentioned, plus  you don't just get to be Vince's favorite wrestler ever without some political skill). Obviously he's got no experience in actual politics, but after this election, that's clearly not in the minimum requirements for the job.

Alvarez was super tickled by it, but I don't think Dave was just being funny there.

The term ""indie"" is used a little loosely here. Please forgive me.

[**Bernice - Passenger Plane**](https://open.spotify.com/track/2iFgaiCTkxJhv4Bxc7z5o0)

*""There's a puffed edge hiding behind this glow, like your love passing through, foggy and steady and slow.""*

Endearing in its difference, the sound of Bernice is a patient and atmospheric one. As endearing and imperfect as it is nostalgic and warm, it moves at a pace and in waves not fit for everyone, but especially intimate for someone like myself who adores the visions a song like this can create.

[**Champagne Superchillin' - Beach Deep**](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ovZtNReJSRB6SFsHO4iOP)

Not my favorite song off of this band's newest album, but one of their more accessible and cool. Psychedelic and strange, Melody's Echo Chamber might be the most appropriate comparison but still slightly off from describing the full appeal to Champagne Superchillin'. Consider this song a sampler for weirder things to come.

[**Polaris - Nocturne**](https://open.spotify.com/track/10HmsPCxB0cP3dsxLV1iNR)

A comfortable and colorful track from Polaris, a Japanese duo that's been putting out music since 2001. You might best remember one half of the duo, Yuzuru Kashiwabara, for being the bassist of the legendary group Fishmans. Polaris doesn't achieve that degree of quality, but they continue the legacy of the group in their own way.

[**yakokoala - bullet trains**](https://youtu.be/lngxieTC3mk)

*""Your life is short so you must surround yourself with people that won't bring you down.""*

With presumably no budget and confusing degrees of talent, Bullet Trains is still somehow the greatest song of all time.

[**Re-TROS - Red Rum Aviv**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4FPMnmTtyI7xBrXUUwouqv)

One of my favorite albums of last year came from this Chinese post-punk group absolutely crushing any of my expectations with a tracklist as varied as anything you might get from the genre. Many of the songs go for as long as twelve minutes, but Red Rum Aviv clocks in at just five and a half, and serves as a good earlier indicator to if this group might be for you. It's abstract, and it's oddly danceable. Like most of the record, actually.

[**Mimicking Birds - Great Wave**](https://open.spotify.com/track/5llu7shSX78b8UyXOCoXXp)

*""Here in the moment I am somewhere else, drifting through current eternity. This strained old world was once ice I believe. All that's left of it now is the flood line.""*

I expected Mimicking Birds to blow up in attention following the release of their incredible new album Layers of Us. Instead it kept to their usual degree of popularity, despite shades of a restrained Animal Collective. Psychedelia layering in atmosphere to an unbelievable size and gorgeous melodies. 

[**The Yossarians - Caramelised**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4leVHyltZ6iyfFvFmJ6WG6)

*""Come and kill me once again.""*

I will repeatedly defend my stance that The Yossarians are one of the best rock bands in the world right now. It's a hard stance to keep up completely, though, considering how many more like them will never get their due attention. But if you want something a little further underground, with the intensity of the finest in modern day rock music, The Yossarians will provide.

[**Sophia Kennedy - Baltimore**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0T8MpgH1gBCkuP7oI77jvJ)

*""Do you remember me?""*

Signed to DJ Koze's record label and featured on his newest album, Sophia Kennedy's self-titled record was still unfairly ignored by most despite some stunning deep cuts like the biting William by the Windowsill, or the gorgeous track listed above. Her voice takes some time to get used to, but her songwriting is above and beyond some more popular artists going down a similar lane. 

[**Park Day - Bicycle**](https://open.spotify.com/track/4m107UYSEPfHf1ZD8LoALZ)

*""Give me back my bicycle, you thief!""*

My own local scene is more often than not dominated by comfy but sometimes derivative folk music. Park Day, like Fog Lake before them, isn't going to capture the ears of the city like the traditional artists do, but they remain one of the most exciting groups from this side of the country. 

[**Small Leaks Sink Ships - Creepin'**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3RLdY5TDtlFDrnq870BBFz)

*""I don't even know you.""*

With a past leaning in genres like math rock, Small Leaks Sink Ships go in a different and more accessible direction with tracks like Creepin'. Nevertheless, in the difference from their older material, their ability in variance is made incredibly clear. Their abilities they picked up in other genres serve as a detail to their new sound, and it all culminates quite stunningly in a song like this.

Be sure to tell me what you think of the songs, the bands, or even just let us know some other various recommendations you want to share.ahahaSo, I hear /r/movies is getting more into Tarkovsky, now. As an arthouse fan, this excites me, so I wanted to make it easier for you guys to approach his filmography. I haven't seen all of his films, but I'll try my best to give you guys the general consensus on what to expect.

**[The Killers (1956)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052330/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_12)** and **[There Will Be No Leave Today (1959)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053258/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_11)** 

---

*Two men besiege a lunch bar looking for a third man they must kill.*

*Soldiers undertake the perilous task of removing a stockpile of World War II bombshells discovered during roadworks under the ground of a small village.*

These were student short films by Tarkovsky, as well as Aleksandr Gordon (for both) and Marika Beiku (for The Killers only). Both are considered to be early successes, but nothing incredible. The Killers is based off the Hemingway novel of the same name, and clocks in at about twenty minutes, with There Will Be No Leave Today lasting 45 minutes. More for Tarkovsky completionists, but not bad by any means. (Unlike [Kubrick's early work.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045758/))

**[The Steamroller and the Violin (1961)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053987/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_10)**

----

*Seven year old Sasha practices violin every day to satisfy the ambition of his parents. Already withdrawn as a result of his routines, Sasha quickly regains confidence when he accidentally meets and befriends worker Sergei, who works on a steamroller in their upscale Moscow neighborhood.*

Tarkovsky's earliest film as the sole director, and despite being lesser known than most of his other work, it does have its fans for being an admirable early film from the director. This is also notable for being Tarkovsky's diploma film, in which he earned top marks for.

**[Ivan's Childhood (1962)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056111/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_9)**

------

*In WW2, twelve year old Soviet orphan Ivan Bondarev works for the Soviet army as a scout behind the German lines and strikes a friendship with three sympathetic Soviet officers.*

And here comes Tarkovsky's first unanimously agreed masterpiece, a gorgeous and terrifying depiction of war through the eyes of a child. Essential viewing. 

Ivan's Childhood was ranked by TSPDT #370 on their list of the [greatest films of all time.](http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php)

**[Andrei Rublev (1966)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060107/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_8)**

-----

*The life, times and afflictions of the fifteenth-century Russian iconographer.*

While Ivan's Childhood was Tarkovsky's first masterpiece, Andrei Rublev would showcase what his films would grow to be, philosophical, slow-paced, and mind-blowing in their discussions and their tactics. Some consider it to be Tarkovsky's greatest.

Andrei Rublev was ranked by TSPDT #26 on their list of the greatest films of all time.

**[Solaris (1972)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069293/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_7)**

-----

*A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane.*

Insanely ambitious work by Tarkovsky, where he uses the setting of space to help themes of isolation and alienation shine through much better. Those expecting a conventional sci-fi will be disappointed, but if you're looking for a less show-y, more humanist 2001: A Space Odyssey, you got your wish. Possibly Tarkovsky's most creative film.

Solaris was ranked by TSPDT #204 on their list of the greatest films of all time.

**[Mirror (1975)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072443/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_6)**

------

*A dying man in his forties remembers his past. His childhood, his mother, the war, personal moments and things that tell of the recent history of all the Russian nation.*

While films like Ivan's Childhood and Solaris have earned comparisons to Stanley Kubrick, Mirror is very much a Terrence Malick type film, and while it may be less accessible than some of Tarkovsky's other films, it actually isn't a long film, being less than two hours. This one is another in contention for Tarkovsky's best.

Mirror was ranked by TSPDT #28 on their list of the greatest films of all time.

**[Stalker (1979)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_5)**

----

*A guide leads two men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.*

This film and Solaris may be Tarkovsky's most popular work, and for good reason. They aren't accessible on paper, as they're both incredibly long, but they deal in brilliant ideas and grow almost hypnotic despite their slow pacing. Stalker remains the only Tarkovsky film on the IMDb Top 250. So this is often the starter point for deciding whether or not you'll enjoy Tarkovsky.

Stalker was ranked by TSPDT #57 on their list of the greatest films of all time.

**[Nostalghia (1983)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086022/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_2)**

-----

*The Russian poet Andrei Gorchakov, accompanied by guide and translator Eugenia, is traveling through Italy researching the life of an 18th-century Russian composer.*

Not as often called one of Tarkovsky's best, it still receives universal acclaim, despite being one of his slowest moving films, regardless of its two hour runtime. It is also home for one of the greatest final shots in film history. Don't make this your first Tarkovsky, but it's nevertheless essential.

Nostalghia was ranked by TSPDT #347 on their list of the greatest films of all time.

**[The Sacrifice (1986)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091670/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1)**

-----

*At the dawn of World War III, a man searches for a way to restore peace to the world and finds he must give something in return.*

For a director who looked so often into either the distant past or the distant future, his final film looks towards a war that still hasn't happened yet, to once again battle his philosophical ideas. Oddly enough, this film was largely produced in Sweden, yet it does not suffer any drawbacks from a possible cultural shift.

The Sacrifice was ranked by TSPDT #301 on their list of the greatest films of all time.

*Ivan's Childhood* may be his most accessible film, however, it wont necessarily prepare you for the style of film Tarkovsky takes on in his later films. It does share commonalities with other Soviet filmmakers of the time, however, like Larisa Shepitko (The Ascent) and Elem Klimov (Come and See).

*Andrei Rublev* is a long one, and possibly boring if you aren't accustomed to his style. It bears a lot of resemblance, however, to the work of Bela Tarr (Satantango), so if you're fond of his films, this may be an easier one to jump into.

*Solaris* is not your average sci-fi film, so do not expect something along those lines. Expect something claustrophobic and otherworldly, maybe something along the lines of the original Alien film, but even slower, and with no action.

*Mirror* is an introspective film, but it may be divisive to modern audiences. If you enjoy Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, this will be perfect for you, otherwise, make this possibly your third or fourth film from Tarkovsky, so you're already warmed up.

*Stalker* is distraught, slow, but mesmerizing and with a wonderful concept that is fun to think about. If the runtime or the idea of slow cinema as a whole doesn't immediately turn you off, this is probably the best place to start!

*Nostalghia* is probably not the best place to start. At least wait until after Andrei Rublev to give this one a shot, but you have to be prepared for this one. If you're a diehard Tarkovsky fan, this will be a new challenge that you'll adore.

*The Sacrifice* is certainly a better place to begin than Nostalghia, but I'd still leave it until after you've viewed his earlier films. Watching a director's last film first is not usually recommended if you have a choice.

dysgraphical,8,7,"Yikes. 

This is especially awkward considering the top post on the our frontpage right now is a TorrentFreak article citing my best efforts to curb away copyright infringement on this community. Lets get down to what's going on.


#Who?
On March 14th (9:26 PM UTC) we received a modmail from a Reddit Admin with the following message. 

>Dear Moderators,

>TL;DR: This is an official warning from Reddit that we are receiving too many copyright infringement notices about material posted to your community. We will be required to ban this community if you can't adequately address the problem.

>First, some background.

>1. Redditors aren't allowed to submit material that infringes someone else's copyrights.
>2. We (the Reddit admins) are required by law to process notices from people who say that material on Reddit violates their copyrights. The process is described in the DMCA section of the Reddit User Agreement.
>3. The law also requires us to issue bans in cases of repeat infringement. Sometimes a repeat infringement problem is limited to just one user and we ban just that person. Other times the problem pervades a whole community and we ban the community.

>This is our formal warning about repeat infringement in this community. Over the past months we've had to remove material from the community in response to copyright notices 74 times. That's an unusually high number taking into account the community's size.

>Every community is different, but here are some general suggestions.

>1. Consider whether your community's rules encourage or tolerate infringing content, and revise if necessary to be more clear.
>2. Actively enforce your community's rules. If you need help, recruit more moderators to help.
>3. Remove any existing infringing content from your community so Reddit doesn't get new notices about past content.
If you can't adequately address the problem, we'll have to ban the community.

>Sincerely, Reddit Legal

#What?
This was my initial response to the modmail. Reddit Legal states that they have acted 74 times on these copyright notices through removals, but it is the first time we have been officially contacted regarding any infringement where it be through modmail or PMs. Considering our stringent rules against distributing pirated content through this platform, it is unclear what constitutes *copyright infringement* to Reddit or whether the simple mention of a release name falls under their broad interpretation. Another issue with this is that as moderators, we do not have the ability to see when a user or Admin deletes content. While ""admins*"" show up as a moderator in our moderation logs, there are 0 actions listed. This means that Admins can remove content at their own discretion and leave behind no notice or log for moderators. We cannot take any precautionary or preventative measures if we do not know what was removed.

#Where?

As of now, we are unaware where all these infringements took place. Were they regular posts? Crossposts? Comments? PMs? We reached out via email inquiring on the most recent DMCA notices and Reddit's Legal Support replied:

>Hello,

>The most recent DMCA notices we processed (which led to the removal of content from your community) came from Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.

>Regards,

>Reddit Legal Support

We replied immediately requesting a list of offending material that was removed and have not received a reply yet.


#When? Why?

Reddit Legal states that these repeated infringements occurred ""over the past months"" but the timeline isn't concrete in helping us analyze when it occurred and through what means. It is also convenient that Reddit has permitted this number of DMCA notices to accumulate without reaching out to us at all. Had Reddit warned us earlier, we would have had ample time to revisit our current rules or make adjustments on what sort of content is permitted. 

&nbsp;

---

#What now?

It has become abundantly clear in the past months and years that Reddit has never been the bastion of freedom that many people see it as. The many subreddit purges that have occurred in the past few days further confirm it. Reddit's passivity in enforcing its own rules is continuously tested whenever one of its subreddits are thrusted into the limelight by the media. As we wait for more information from Reddit Legal, there is one certainty that comes from all of this,

r/Piracy will be banned. 

It is a matter of when. While we continue moderating the community to the best of our ability, should Reddit continue expanding its definition of copyright infringement and blindly react to every false copyright notice, this community's days are counted - not just us, but the many other related communities that openly permit the discussion of digital piracy or encourage it. 


We will continue communicating with Reddit Legal in hopes that we can identify what content broken infringement but it would be naive to expect this will be the last time we hear from them. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

azarel23,4,1,"I was involved in a road rage incident and assault in May. I was interviewed on a national Australian current affairs program about road rage as a result.

I am 63 years old. I hold a first degree black belt in Jiu Jitsu, and instructor qualifications in a TMA. My training in martial arts and self defence worked for me very well to stop me from being seriously injured, but not in the way some might expect.

This post details the event and its aftermath from a personal and self defence perspective. I have another blog post about the TV program itself and the events leading up to it which I will link to here at a later time if people are interested.

> Dear Instructors and athletes,

> Please read the important note regarding Kids No Gi Events.

> In line with the accepted International governing body, the IBJJF, the AFBJJ wishes to follow and not allow No Gi categories for Juniors.

> The IBJJF believes and the AFBJJ agrees that No Gi at Junior levels is a poor foundation for Jiu Jitsu.

> Further after consultation with peak insurance bodies, it was established that liability may be evident in Junior No Gi categories, as the International body does not promote them.

> The AFBJJ wishes to fall in line with the IBJJF and not offer nor support No Gi categories for Juniors.

> It can be noted that Juvenile categories (they are those for athletes that turn either 16 or 17 in the said competition year) are allowed.

> We trust that you understand that this is in the best interests of the children's development and safety.

I can't find any reference to this decision on the IBJJF website or anywhere else with Google.

Does anyone know any more about this?

UPDATE: My coach has confirmed it is legit. He will be discontinuing kid's no gi in his comps (Events BJJ) in NSW (Australia). If anyone had good info on the reasons behind the IBJJF's change, please share here.I was interviewed for an Australian national current affairs program on road rage, after involvement in an incident, in which my martial arts and jiu jitsu training played a significant part in avoiding serious injury.This blog post details how my wife  and I got involved with the program and our somewhat unusual related adventures.

18now,7,4,"I was reading through this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5rs3sb/im_on_lsd_and_i_hate_myself/ 

And I realized that every single reply was relating it back to their own experiences. Most replies didn't have a child so, to them, they were shouting in the dark. About a sensitive topic too, mental health. Well I put my thoughts on the matter into text and send it away to the servers running the internet and realized that the chances of anyone seeing it are slim. Then I realized that most of the people, on some level, must be aware of the empty space between them and the other people on the thread. 

Everyone making segregated posts that get Dinged if you're lucky to be blessed with a reply, the other people below you haven't gotten a Ding, some not even for months. 

The internet is a lonely place. And Reddit doesn't let me not post caps when I type a title. Rude af reddit.

What do you guys do when you're relaxed?Copy and pasted from my notes is a ""stream of consciousness"" that I had to record after a 2.5g shrooms trip reduced me to hiding under my covers. The trip suddenly turned bad and stayed bad after I started to feel very nauseated and made the decision to NOT throw up because I didn't want to wake my brother up..

11:45pm on a Sunday night with Monday being a the last day of spring break. 

""""


The silence defeats me. 


Hot damn that shit sucks^^ 

I have to grow as a person.. Not into something I know I could be.. But simply be better


Also I think I'm having a panic attack

Uhhhhh I have no idea... I thought I was cold but idk Fuk I feel almost unbearably shitty 
I may just need to throw up maybe I'll try it




At this point in my life I should not be doing drugs. I have no clue what is normal and what should happen when I wake up. 

I mean it had to have come to a point where I realized the bathroom was my safe zone when tripping on shrooms to see it but FUCK IM FUCKED UP. 


These feelings of anxiety are so hard to control its insane. I am almost throwing up.. 
And the fact that I can't tell if these are actual feelings or if it's just some mold on the shrooms is fucked. 

Overwhelming are the feelings of anxiety that I almost throw up, or it could be some mold on the shrooms I can't tell!! 

Please someone help me I feel trapped inside my mind
At the whims of an echo chamber being used for a rave.. Seeing the same faces and feeling the repeating feelings. 
The beat 



I feel like I could be pretty poetic if I worked at it. I'm just so tired I've been going to bed at 2-3-4am all spring break and I feel ready to die honestly. 


Shrooms was a mistake this evening 
But I think I'm sobering up
Omar is being ridiculous all the time what the fuckkkk it's so dumb :( I want to leave 

I have to remember to look at the facts when looking at myself/my life.

I am like a 4 year old in that I have no idea how to deal with myself. I have noo coping mechanisms at all. No judgement nothing pops into my mind when I factor ""Me"" into that thought. that's just what it is and I am in it. So I have some growing up to do and it is going to be extremely difficult. I have no idea where to start at all. Hmm 

I don't think Emil wants to always be in a thought loop of his feelings. 
I feel nauseous in my room but as soon as I go into the bathroom and turn on the shower + fan it's as if nothing can touch me and I just feel safe. I have to work on making more spaces safe for me. I cannot be divided on this. We need to all rise together. This is who I am but with work I ca I can feel the nausea come again. 
I'm not sure if it's the shrooms or if I am actually fucking no no I am who I am thinking about this is me and that over there? Is also me. 


The autocorrect fucked up my train of thought and the train crashed in the middle of nowhere. I am very delicate right now I can feel it I think 
I am also fatigued that's why my body wants to throw up. An idea! I am just fatigued and my body is close to fucking passing out. 
My screen keeps changing hues
I think I am peaking and I cannot imagine how I would be feeling without this phone to record my thoughts underneath my covers. 
When I am thinking clearer I can compare this feeling to how I was feeling when I thought Winston was having a bad time. 

I feel like if I let any thoughts echo in my head I will go insane at this point right now at 2:25am on Monday in March in 2016 

My phone is my pacifier. I have become self aware. Tomorrow Emil changes.

This is bizarre I literally cannot handle any additional stimuli. I tried to look around my room but feelings of either nausea or anxiety hit me so hard. I think it's nausea brought on by the shrooms this is not who I am I am sure of it. You know what I think at least part of it is? These shrooms are fucking strong! I can't handle the shrooms hitting me this hard! 


Ok NOW I am peaking, it's just a matter of how long I stay here 👀 phone is at 13% and I feel like I'll need oxygen but I just solved it. 

Holy shit right now my biggest problem is the collection of psychedelic mushrooms I ate about 2 hours ago.

I am having a very hard time not panicking right now. 12% 
I can't even describe the feeling. Just an overwhelming sense of ""I can't be here or I'll throw up... Or something"" when I come up from under the cover

I am fairly certain the small collection of mushrooms I ate is the source of my nausea. I also think the  mushrooms are making me feel... Well pretty much the same way as DPH made me feel in the head. It's just you can't make yourself fall asleep on mushrooms so I feel really unstable. 11% 

I have no idea how to categorize my feelings right now and it's a feeling I do not like. Well SOMETHING is making me feel really quite sick and I'm wondering if it's my body or my body + mushrooms. 

Do I stay up all night? Will I die of sleep deprivation? No no I took naps today I won't die if I wanted to stay up all night but hell no if I'm gonna do that I need to sleep. 

Ok so I closed my eyes and let the hallucinations do whatever they wanted and my goodness I'm actually tripping so sleep is off the table. I need to get off this phone but I'm holding onto like my life depends on it.. My sanity probably does to be honest. 
I couldn't make myself throw up earlier and I think it's because my body is so used to having to compensate for Emil laying down; stomach has to stay rigid to keep Emil from experiencing acid reflux. 
^ this is a key thought and most likely the most severe side effect of constantly laying down, before I knew it was bad but I didn't know why now I know...
Anyway I can't talk about that right now. 



Pause please 


Just hang on 
Body needs to rest brb


I peaked Or something 

I had to have a break and had to let the feelings flow
My mind and body is truly tired and I will be thankful for tomorrow. 

Yep I peaked I turned over in my bed and no over whelming feelings of anything. 
My stomach and my feelings are very closely paired. When I feel something nausea-

Ok the fact that it is cold in my room and 3am definitely has something to do with how I'm feeling
I need to read more I can't type. I think I'm just really really fucking tired and nausea now. Ok I think these battles I know how to fight



Holy shit the mushrooms are still sooo powerful I need water
I just had a frightening hallucination and it set me back to a point where I'm having a hard time looking at my phone. Hurry up and digest the shit you shit that made me think I am still coming up

UGH I JUST DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING AND I NEED TO LEARN TO BE OKAY WITH THAT. 

The water!! I can feel the shrooms more because the water left my stomach allowing it to start digesting again. Okokokokokokokpk I can only move one thumb nothing else

 Too tired, keeping eyes open is a struggle but I hear soundswhen I close them; metal on metal, cracking wood other stuff

I think I can take visual memory and extract feeling from it buuut in a very unique way. Okok listen right now I have no nice thoughts every time my mind sets on a thought it gets contaminated somehow. Everything is scary and it's hard to move / know what to do next I CANNOT sleep like this I have to ride it out but I feel like my body would have trouble coping if I try to stay up/move 
I'm breathing heavy now I think I need to drink some water. I want to see what water does to the feelings in my stomach but I can't move for fear of my mind being overwhelmed.

Ego death eh? I remember I am Emil but I feel uncomfortable no matter what I dooooooooo

I feel like I'm trapped and can't move until either my body or mind feels better. 
4% 

I feel mentally stronger than I was half an hour ago so I will try and get some water.. My body is telling me I need to pee but 

Maybe thought loops are feel loops. Your brain tells your body what to do/ what to release, some people think that hallucinogenic drugs allow you to see your brain organize it's self so maybe thought loops are you being aware of your brain trying to blugh I have no idea. 

Veeery fucking confusing to be in my mind actually!

But before that I need to make my body as healthy as possible before I try and deal with who my brain is! 

My mouth is a bottleneck 
Draw some shit like that man 


haha I forgot that I also have ¼ of a 3mg melatonin pill in my system
Holy shit I mean holy shit the events of tonight were avoidable to say the least


Holy shit it's cold everywhere!! 


I am getting many brain zaps and I scared to let them happen fully. I can stop them by changing my line of thought,,, right now by waking myself up. These things make sleep impossible but I'm tired now I don't care about typing this correctly fuck it I gotta put down the phone Fuk it's so ducking big man 



Idea of tonight put into scene of two pillars with a thing in the middle, it's called something... It's a piece of furniture... Hmm. 
Well anyway that transforms itself into the laces of a young boy, being tied or otherwise already tied. And the boy is happy going off to play or otherwise similarly joyous. 

More like me confronting myself about my thoughts are on tonight, leaning against this piece of cabinetry and then letting go and saying ok and departing the scene... And then the scene morphs into the laces of a young boy



I am very heavily mentally addicted to my phone for bedtime. 


My body is a body not a machine


Subtleties in emotions are important

Brain zAps fuck. I tried staying in the ""11"" zone and after 1 second my eye started to twitch... 5:18am don't forget that there is a person writing this with feelings attached to the words.

These brain zaps feel like my dreams somewhat. Although maybe not because right now I cannot let my brain slip into sleep mode because that would mean brain zap territory. This is something I will have to recover from I think. Days, weeks...? Maybe? Is it that bad? I have no idea what the future holds. 

   But knowing that I will be holding your hand in mine makes it easier to think about. Although I can't sleep, in the moment without the brain zaps/forced resets I feel at peace... and that's good.

I feel like more of a package to her than I thought she would be to me. 

 
""""
Fin

The brain zaps didn't last into the next day at all. They were very scary for me. They felt like my OTHER bad shrooms trip were I think I let that feeling take over BuT I think that's a post for another day.. 

I just wanted to let somebody know this happened. I'm not gonna go into detail but my whole life I've been depressed and lost. I woke up and over the this week I have felt more mentally free I have ever felt! Spring time plays a part in sure. I'm just reasearching the esports scene with interest and I'd love an updated list. A recommendation on where else I can find this info is appciated as well. I'm getting more and more into looking at SoundCloud as a way to listen to actual people producing their own shit and putting it up. I love how raw the artist / listener exprience is and I'm wondering what part of the internet do all you cool people browse? Age 8 I discovered sex flash games and I started climaxing 1-2 times a day for the next 10 years, through puberty don't forget. 
I'm on day 5(I guess it's been 6?!) and already I've noticed my morning wood is thicker, more sensitive, and goes away easier. 

Just wanted to make a post. I'm shooting (heh) for 120 days to reboot, as I feel like I've never been ""booted"" in the first place so to speak.

smacksaw,8,8,"This is so simple. In fact, I won't be surprised if someone puts a link in the comments showing that it's been covered.

Hulk wants friendship. 

It's that easy.

Watch Ragnarok. All they talk about is ""Thor not Hulk friend"".

Waititi makes is perfectly clear: Valkyrie comes. They are friends. It's obvious. He helps her.

He clears the air with Thor. They establish a friendship between Thor and **Hulk**, not just *Thor and Banner*. 

Hulk runs after Thor. ""Friend!"" he exclaims.

Because he's lonely. Because no one likes or respects him for who he is.

Banner treats him like a trained animal.

Hulk liked being a gladiator. He got recognition for who and what he is. 

Which, at it's core is all anyone wants. 

There's nothing complicated going on. Ragnarok makes it clear over and over again that Hulk's primary motivation is validation from others, most importantly through **friendship**. 

Hulk came out on the Bifrost because Hulk's *friends* were in trouble. Not because Banner called him. In fact, Hulk was content to let Banner die. He waited. He didn't do it for Banner. He did it for Valkyrie and Thor. 

This ain't rocket surgery, folks.

Banner will be friends with his inner Hulk."
gurgle528,6,5,"I'm a C# coder. The last few Steam item stealing malware (internal name of SteamStealer) have also been coded in C#, so I happened to already have software on my computer to easily decompile them. Doing so has led me to some interesting information (please note, I am in no way professional so mistakes are possible).

The first one I looked at, the one that said ""dude wtf"" and sent a ""screenshot"", was not obfuscated in any way. I decompiled it easily (using dotPeek, so it was literally 1 click) and found the [Steam profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/traders123123) items were going to. The name ""traders123123"" probably refers to the fact that it had (apparently it no longer has them one its friends list) two private accounts named 123 on its friends list. The general way it worked is the malware would send items to the account (which had to be public, otherwise it couldn't receive trade requests). The account was bot run and would accept the requests and take the items. Every once in a while a (presumably) human operator would comment on the account's profile a link to another profile, and items would be sent to that account [not certain]. If the account was a private account the account would be set to public so items could be sent to it and then it would be set back to private (by a human operator possibly, one of the 123s did occasionally have a human operator that would chat with people). I followed a bunch of the links that were in the profile's comment section and well they lead to more profiles with more links until eventually you reach a dead end. The majority of profiles seemed to be Russian, with the exception of an Albanian and Argentinian and a few others. A few of the Russian profiles linked to the main 123 (the other never seemed to be used) and referred to it as ""vanguard"", which [barring any slang meaning, I don't speak Russian] probably means they use that account as a protective layer for transferring items that weren't obtained legitimately.

The second one was a better attempt in regards to hiding who they are. They used Confuser (considered to be the best free obfuscator) to obfuscate their code, but I just used NoFuser and then decompiled with dotPeek to reveal the same base code as the previous malware with changes for new Steam accounts. Something that didn't change was the strange ""123"" account. This account was different and seemed to be running different bot software (the other 123 would automatically accept friends, this did not. the other public account used for trades also would automatically block people that sent friend requests, this one did not). This attack seems to be a script kiddie's recreation of the previous attack, with numerous holes. The [new profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/gogogogoffffff/games/?tab=recent) that was used does not own any games (the previous owned CS:GO to get CS:GO items), and thus can not trade (you need SteamGuard enabled for 15 days to trade). This should render the malware fairly useless, however he has 313 ""Steam"" items in his account which may be stolen. 

Both attacks used reg.ru to host their sites, so the second attack might be Russian in origin but I'm not certain on that one. 

Both of these attacks are potentially by the same people, at the very least they are by people who probably browse the same websites (maybe a Russian hacking forum?) because the back-end bot software isn't easily available to my knowledge

My question is: is there any way Steam can stop these attacks? They read Steam's memory and take the Steam client's session so maybe they could change the way one of those works?
Or maybe just make it so you can't use one trade token for hundreds of trades?"

How was it?I work for the Sheriffs Office as a detention deputy. After 2 years I moved from nights to days. I’m struggling finding motivation and time to do things I use to like go to the gym or play video games. I’m stuck in a loop of just sleeping and working even on my days off. I normally work 13 hour shifts. Anyone have advice on how to get out of this dayshift rut and get me back to doing things?"
theprofessor24,9,10,"[removed]Hey everyone. I am trying to gather some information and hopefully someone with first hand knowledge can help.

I am looking for the best group breakers / stores not in North America that primarily break / stock hockey product. 

I am looking to compile a list for a hobby forum I frequent and while the shops/breakers in N/A are easy to find, the ones internationally are far harder.

If anyone has any first hand knowledge or experience with a shop or breaker of hockey product in Europe/UK/Australia etc that they would be willing to share I would be really appreciative. Feel free to PM me as well. Thanks!Just thought of this and wanted to see how others felt.

Why not have two WWE superstars sit down on a couch and watch a match they had together. They will obviously commentate and talk about what happened. Im sure they will joke about things in the match and go over spots etc.

I know the idea is very interesting but I guess I would worry that it could get boring. Also, maybe exposing the business too much? 


With the right characters speaking I think it could be pretty entertainingHey everyone. I wasnt sure where to ask this question. If this is the wrong place please direct me to the right one.

Bought this thing at a auction. I looked into it a bit and I believe its a dev kit console.

It has 1 gig of ram 
Power socket matches a HDMI/Jasper set up
It has a side car with 1 port and from the picture it looks green in color. Maybe it's grey though?

Any other information I can give to help identify it?
Anyone have a clue on possible value?

http://tinypic.com/r/290sai8/9Hey Everyone

I am seeking some assistance in finding the proper part for my father. I am looking for a cargo bed divider for a 2019 Laramie Longhorn. It has the factory bed rails in it already. I have been looking extensively online for this but have not been able to locate one with absolute certainty. It's a Christmas gift and I do not want to gift the wrong part.

Any insight is appreciated.

Thanks!Hello! New to Hot Wheels and I have to say they are actually quite fascinating. Long story short my cousin gifted me hundreds of new cars and I have been going through them. I noticed that I have a 10 Shelby GT500 that is missing the cobra decal on the side of the car. I am pretty sure this is a decal error but I just wanted some confirmation if possible. I am not new to collectibles so I understand that something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. However, how sought after do you think this error (If it is one) could be?

Thanks!

I know its a theory but writing letters is something this Wayne Edwards did. The person who originated this theory mentioned that he was scouring the case looking for Edwards to make contact. A letter, a news paper add. Anything. 

It's probably absolutely nothing but considering this cluster fuck of a case I think everything needs to be looked at.Friends and I are trying to find this song which was VERY popular when it came out. Was always on the radio. 

The biggest clue I have is what everyone knows the song for. Its something like Mally/Bally/Tally. The main part of the song goes something like """" Bally (followed by latin hip hop beat) random words ""bally"" then the song goes into Spanish rap with a bit of English mixed in. This Bally......Bally will occur a few times in the song.

Thanks for the help!"

Ghostspider1989,6,6,"I remember a new game on PC would be about $40-$50 while that same game on console would be $60.

Then modern warfare 2 came out and was $60 for the PC version. Ever since then every PC game was $60.

I miss those days....

Edit:

I'm seeing a lot of confusion here. Idk why I have to explain this but I'm talking about the price of games upon release.

Of course a game is going to be cheaper some time after release when it's on sale. With that argument, one could say no video game is $60.

Edit 2:

Omg some of you people are fucking insane. Some of you are sending me messages and taking some serious offense to what I said, as if there was something to be offended by.

Conversations should generate light not heat.

Edit 3:

ITT people who didn't read wtf I wrote here.I saw some pictures of the cover of a she hulk comic and she just looks like a female body builder. Also the expression she was making suggested she was conscious of things around her as opposed to the hulk which always looks like he has a loose grasp on reality.

So how come the hulk becomes a massive giant while she-hulk just looks like a regular girl that happens to be green?I'm in AIT and it's just been a clusterfuck. Either everything is last minute or nobody tells me shit.

Heard a knock on my door, standing there is my battle buddy in full battle rattle and fully stuffed ruck sack. I'm standing there in PTs. He goes:

""....did anyone tell you you're supposed to be downstairs??""

Of course not. I was so pissed i took my time getting my shit together.

Another time i get a text from my fellow battle.

""Final formation is at 1600 today""

It was 1545. Literally everyday for the past 15 weeks it's been at 1700. Thank goodness i was fucking dressed. Had i been showering or napping or something i would have been screwed.

Hey, tell me when to be there and I'll be there. I've never been late once at basic or AIT but this lack of communication just pisses me the fuck off to no end.

Edit:

Some people have been asking so ill explain here. I just finished all my classes and graduated but I'm still here so I'm a hold over. In other words, all i do is PT in the morning and final formation at night.

That's why I have time to shower and nap.....along with our canteens and whatever else we didn't have to turn back in.

By the end of the day the trash can was full of sleeping mats and canteens.

I get to my first duty station and according to CIF i was supposed to hold onto that stuff. Now I'm gonna owe them for that apparently.

I'll take a order of nuggets with extra 'fuck you' sauce."

jimintoronto,9,1,"I know that this forum is usually people asking "" how do I learn about "" a subject, but I thought a bit about how to keep you car running properly might be of interest.

First, these points will be general stuff. I am not going to try to diagnose that funny noise in your car. I will cover the subject of "" noises and rattles "".

All automobiles have common things. Engine, transmission drive train, brakes steering and electrical systems and FLUIDS.

Lets talk about fluids. All of the fluids in a car have different colours and in some cases a different texture to the touch.

Motor oil, When new a honey gold, when used a dark brown or black. Brake fluid, light gold colour when new. Radiator coolant, light green or yellow when new. Power steering fluid reddish pink. Transmission fluid, darker red. Windscreen cleaner for summer use, greenish or pink, it has about 5 percent detergent in it to help clean off bug splatter. Winter windscreen washer fluid is a de icer that won't freeze until it gets down to the temperature rated on the label on the jug. If you live in a place where the temps get to below freezing ( minus 10 C or below 30 F ) do not leave summer fluid or worse yet, plain water in your washer tank. It will freeze and crack the plastic tank.

So now we know about the different colours of fluids. You car is leaking. The colour should help to identify the ""what is it "" now to locate it. Rad is at the front of the engine, tranny is connected TO the engine, and the power steering is powered by a engine belt on the top side of the engine. Put a flattened cardboard box under the engine/tranny area, leave it on the ground after driving the car. Look at it the next day. Don't move it yet. Look at the fluid colour, and where it is dripping from. Start car, wait a few minutes for everything to heat up... look again. If you are going to take it to a repair garage, wipe some of the fluid up with a clean paper towel . The technician can sniff it and usually identify it by the smell and colour.

Records. All car makers provide a owner's manual with new cars. But over the years they get lost. BUY a owner's manual from the dealership OR download the EXACT manual for your car. Remember this mind helper. YMMET. It means Year Make Model Engine size and type of transmission. 

YMMETY is the very first thing that a service writer at the dealership will ask you for. The second information required is the VIN is the  Vehicle Identification Number, It is YOUR car's unique identifier code,. The VIN is found on the left side of the dashboard under the edge of the windscreen., There is also a information plate on the door post next to the side of the driver's seat. It has a lot of info, including the proper air inflation number for your tires and their size. Tires also have their size... year of manufacture and  what weather condition they are rated for. ALL SEASON tires are NOT winter tires. If you live in a snow area  buy winter tires.. Would you wear summer sandals in a foot of snow   ? Of course not.

Having the makers information book solves many of your ""what is that  thing "" questions. It also sets out exactly what the service schedule is. The service calendar starts when the car is brand new, and goes to at least the 200,000 mile mark. It based on miles driven not months on the calendar.  

Makers recommended service mileage points. IF you follow the book you will extend the lifespan, reliability and resale value of ANY car. Being able to show a perspective buyer the actual repair and service receipts will go a long way towards them wanting to buy it. 

Even if your car is 20 year old civic, you still want it to start, drive and STOP with out problems right ? Maintaining a car requires spending money BEFORE it dies 150 miles from home. BUY a AAA membership. ONE tow call ( a hundred miles from home ) will definitely cost more than even the luxury AAA membership does. They also do flat tire changes ( you DO have a spare tire right  ? ) and boost batteries, and bring you enough gas to get to the nearest service station. Its a must, even if your car is all most new.

Gas stations. Quite a few cars and light duty trucks use diesel fuel now. Before you start pumping LOOK at the handle of the fuel pump. What colour is it ? YELLOW means diesel fuel. You do not  want to put ANY amount of diesel   in your gasoline powered car. THAT is a huge cost to repair it, and in the case of a older car, its now scrap metal. LOOK before you pump.

Gasoline is highly explosive. Its what movie stunt directors use to create those huge fire balls . Gasoline is also very sensitive to static electrical charge. If you are going to fill a portable gas can at the station PUT IT ON THE GROUND. That creates a ground, so the static electrical charge created when the gas flows through the fuel hose to the portable gas can....It will be harmlessly directed into the ground, If you keep the gas can in or on the vehicle ( think back of a pick up truck ) you CAN end up on fire, along with everybody else at the station . 

General tools and stuff to keep in your car.

A set of cheap sockets and a ratchet driver, A multi bit screw driver, a pair of vice grips, a small wire cutter, a box cutter, some duct tape and some zip ties in a number of sizes. Hand cleaner, paper towels and a old bath towel to lie on if you need to get on the ground to see something. A big LED flashlight ( at least 12 or more individual bulbs ) with spare batteries for it. OH and a package of fuses. Find out where YOUR cars fuse panel is. 

NEVER go under a car that is only supported by a jack. TWO axle stands at minimum. Block opposite end  wheel, to prevent rolling forward or backward. 

Tires. Buy the BEST that you can get. Tires are NOT the place to try to save money. Try this, Get a piece of chalk, draw a circle around the part of your tire that touches the ground. Now move the car and LOOK at that little chalk circle... that is the only contact point ( times 4 tires ) that you have with the road. If you tires are under inflated you will have poor directional control, even worse in rain or snow. The minimum tread depth that you should  drive on is three thirty seconds of an inch. Minimum. In many jurisdictions 3/32 is illegal and will get your car taken off the road, plus a fine.

Daily walk around. Before you start the engine, check oil and rad coolant. Its a lot easier if things are cool. Drips ? Tires ? 

OK get in check mirrors for adjustment. Start and WAIT at least 30 to 60 seconds, for the oil pump to get the cold oil from the bottom of the engine  to the top where the camshaft, crankshaft, valve train, pistons and rods are sitting with only a very thin coating of oil left over from the last time the engine was running The first 5 minutes of each start up of a cold engine, produces about 60 percent of the wear on the engine over it's life span.

OK lost of stuff to absorb , right ?

So how do I know all this stuff. 50 years of driving, commercial trucks, race cars, Ambulances , limos and a lot of clunkers.

Jim B. This a original WW2 British  Army training booklet about physical combat strategy and how to kill the other guy.

I found it in a military museum collection, along with over 30 other training booklets. from both WW 1 and WW2. 

http://wartimecanada.ca/sites/default/files/documents/Attack%20and%20Defence%201942.pdf

Reading it is an eye opening example of the tactics and mind set of the time period. 

Your comments  are welcome.

If you are interested, I can put up more of the collection of training manuals , that deal with specific subjects like trench warfare, the use of gas and the use of  machine guns and grenades by front line troops .

Jim B. 

 Not all the men who served in the US military in WW2 were heroes.  Some of them were  hardened criminals who were convicted in a court, and the judge  gave them the choice "" Join the army or go to jail "". Others were drunks or those who wanted to get away from a messy marriage or debts.

During the course of the war, the US military executed 161 men, mostly for rape, and or murder. Some took place in the US, some in Britain and in the case that I am about to outline, in Europe, after the D Day landings. 


Each case was investigated, a courts marshal trial was conducted and a verdict of guilty was returned. The order of execution was approved  by  either General Eisenhower or in some cases by the Commanding General of that theatre of the war.

Now to the hidden part. All of the 96 men were buried at the same place, a French civilian graveyard. All of the graves have only a number, from 1 to 96 on the headstones. No names, no unit, no serial number. Each of them had been hung, by a US army executioner, ( who lied to get the job by saying that he had been the State executioner in Georgia ) who botched quite  a few of the hangings because he was drunk. 

No body else wanted the job so he stayed in the job until the end of the war.

These men were hidden by the US military.

The reason ? Their victims were civilians, and that was hushed up.

The location was known as Field E.

Canada has a few DOZEN specially designed water bombers. They are the only aircraft in the world that were designed for that work.

They are sitting idle, as this is our winter season. In Canada our fire season doesn't start for at least 5 months from now. These aircraft are capable of flying ( with a few refueling stops along the way ) to Australia. 

I would hate to think that these valuable fire fighting aircraft are sitting up here, because NO BODY thought to ASK us for help ? 

Here is a video of a Canadair 315 doing low level water bombing of about 12,000 gallons of water onto a forest fire in western Canada. The aircraft reloads the water tanks while running across the water at 70 mph. It takes about one minute to refill the tanks, then its off again. Thats a hell of a lot faster than a plane that needs to land on a runway, and reload from a truck.

JimB.This sub is eye opening to me. The large number of young people who apparently don't know even the most basic things about how to live on their own. 

Some of the things I would include in the ""how to do adult things "" course would be.....Personal cleanliness. Cleaning your living space. Washing your own clothes, and your dishes. How to study. How to concentrate. Ignoring your phone. Sleeping on a regular schedule. 

Taxes ( the basic concept ) banking, loans and credit cards. Car ownership, and getting a driver's licence. Car insurance ( every 16 year old wants a car), right ? 

2 hours a week, starting in the 7th grade. That gives them  six years to cover the subject fully. Practical teaching, like  here is the washing machine, now pay attention. Personal grooming. 

Remember that these young people ( in a couple of years ) will be your new employees , or the people living next door to your apartment suite.

Jim B. In a two year period this Ontario Provincial Police constable made over 3500 traffic stops. His patrol area covers a rural county, plus the busiest 400 series highway in the Province, the 401. He recently received a Commissioner's commendation for his outstanding efforts. 
https://globalnews.ca/news/8348022/prince-edward-county-opp-traffic-safety-award/?fbclid=IwAR1dck0OJ2JNKPPOYTeN7MA40DuwtRpzbU-E-ztgPJgNgR0-L6v99SJ7ap0I have about 40 years of automotive service and repair experience behind me. I'm now retired, but still active. It seems to me that quite a few adults ( both male and female ) don't have much understanding of how a car works, or how it needs to be maintained.

My question. Do you think that there would be a market for a short course on basic car systems, how they work, and how to talk to the mechanic who services your car ? I'm not talking about  intensive training, rather a 4 week program, 3 hours on a saturday, times 4 weeks, for a total of 12 hours. The course would be ""hands on "" with real cars, and real physical parts, like brakes, steering and   how an engine functions.

What do you think ?I an 72, and this recently hit me. Of course I never expected to live this long, given all of the times in the past  when I could  have easily been killed. 

Jim B. Just announced on US networks. 

Your reaction  ?A 56 year old woman from Florida was arrested at the Sarnia Ontario port of entry on November the first, 2021, by Canadian Border Services Agency officers. The woman's car was found to contain 56 semi automatic hand guns, plus a number of illegal magazines, plus a few hundred rounds of loose ammunition. Some of the had guns had altered serial numbers. The woman was arrested and charged with 15 criminal code offences. She is now being held in jail with no bail. She faces up to 15 years in prison, if convicted . This case highlights the problem of illegal guns coming into Canada from the USA. For every seizure made at the border, there are likely  10  others that are not detected.  In my opinion, she is a mule, being paid to drive to Canada, by a US criminal group. She didn't think this up on her own.

Jug-Seb,3,7,"A lot of people think the latest DLC is... less than optimal to say the least. Taking *more* time to create larger DLCs would be a step in the right direction due to a larger area of fixes and wants being satisfied at the same time, thus more of the DLC would be bought.

As in the title, a dynamic weather DLC would include the weather Snowfall has delivered but also rain issues like flooding (not due to rising water levels), heat issues like heat waves (in which water fountains could aid?), water restrictions if there isn't enough water, and the dreamed of **destruction**. Hurricanes, tsunamis, and other dangers could also be incorporated into a DLC.

It would give more depth to some existing amenities as well as create new challenges other than just a heating system. A wider range equals a broader audience, and more happy Cims (or possibly dead ones)!"

spidermonkeyjoe,4,10,"\*\*Price Range\*\*: Under a $100

\*\*Purpose\*\*:  Lantern like use to light a small room with handheld outdoor use as a secondary

&#x200B;

\*\*Battery Type & Quantity\*\*:  I would prefer something that I don't have to remove the battery to charge and would be chargeable via USB. Doesn't need a large battery capacity.

&#x200B;

\*\*Size\*\*: smaller is better, I don't need a long battery life or really bright but I am flexible

&#x200B;

\*\*Type\*\*:  Handheld (maybe with like a diffuser for lantern use?

&#x200B;

\*\*Main Use\*\*:  It will be recharged from a solar panel (USB ports), spend most of it's life on a desk or shelf to be used to light the room for an hour or two each night and light my way to the outhouse. Will also be thrown in a bag and carried around for general use.

&#x200B;

\*\*Switch Type\*\*: I don't have a preference for switch type

&#x200B;

\*\*Anything Else?\*\*: I don't want to deal with a lot of external stuff for the light. I only get to pack a couple bags for two years and I will be living in a small space so simple (not necessarily small) is desired.

I am provided with a lamp by the peace corps but it kinda sucks and I am bringing my own headlamp but it also kinda sucks. So this is hopefully just a quality of life improvement over the mediocre stuff I have already.

I tried doing my own research but was intimidated by the standard recommendations from this sub. You guys seem obsessed with light quality and don't seem to car much about the charging practicalities.

&#x200B;

Edit: I ended up getting a Sofirn sp36 2700k with a diffuser. I think it is way more flashlight then I need (heavily considered Sofirn's sc21 or IF25) but decided I like the idea of having the option for more light and if I don't use the higher brightness settings the larger battery capacity will be nice. 

&#x200B;

Thank you to everyone that commented and helped me choose. I was truly lost in the woods before I posted. I am not actually a backpacker but I still go to this community often for camping gear because I like the ultralight mentality when looking for gear. I am primarily a motorcycle camper (check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/Lucas.Burson/) if you want to see what I mean).


**What I want in a tent** I am looking for a two person tent (to throw all my gear in when it gets wet), that has a single wall design (less setup time than my current tent's rain fly setup), a vestibule (cook on from in my tent in rainy weather), a very compact stored size and hopefully durable enough material to last me a long while. Oddly enough, the one thing I don't really care about in a tent is weight! kinda against this sub's primary ideology but I hope that's not an issue. 


**Tent's I am looking at**

-*Lunar Duo*: Offers all the features I want at a great price but I don't ride a motorcycle with trekking poles so I would need to accommodate that somehow. 

-*Sierra Designs Clip Flashlight 2*: I like the pole structure, doorway and price point but it has a separate rain fly.

-*3F UL Gear lancer 2 person*: extremely appealing price but separate rain fly and again with the trekking poles. 


Thank you so much for reading this far, I would appreciate any advice you have to share and can hopefully answer any questions you may have about me, my trips or my gear needs. I am in the Process of attaching an 08 GSXR front end onto my 69 CL350.  I thought I was home free until I was putting the Brake calipers onto the forks and they hit the spokes. 

This is happening because I used a custom Hub from [Cognito Moto](http://cognitomoto.com/products/gsx-r-hub-bolt-on-conversion-laced-wheel-1) and Laced it using Buchanan spokes to my original 19"" rim which changed the angle of the spokes causing interference with the stock GSXR calipers.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/YrcQL) are a few Photos of the bike and the front wheel to give you an idea what I'm talking about. The caliper would only need to be an inch or so thinner to work so I was thinking I might be able to grab a caliper from another motorcycle but I don't know where to start looking. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  
So a few months ago I crashed my Honda Cl 350 and bent up a few things pretty badly. When I got around to replacing the bars and a few other of the obviously broken things and got back on the road I noticed a pretty serious front end wobble at about 55mph. 
I took it into a mechanic and like I feared the forks and lower triple were bent. I was told by the mechanic I need to replace the bent parts and he advised me I need to be careful to get forks that will fit (spacing between the forks and steering stem diameter and length).
Problem is I can't find a good resource for finding the diameter and width of my current steering stem. Can I trust my own measurements of such things? Or if anyone could supply a good online resource for looking these things up it would be great.
The bike is a 1969 Cl 350 K1 Scrambler. If anyone can offer any advice on the issue it would be much appreciated. Sorry for the length of text and if anyone has any questions regarding the bike or the repair please feel free to ask.I have a quick question about which PCM would be appropriate for which battery cell configuration. Right now I am looking at using [this PCM](http://www.batteryspace.com/Protection-Circuit-Module-PCM-with-Equilibrium-Function.aspx) with eight 18650 battery cells with two battery cells placed in parallel in between each set of solder points on the PCM. Is this safe? I realize I will lose individual battery cell monitoring by placing them together on the board but I haven't found any boards specifically labeled for eight cells with 4 in series and two in parallel, and the amperage rating on the board exceeds what I would expect if I were to use one battery cell in between each set of solder points.

Thanks for reading, if you have any general advice for homebuilding battery packs that aren't related directly to the question please feel free to share. I am mostly operating on a few different tutorials I found online and my previous experience with electronics for this so any informed advice will be greatly appreciated.tldr; I like [this](http://imgur.com/a/W24Ia) shirt but am unsure what to wear it with or on what occasion to wear it to. 

My father got [this](http://imgur.com/a/W24Ia) shirt for my brother who wears patterns that are more of this nature. My father purchased it in Jamaica so the sizing was a bit unusual so he got a XXXL because the sizing runs much smaller there. It fit very loose on my brother and he is picky so I took it.

The shirt was too big for me in every dimension as well so I ran it through a hot wash shrinking it a little but it was still too large. I ended up taking in the sides with darts so the waist is almost perfect. However, the shoulders and sleeves are maybe a half inch to long and the neck is also a little too big. The shirt isn't the perfect fit but it is close enough for my low budget standards and it has amazingly soft fabric so I want to make it work. 

Beyond the pattern the collar itself is very long and spreads rather enthusiastically making me feel like one of the [guys from dazed and confused](http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/screencrush.com/files/2013/09/dazed.jpg). I know it is not that extreme but that is what is going through my head. 

Finally to the question part, how should I wear this shirt? What pants, shoes and belt would be a good pairing? Is this a shirt I wear to parties or can I make it work for an everyday? I have a light pair of jeans that I tried it with and I really didn't like how it went with those. My brother suggested a pair of chinos which may work but still leave open the rest of the wardrobe.

MITstudent,4,2,"When the Pixel 3XL first came out, there was a promotion for $799 Fi credit with purchase of 2 phones and activating a new account.

My family hasn't upgraded phones for over 3 years, cuz the phones all got really expensive lately.

With the $799 credit, I thought this would be a really nice gift for my parents, I felt pretty justified.  But I knew the phones wouldn't arrive right away, so I went on chat with Fi Support and made sure I'd still get the promotion, even if the phones arrived past the promotion date.  Yes, they said, the promotion will be honored.  So I muster up the courage and order two Pixel 3XLs.  My palms got super sweaty in the process.

I order a black one for my dad and a white one for my mom.  The black one pretty much arrives right away, but I don't need to activate it until I go visit my parents for Thanksgiving.  The white one takes weeks and the delivery date keeps shifting.  Then, 4 weeks later, I get a text message from Chase saying there's a fraud alert.  I check and it's Google charging me for the white phone as they ship it out.  I immediately tell Chase it's authorized, but the transaction's already been rejected.  I go on Fi to re-charge for the order, but there's no option.  Chat support is not available. I need to have it for Thanksgiving when I see them.  So, I just go ahead and re-order the phone. 

I contact Fi Support later when chat comes back online.  Fi Support says I don't qualify for the promotion.  I feel the sky crumbling.  This doesn't make sense.  Ok, what are my options then?  Well, it's been more than 15 days since I got the black phone, so I can't even return it.  I submitted a support ticket to please, please take a closer look at this incident with a kind heart.

I was flat out rejected.

This is a lot of money to me, and I'm not a big user of social media, so I can't even tweet this out or post it on fb to get attention.  Not sure how many people will actually see this post, but I just needed to tell someone and get it off my chest....  thanks for reading

**UPDATE**:  Thanks u/satoshicoinftw, for telling me about Reddit Request!  u/dmziggy has responded to my submission and has escalated the issue.  I'll keep everyone posted on what happens!  Thanks everyone for the support!  Shoutouts to u/ht3k u/RigatoniMontana u/KDLGates u/GameShowKid for your ideas!

**UPDATE 2**:  u/dmziggy has escalated the issue to the highest team possible, but they came back with ""You did not activate a new account, so the disqualification stands""  I'm not sure why they would lie about this.  I will see if I can take this to small claims court."
i_cast_kittehs,7,6,"As far as I understand it, the w&t is made by and kept on the timelord's person, in general. 

A w&t contains secrets, confessions and dying wishes, directed to people coming after the owner has passed. So why was the doctor's confession dial this torturing, secret extracting maze?

Was it meant for someone else? Meaning, if the doctor dies and someone else opened the dial they'd be trapped there, so as not to find the doctor's secrets? Or was it *a* confession dial (not his own), doubling as a closed energy system, torturing hyper facility?

Hi all,

Got a coat button that needs sewing. Does anyone one where I can get a needle and some thread?Hello all.

My brother, 19, had his second epileptic attack the day before yesterday. The first one was about two months prior. After both the attacks he was rushed to the ER and after the latest, the doctor started him on Trileptal (Carbamazepine), which I understand is quite common. 

I was wondering if you could give me some info about the daily life with the condition and what his immediate family can do to help and mitigate the dangers surrounding it. 

My brother is studying to become an architect in a different city than where we live, but after the first attack my father has been staying with him (we are not in the USA btw, so no dorms and such - just a rented appartment). Do you thing that it's a good idea for a young student, first time away from home, to be living with a parent again, even for safety reasons?

What are some good advice I can give him, coming from your experience, to keep himself safe from harm during an episode? For example, padding certain furniture? ~~Taking baths~~ Showering sitting down? Stuff like that. 

Also, how is it best for me to approach the subject? Both with regards to this thread, and in general in, you know, any future interactions. What are some things which can be incensitive and I don't realize now? Personally, I find it fascinating and can openly talk about it with him, but I find all things brain fascinating. 

Finally, as far as I understand, Trileptal's side effects include difficulty in memorize and concentration. Both those things can be quite detrimental to his studies, so any advice there? Obviously he has to take the medicine for some time first to see what happens, but any upfront input would be gratly appreciated.

He does not know about this post, I just want some information going into this. I will let him know about the subreddit though.

Πού πρέπει να πάω για να ξεκινήσω τη διαδικασία που θα καταλήξει σε απαλλαγή? Στο φρουραρχείο στην Κατεχάκη στη Αθήνα και μετα στο 401 κάποια μέρα πριν τις 12/3 Ή κάπου στο στρατόπεδο στον Έβρο?

ΕυχαριστωΚαλησπερα

Ολοκληρωνω την πρακτικη μου τον Αυγουστο, και σκοπευω να φυγω στο εξωτερικο αμεσως μετα για μεταπτυχιακο.

Ο εργοδοτης της πρακτικης θελει να συνεχισω να κανω καποια πραγματα στο εργο που δουλευω αυτο τον καιρο οσο ειμαι στο εξωτερικο για σπουδες, και γι αυτη την εργασια εχει προτεινει να με πληρωσει με ""συμβαση αναθεσης εργου"" (τιτλο κτησης). Το εργο ειναι στον τομεα αναπτυξης λογισμικου.

Στο συμβολαιο της σμβασης γινεται αναφορα για το φορο 20% και χαρτοσημο 3.6% τα οποια ειναι σχετικα με τον τιτλο κτησης, αλλα πουθενα δεν λεει κατι σχετικο με ασφαλιστικες εισφορες.

Οποτε αν ξερει καποιος:

1. Ποιες ειναι οι υποχρεωσεις του εργοδοτη και οι δικες μου ως προς τις ασφαλιστικες εισφορες? Πρεπει να πληρωθουν και αν ναι, απο ποιον?
2. Τι ποσοστο τις αμοιβης ειναι οι ασφαλιστικες εισφορες?
3. Το εισοδημα μου απο αυτη τη συμβαση με ποιον τροπο εμφανιζεται στην φορολογικη δηλωση? Hej!

I've been in Stockholm for 3 months now, studying, and I won't make it through the winter without a gym! I have a (probably a bit obnoxious) list of things I'd like for in a gym.

I'm looking for one with a good variety of free weights, pretty heavy (>100kg on the main lifts), no need for classes or personal trainers, with a student price, and preferably as little commitment as possible. Some free space for sprints, heavy walks etc would be amazing! I'm staying around the Bergshamra, but anything closer to the center will do too.

Anybody know if the 24/7 fitness in Bergshamra or the F&S at Danderyd are good choices?

-susan-,7,8,"I'm 36 and have struggled with acne since I was young.  I have tried every treatment, cleanser, etc etc etc etc, none of them fixed it.  About a month ago, I bought apple cider vinegar (acv from hereon in) to use with that aztec clay mask, and somehow in my googling I came across something that said acv was a good acne treatment because it restores your skin's ph balance.

I had nothing to lose, so I made some acv toner (1 part acv, 2 parts water, in a spray bottle) and started using it every single time I washed my face.  I spray it all over my face once I've dried it, and then do my moisturizers/serums/etc overtop.

I used to get about 2-3 cystic breakouts a week.  I've been using acv for a month now and since I started using it, I had one breakout, and I can barely even call it that, because when I saw it starting to form, I applied more acv to that spot in addition to my regular routine.  Instead of becoming a red, cystic disaster, it disappeared instead of forming.  My breakouts would usually take 1-2 weeks to come to a head and then finally heal.  This breakout basically started and disappeared completely in the span of two days, with none of the lingering hyper-pigmentation I used to get.  It has literally been a miracle cure for me.

If you're struggling with acne, please give acv a shot.  It is so inexpensive and it literally changed my skin completely.  I don't think what brand you use matters (I use Bragg), but it DOES have to have ""the mother"" in it (it will say on the bottle if it does).  I hope it can help some other people like it did for me.  "

Vahallen,9,1,"Hi there, mediocre fighting game player here

I felt like making a thread talking about my experience with fighting game ""dissonance"", what I mean by this is the difference between someone used to fighting games and beginners

Most players learning for the first time have to go trough the struggle and once they overcome it they can actually play the game

The thing is that after you get used to fighting games you kinda forget how you struggled with what now you see as the most basic shit ever and it's not really about elitism but rather how much stuff there is and how big is the window for improvement

Anyone can see the difference between a newbie and mediocre-good player when they challenge each other, what I wanna bring up is regarding what the newbie see as difficult as he learns the game compared to how the more experienced players sees the game and I recently re-experinced it thanks to a friend who asked me for help

It was kind of a cold shower:

A friend wanted to learn DragonballFighterZ and asked for my help and I gladly accepted

I tried to explain him how to block, how to counter some things and some other basic stuff like how to deal with some common ""tactics"", fundamentally I tried to teach him basic neutral and he wasn't that good at it, still I expected it, nothing strange there, it takes time to get used to that sort of stuff, you need actual practice aka play real matches

Then I tried to teach him how to combo....OH BOY, the cold shower

When you realize they struggle with square, square, down triangle, triangle (there is a whole argument to be made about fighting game lingo too, if I actually use fighting game terms with newbies they would think I'm having a stroke)

....and then it hits you, the realization that what some people might struggle with, what they themselves might have struggled with too at the beginning, is not even tought about among the requirements to be good at a fighting game after you get ""good"" at them

It's like someone joining the formula1 and not knowing how to drive

Everyone had to learn even what is the most basic shit at some point but then they went so deep in the rabbit hole that they even forgot you actually need to learn that, it becomes a given, hell much more complex stuff becomes a given

 - Much more complex combos

 - Pressure and Mix-ups

 - Frame data

 - Wake up pressure

 - Spacing

 - Zoning

 - Mindgames

 - Reads

 - Match-up knowledge

 - Set-ups

 - Resource management

 - Game specific mechanics

AND THEN, plauer skill comes in to play, reaction times, execution, planning ahead & the like

tl;dr As you get good at fighting games you forget that struggling with the most basic shit is actually normal for a lot of people

P.S.= This post is a bit of a mess, just passing time as I wait MK11 to drop in which I will try to coach another friend of mineYou get more follow up based on how many characters of your team are still alive, less characters alive = more followups

Kaiohken moves:

 - H = Goku does a small delay and then travels fast on ground, if he comes in contact with an enemy he will grab them

 - L = normal rush punch, can be blocked medium, next L is an high attack

 - 2L = rolling attack, hits high

 - M = cross up knee hit, next M is a low

 - 2M = Sliding kick, hits low

 - S = projectile (Having problems landing kaioken after a knockdown? Try starting your kaioken with this), can also be used upwards if you do 2S

 - R1 = teleport kick, let's you hit opponents too away from the ground, can be used for making your kaioken combos do more damage

 - R2 kaiohken x3 = upwards kamehameha

  - R2 kaiohken x20 = teleport hard knockdon kamehameha

 - Kaiohken ender = after a successfull teleport kick press L for a dive (if dive kills you get a zoom-in and an unique animation) and R2 for a Kamehameha (can only be done with Kaioken x3 or x20, the Kamehameha consumes one extra bar, you get an hard knockdown off of it if you're in kaioken x20...sadly it's kinda useless because of distance and self stun/recovery frames, best way to use it is probably doing a quick 214S)

Welcome to the first rekka mix-up super of DBFZ

Here some optimal kaioken x20 routes (2 character dead)

 - L > M > M > M > M > M > S >R1 > L (1 bar, 2970 damage)

 - R1 > R1 (2 bar, damage 4250)



Update regarding defensive option for the opponent:

 - Can reflect followup hits

 - Kaiohken grab cam be countered by pretty much anything

 - If opponent uses vanish after your first hit you will get hit...unless you go for an M followup styling on them ( you will dodge the vanidh and hit them)

 - After blocking a Kaiohken attack it looks like the opponent might be able to trade hits or straight beat you depending on which attack they use (character depandant I guess)

  - Because of gaps it's vulverable to reversals and when the super is over there is quite some recovery so it can be risky

 - Kaiohken S follow up pushes away the opponent so it's your best option for finishing Kaiohken failed mix ups but you're still punishable ( you can also try to bait them by pushing them away making them think you are don and then following up with a 2M Kaiohken from far away)

 - Your safest option for a failed Kaiohken is burning 1 bar and ending with the x20 Kaiohken kamehameha

Edit: I played some matches and sadly it looks like it's fairly easily counterable, the lack of any kind of invunerability will probably really hurt base Goku as a characterNow, maybe I’m a dumb as duck and in case feel free to tell me so

If Samira was considered too safe because of her dash why not simply make it so she has 2 version of the spell?

Samira standard E only usable against enemies, but if you get a reset you get access to old E

This way Samira would retain the in and out aspect of her original kit but she would still have less safety when not on the offense compared to pre-nerf

....Also a second shaved off ult for every rank doesn’t seem outrageous to me now that they made it 8 secondsIt could surely be an effective nerf but it will feel bad, can we persuade rito to nerf something else? 
(I still believe that they could atleast wait next patch and see how meaningful the hurricane nerf will be)

They can nerf many other things without making her clunky:

 - Cooldowns
 - Mana costs
 - Damage

*I know I already said it, but why the hell can't we wait another 2 weeks for other nerfs? The hurricane one is huge not a lil slap and there aren't even important tournaments in the next 2 weeks, why can't they nerf her one step at a time?Like we all know recently Lifeline got slapped with the nerf bat

Many Lifeline main act like this is unfair because whole her upper body is VERY small ""Lifeline doesn't have an escape"" Like Path or Wraith so she didn't deserve the 5%

Not once I have seen a Lifeline main point out how goddamn strong their passive is, I have used Lifeline a lot in particular in the first months and that passive made me completely turn around fights

Leave alone the ""she is small"" argument, that passive alone will save your ass and already did many times, that 5% extra damage taken will never come close as being impactful as that passive

25% faster heal/shielding baseline and the ability to heal shields and health at the same time without a phoenix kit thanks to DOC is fucking nuts

Regarding drone nerf, everybody now has to play way more around the zone, it wasn't a Lifeline specific nerf, it was making sure to eliminate a crutch so nobody can ignore the zone, even Lifeline players

P.S.= Literally the only character that can spawn purple armorWHENS MY MAN?

The absolute unit, the waifu beater, the one and only

SPOPOVICH!

10% extra damage against females and level 3 is Videl beatdown, he beats Videl so hard that it makes the opponent uncomfortable to the point of making them surrender (Insta kill dramatic finish against Videl)"

Also, this is taken directly from the readme file after the v1.1 patch:
  
    2) Patch 1.1 Corrections

    1.  The process of installing and activating the game is now easier and more stable. SECUROM copy protection
        has been removed entirely, making the game DRM free!
    ...
    4.  Game efficiency has been improved. Game now runs 5-30% more efficiently and game loading has been
        accelerated. Efficiency increases will vary depending on system configuration and game version. Owners of
        boxed versions of The Witcher 2 are likely to notice the greatest improvements.
    5.  Bugs causing the game to crash, especially while saving game progress or loading saved games, have 
        been corrected.
    ...
    9.  The hardware configuration auto-detect function has been corrected, resulting in improved game
        efficiency.
   
To download the patch, go to [http://en.thewitcher.com/patch/](http://en.thewitcher.com/patch/) and select the correct version.  If you bought the game from [GoG.com](http://www.gog.com), then you need to download the patch from your game library, as you would download the bonus items and game itself.

I have found them to be incredibly useful, and if you are even thinking about overclocking, these posts will take you from start to finish, and you'll probably learn something along the way.  No experience required; the guide covers the basics from front to back, including CPU, GPU, and RAM overclocking.

Unfortunately, there aren't many subscribers on that subreddit, so I would like to post it here to try and increase the exposure, because as I have said before, they are *very* helpful and well written.

Going to watch some interracial porn to celebrateI was thinking about Stannis and his purpose in the story, and found that he has many similarities with Daenerys.

Both were 'the rightful heirs' and were motivated by it, and considered the Iron Throne to be their right and duty.

Both were linked to the element of fire, Stannis through Melisandre and her religion and Dany through her dragons. They both burned their enemies.

Both helped Jon against the enemy to the north. Stannis helped against the freefolk and Daenerys against the Dead. Also they were both very influential figures for Jon.

Both had their closest advisors betray them in favor of Jon Snow (Melisandre and Tyrion/Varys).

And they both held Dragonstone as their base of operations.

They both lost their parents, and two brothers. They were directly involved in the death of the younger ones. (Renly killed by Melisandre, Viserys killed by Drogo while Dany watched)

Dany brought foreign forces of Dothraki and the Unsullied, and Stannis brought a foreign religion. These things made them look like outsiders to their enemies.

I think this is not a coincidence, and Stannis' fate was a warning of what will happen to Daenerys, and that being a rightful heir is not enough to be a good rulerSometimes you want to stun and run away and backpacking the scepter every time is a clunky solution, not to mention it's impossible with the Aghanim's Blessing.


But most importantly, if you're a Rubick with Aghs, Storm Hammer turns from an S tier ability to quite situational, because it puts you out of position

This will keep me playing until next year!Hi,

Just been chatting with some colleagues at work about what little tricks, combos of ingredients we use to make a roast chicken our own, and it got me thinking what you folks all do to make it your signature roast?

Colleague of mine puts sliced chorizo under the skin of the chicken along the breast which sounds amazing - I do sliced lemon in the same way with a generous rub of butter and salt.

What's your roast?I am terrible for buying new books, I always end up buying new (to me) books from charity shops and ebay and having a to read pile as tall as me.

However over 2021, I set a challenge where I put £5 in a savings account for every book I finished, and £2.50 for every film I watched.

Coming up to the end of the year I had £445 put aside, and now that is my budget for books in 2022. 

It's already made me reframe how I buy books etc now, as I have this limited pot to buy from, rather than just coming from my (still limited but bigger) wages.  Now if I want to top up the book budget, I have to make headway on the books I already have to top it up.

I know this is not nobuy in its purest form, but its creating a limit to buying new things and also forces me to read my books I have, where they've got lost on the shelves.

One thing I am adding is £10 for every video game finished, and any new video games will come out of this budget too.

What do you guys think? I quite like the self gamification / incentive to use what I have whilst also allowing myself to buy things occassionally."

rtyuuytr,1,6,"If you have a gun that you no longer need, you should downgrade all the parts to the base model. This way you can keep and store all the upgrades for your next gun of the same type.

If you salvage the gun, ALL the upgrades will be salvage as well. You will only get a small portion of your starting material.This post has been inspired by Clan AZZ's deck list post. Just wanted to post the decks I've collected throughout the years playing TESL. Most of these are relatively up to date and do not contain classic decks that have been nerfed to unplayable status (Doomcrag, Market, Nix-Ox, etc).

All of these decks are designed to be competitive, but some are more competitive than others. Drop a code if you want your deck added. Hope this can serve as a resource for newer players looking for classic (forgotten) decks that are still playable.

1. Invade is still horribly powerful against decks without counter to gates. Forcing every deck in the meta to run counters to a niche deck with polarizing matchups is the antithesis of TCG design. 

2. Polarized matchups is NOT the definition of balance. Just because a deck has internal win rates of around 50% (or 40-60%) doesn't mean it is balanced. Decks that auto-win or auto-lose due to matchup should not exist in a healthy TCG metagame. Extreme win rate variance = BAD.

3. Invade is a horrible experience to play against because fundamentally, it is a deck archetype with core mechanic rooted in RNG. 

4. Invade has been nerfed to be linear. The currently viable invade decks rely on just spamming the field with invade cards while hoping that your opponent cannot counter the gates since double gating has been nerfed to unplayable status. 

5. Not a single player in the game enjoys playing against invade.

6. The nerfs have not done enough to make invade a ""healthy mechanic"". This would involve a near complete rework of the core invade mechanic. In its current form, invade is simply horrible horrible experience for any player in a game with invade deck."

Aside from the core value of having a discrete set of symbols to represent our written communication system (ie alphabet), the ambiguity can also lead to some serious problems. In computer security, usernames and websites can now be spoofed by this simple trick (eg by pointing someone to hotmaiI.com rather than to hotmail.com). Passwords may become confused or lost due to this simple affect as well.

We should therefore eschew these fonts. Since I know we won't, I really do want you to CMV.

That said, the Canadian soldiers recently killed are receiving an undue amount of compassion and attention. Sports events are opening with tributes, flags are being flown, and American-style jingoism is mounting.

[A total of 158 Canadian Forces personnel have been killed in the Afghanistan war since 2002.](http://www.icasualties.org/OEF/index.aspx) And yet a couple soldiers die on home turf and this is a game-changer. 

We now have [tear-jerking articles about a dead soldier's dogs](http://mashable.com/2014/10/23/canadian-soldiers-dogs-cirillo/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link). This qualifies as selective empathy. When has anyone cared so much in Canada for those who have died in action - often people who were not soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the greater good.

I firmly believe that this kind of selective empathy, when coupled with media fanning and fawning, is toxic for our society and resultant local and international policy.

I just got an iPhone 8 after having an iPhone 5 for over four years. Naturally I thought I'd have some issues playing on a bigger phone but I seem to have a problem with the screen rotating on its own. Basically as soon as I start playing a song the screen will rotate 180  degrees and then when it's over it will rotate back. It only happens when I play a song, meaning when it's on the main screen or the inventory screen or anywhere else it stays the same. Does anyone else have this problem and, if so, how can I fix it? It's not a huge problem technically, it's just annoying. I hope I explained this clearly.I have my top 4 figured out (Wonder Girls, miss A, Sunmi and 15&) but I'm not sure about the last group.

But I'm not sure if it's worth it considering there are nine members. Does anyone here have Twice in their top5? Are you satisfied with it? So it seems like the New Years' Mission is following the XMas Mission format. The Premium Missions are slightly more doable (yesterday you had to spend 100k instead of 200k, easy to do with burning time). Today you have to spend 200 diamonds (in the XMas Mission you had to spend 500 diamonds), which is ok considering tomorrow you'll get diamonds in the Play Mission. However, I have no clue what you'll have to do tomorrow for the Premium Mission. In Xmas Mission you had to collect either XMas or Merry S or R cards. Any guesses? "

Seriously it works absolutely flawlessly and is by far the greatest selling point for the app. Other browsers are litteraly unusable for me at this point.Most of us here probably use bitcoin for many different reasons, but I believe that there is one reason that us early adopters all share: We love the decentralized nature of bitcoin. 

When I say early adopters, I am referring to all of you reading this. That's right, every single one! 

We all took the initiative to invest in a technology not yet fully developed, a technology which role in our society is not yet known. We didn't do it because we had to, or because everyone else where doing it; we did it because we believe in it. 

Using a service like coinbase effectively shows the world that the very essence of bitcoin, the very reason we started using is, doesn't matter to you. 

Using a service like coinbase is analogous to when people first started using banks to store their gold, and it's because of this that our financial system looks the way it looks today.

Mind you, people didn't have much choice back then, as the alternative was to store the gold yourself.

We have at our disposal a currency specifically designed to eliminate the need for a third party, yet many entities flaunt many features in order to hopefully be accepted as one, and we can't really blame them. 

This is an anarchic system, and if bitcoin becomes what as big as we all want it to become, people are gonna want to have control over at least some part of it and if we accept such an entity, the oligarchs of today are gonna be able to control it. 

It isn't hard to imagine a future where the only bitcoin transactions accepted are the ones through coinbase or coinkite. 

This time we have a choice and I employ you early adopters, you who care about bitcoin abs want it to succeed, to help keep bitcoin decentralized.  "

Thanks.Edit: Thanks so much for all of your comments. I think I'll be revising my theory. I think many of you are likely right about my over reliance on mantles. I'm thinking that there is still something to (1) the idea that Mother Winter gave the Blackstaff to someone in the Council to help fight the Adversary, (2) the Winter Court being somehow connected to the creation of Demonreach by Merlin, and (3) the idea that the Gatekeeper is connected to the Winter Court (and may be a mantle). /Edit

As a preface, I just read the series for the second time in preparation for reading Skin Game, which I just finished. I have not been lurking on this subreddit before a few days ago, so I apologize if my theory is old hat at this point.

TL:DR: The Blackstaff is Mother Winter’s walking stick, therefore each of the titles held by someone on the White Council is a mantle provided by the Winter Court. 

Longer TL:DR: The White Council is an immune system for reality. Each of the titles of a member of the White Council is actually a mantle that passes between wizards: the Gatekeeper, the Merlin, the Blackstaff, and the Warden. The Blackstaff is a mantle passed down by Mother Winter (it’s her walking stick) to the White Council and is meant to provide a wizard with the ability to kill mortals that have become infected by the Adversary without breaking the laws of magic. The purpose of each mantle is to support the Winter Court in keeping the Adversary Out.

The reason that I began falling down this rabbit whole is because I reread the section where Mother Summer tells Harry that Mother Winter lost her walking stick. Mother Winter is likely the most badass of the badasses. Unlike beings like the Lords of Outer Night, who could kill you by squashing you with the physical manifestation of their will, Mother Winter can likely just stop mortals from being alive by sheer force of will, without having to go to the trouble of causing her will to be physically manifested. She just thinks die and, *poof*, you die: or, that’s how I imagine it. So, what would be a good walking stick for her to have? The Blackstaff, which clearly has a similar power. I’ll admit: that is the only evidence I have for that part of my theory. However, once I had the thought, I was almost certain it had to be the case. It just *feels* true. 

Please tell me what you think of that idea. It is largely an independent idea from the word-vomit-of-crazy that follows.

From there, I also realized that two of the other titles held by White Council wizards are also tied in to the Winter Court’s constant struggle to keep the Adversary Out: (most obviously) the Gatekeeper and (less obviously) the Warden. I think it is likely, therefore, that Mother Winter gave the Blackstaff to the White Council in order to provide the White Council with another tool to help with the fight against the Adversary. 

I’ll detail a little why I think each of the roles was built to support the Winter Court’s struggle against the Outsiders. 

* First, the Gatekeeper: this seems pretty obvious. Rashid literally supports the Winter Court’s troops on the front lines. He tries to keep any sleeper agents from coming back from the battle. He likely does other stuff for Mab’s efforts. I theorize that the Gatekeeper is a mantle, just like the Winter Knight is a mantle. If Rashid were to die, someone would take his place in the same way. I think it likely that the Winter Court is responsible for the position existing at all, just like the Winter Knight. 

* Second, the Warden: Merlin created Demonreach to contain any of the Outsiders, Old Gods, etc. that were not killable. By doing so, he created a new mantle of power to ensure that there would be someone that could contain any nasties that got by the Gatekeeper. I think the Winter Court was likely involved in this operation in a way that Harry hasn’t realized, yet. Later, the White Council created the wardens to support the Warden, perhaps going out and capturing entities to imprison under Demonreach. I can’t think of any other way that Merlin would have gotten that many bad guys down there. I’m not sure how involved the Winter Court would have been in the creation of those roles or the island or putting the bad guys down there. However, I find it hard to believe that the Winter Court played no role in it because the fact that so many bad guys are down in Demonreach just helps Mab’s mission out *so much*. I just can’t consider it a coincidence.

* Third, the Blackstaff: I already hinted at this above. I think the Blackstaff is Mother Winter’s workaround for the Laws of Magic. She gave up her walking stick to provide wizards the ability to just straight up kill anyone that they thought was Infected. Without that, the White Council would have a much harder time trying to rid itself of members who had become tainted. 

* Lastly, the Merlin: Based on the above, I also theorize that the Merlin’s role is more than just keeping the White Council from imploding and ensuring that the Laws of Magic are enforced. I think Harry may eventually learn that the Merlin has many more responsibilities than he initially thought—just like Rashid. I think it might also be the case that “Merlin” is also a mantle.

I had died maybe a handful of times until those spinning skeletons. Fuck. Them. Spinny. Skele. I've played all the souls games twice, Sekiro, Bloodborne twice. And damn if getting out of the Tomb wasn't one of the hardest things I've done. It's done. I'm out. But oh man. How does anyone deal with a soul level one playthrough in that area. Everything killed me. Arrows, big skele, every spinny boy, even wisps! I hate it! I love blightown compared to that shit. I never understood the blightown complaints. But the Tomb felt like a brick wall. 

And yes. I got the skull lantern. No, I don't have light. Going for a cleric build and I am really trying to keep the SL low so I don't mess up being able to summon in initially.

Anyway. I fucking love this game. Have a lovely day.I purchase the following ingredients from Sam's Club, [cut everything up] (http://i.imgur.com/5fLdS1T.jpg), and then [package in zip lock bags with as much air removed as possible] (http://i.imgur.com/UErPZ3b.jpg):

* Taylor Farms - Coleslaw (Raw) $1.98
* Earthbound Farm - Organic Baby Spinach $4.48
* Eat Smart - Beneforte Broccoli $3.98 (I usually only use half the bag for the salad; the other half ends up steamed or in stir fries).
* Taylor Farms - Romaine Lettuce $3.98

It usually lasts for two weeks, often longer. It totals about 900 calories. I usually eat about 13 full-meal sized salads out of the whole thing. 

Hope you all find this helpful.I created four profiles that work in tandem to allow you to check your missed calls and texts when you don't have access to your phone but it is on. You need the SendSilentMail app.

Whenever you miss a call or any text comes in, the first two profiles write the details of the event into a text file. The third profile allows you to access that log by texting yourself the message ""activate log"" from any phone number. SendSilentMail then emails the log to the mail of your choice. The last profile clears the log whenever the screen is unlocked. 

I'll put the XML in the comments.

fishmoth,6,9,"I'm starting to realize that this is why my life so far seems like an empty husk compared to other people I meet. If I want to do something that has any social element to it, regardless of whether it's something productive or fun, the anxiety kicks in and there's a voice that tells me ""nope, we're not doing that!"", or I come up with some non-anxiety reason not to do it and pretend that that's the real reason. Either way, overcoming this and doing the thing takes a bunch of effort, so naturally things get avoided. If you spread that pattern of avoidance out over many years, you end up as a person who hasn't done much, can never come up with a good story, and just lacks life experience in general, which further makes you feel different and inadequate compared to other people, making you want to avoid those feelings by not doing things, turning it into a vicious cycle. 

I'm 27 years into this now and the only thing I can take away from this realization is that I should try to force myself out more, with the hopes that constant exposure makes it easier to not avoid things. I wanted to share this here in case someone was having those same self-critical feelings. It might not be ""you"", it could just be that years of anxiety, social or otherwise, have made you avoid anything that would make you feel like your life seem interesting, normal, or accomplished. Those little avoidances really pile up. However, I've definitely overcome this in some areas before simply with lots of exposure, so I'm pretty sure it's possible. In a weird way it's kinda uplifting, the idea that maybe there's nothing wrong with *me*, but that it's just the choices I've made. I can make different choices and be, or at least feel, like a better person.My job as a software engineer has thoroughly bled into the rest of my life. Every sprint feels like a nightmare and I regularly have to take my laptop home to catch up on the nights and weekends. So far I’ve been able to deliver, but it’s cost me almost all my free time. It’s mostly my fault though, my ability to focus for lengthy periods of time is really bad. Even if I’m not actively distracting myself, my mind wanders. I think my job could technically be kept within business hours if I was more like a robot who could just code and respond to emails and go to meetings without getting tired or distracted or having emotional ups and downs, but that’s not me in my current state. What to do?As I understand it, scientists believe that all life on earth has a common ancestor, which formed through natural processes billions of years ago. Why is it that this only happened once? Just like there are different species, why aren't there different, unrelated trees of organisms that originated in a different time/place? If life really only sprung up once on a planet as fertile as ours, doesn't that mean that it's probably extremely rare throughout the universe as well?Okay not that old, about to turn 30. But with each year that passes I find myself wanting to opt out of things everyone else finds fun or treats as goals, because I see all the pitfalls and just don’t think it’s worth the effort/risk. But while this started with things like dating, caring about politics, or drinking excessively, it’s spread to pretty much all other aspects of life to the point where all I care about is doing well at work and accomplishing goals like getting in shape or getting rich. It’s not bad really, and I don’t consider myself to be depressed, but sometimes it seems like a progressive disease where eventually I’ll just be a neutral blob who doesn’t care about anything and doesn’t see anything as worth doing. Is there a name for this?This seems to happen over and over. I'll have some idea for a programming project that I'm really excited about, then I start working on it, and the more time that goes on, the less excited I am about it, and the more I think the idea was fundamentally not very good all along. Eventually I lose all motivation because working on it just feels like throwing time and energy down the drain. I have a graveyard of incomplete projects. What is this?"

Briguy24,3,4,"I began a series rewatch just like a lot of other and while I was in S1 I read the theories here that MIB is already on a loop in S2.  I began my S2 rewatch open to that idea and keeping my eye open to any evidence one way or another.  

Since the beginning of this season MIB is absolutely certain he's playing a game that Ford made specifically for him.  He's not.  It's a test alright, but a test of his fidelity created by the Supreme Dolores.  Ford never once told him that he made a game for him.  Ford was consistent that his games were for the hosts in S1.  Why suddenly set this abrupt 180 after his death?  Makes no sense unless we think if it is a test... who is running it and what it the purpose?


Some others have posted here with their proof already.  I can't find a video link to the scene near the end of S2E4 where MIB and Lawrence's daughter speak but I had texted it to a friend.

MIB: 'You wanted me to play your game... and I'm going to play it to the bone.'

Young Girl: 'You don't understand the game we're playing.  If you're looking forward you're looking in the wrong direction.'

[When Arnold explained the journey to consciousness in S1 to Dolores he explained it not as a journey higher but a journey inward.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRIt9cQdScA&ab_channel=Futurescope)

In this scene MIB is on a loop in the future.  His decisions this time are to help Lawrence and funny enough the mccguffin is the same nitro that we saw Young William and Logan steal S1.  It's like Doloroes created another test for MIB with the same constants (the same hosts and the same nitro).  This time MIB makes a good choice and goes on."

Kubernetes security is a bottomless topic and k8s itself already has a steep learning curve. My attempt in this thesis is to put together and overview of the most important angles and tools there are for managing Kubernetes security with a focus on container breakouts, intrusion detection and abuse of containers once inside.

All the way from basic RBAC to gVisor Kernel Hardening.

Here is my table of contents. I'm at over 15,000 words.

kifferella,7,4,"Many many moons ago I had an acquaintance on a forum post a picture of a porn stars' genitals. Her caption was along the lines of, ""Look at how blown out her pussy is! Lol, what a whore! I'd be so embarrassed if I'd damaged myself like that with so much cock!""

This was a woman, talking about another woman's genitals. 

That was the first time I ever admitted, publicly, that my vagina, my labia, my genitals, whatever fucking blanket term you want to use for it... looked like the model in the pictures. 

And I remember being 11 or 12, in the bath, as my labia had started to change due to menarche, asking my mother to look and tell me what was wrong with me. And she said, ""Just don't touch it. I'm sure you'll be fine."" Nobody had told me that prepubescent children have basically only outer, major labia, and the inner, minor labia develop during puberty. I was confused and worried. 

And yet that ""blown out porn star pussy"" is what grew in on me, despite judiciously keeping my hands to myself lest I make it ""worse"". At 11/12. Go on and lecture me about my overuse of my genitals at that age. 

Except they did get used before then. At 6/7 I was lured out of a park by a pedophile and raped. 

And so my completely virginal, innocent junk was used by this man in a very violent and ugly way. 

And guess what the long term obviously visually physical effects were. FUCKING NOTHING.

According to ""Overuse by a Whore"" theory, my barely elementary school aged vagina should have been absolutely wrecked by this ""Chad"" of a cock that I probably secretly loved. I should have had beef curtains hanging to my knees after what he did to me. After all, the desecration of female genitals by large toys or penises is what causes that. 

I shudder, and fully admit, there will be people who fully believe it must have been some sort of 5 year delayed fuse on the consequences of my not knowing that an adult man saying my mom had sent him, his kids wanted to play with me, he had strawberries at home, and he was going to give me a bike was just me justifying my own thirsty nature. 

After all, have you seen my junk? Clearly that sort of girl.

I talk like this and men and women alike suddenly are uncomfortable and upset. Fuck em. Its absurd and bizarre. And if you're perfectly comfortable scoffing about some random lady's labia in a public setting I will absolutely maddog you while demanding you explain why my rapist as a child didn't ""blow my pussy out"" and why my vagina changed significantly during menarche despite not being touched at all. 

Go on. Explain it. I'm waiting.[removed]That we girls were not allowed on the trampoline if we were menstruating. 

When we asked why, he glared and snarled: ""You *know* why!"". We did not. The more we asked, the angrier he got. Attempts to reassure him that neither we nor the trampoline were in danger were to no avail. Eventually we called in the school nurse and the other (female) gym teacher. 

So we all got to watch him have a meltdown as he accused them both of knowing damn well why menstruating girls can't use a trampoline and being ""disgusting"" for trying to make him ""say it out loud"".

Never did find out what he was on about. But it sure does boggle the imagination, even 30+ years later...Just remembered this thanks to a post on another sub. 

At 18 I got my first tattoo. It was on my hip. Bathing suit visible, regular clothes covered. 

Off we go to a festival. I am hanging out with some friends and we are in bathing suits. Up flies my mother, in a panic. 

The issues:

- people can SEE my tattoo. They will KNOW.

- she had friends here. She doesn't want her friends to know. 

- it's okay for MY friends to know. They don't matter. HER friends are GOOD people. 

- They will judge her.

- They will judge me.

- but mostly her. 

- tattoos are trashy. Only drug addicted biker whores get tattoos.

Conclusion: I must cover it up immediately, because shame. 

At this point a lady my mother's age comes up to us. She asks if I am the girl who just got a tattoo. I am. 

""See!? See!? People are TALKING!"" laments Mom. 

Lady cocks her head at my mother, checks out my tattoo and calls it charming and then turns around and pulls down the back of her dress. 

There, HUGE, between her shoulder blades and nape of her neck is The Sun from The Sun tarot card. 

""I just got this two months ago, to celebrate being cancer free!""

Well fuck. It is an AMAZING tattoo and makes mine look like the sort of teeny shit a nervous 18yo gets because they've half bought into the idea they'll end up regretting it (might be accurate, lol)

So I get that wolfish grin on and turn to Mom and say, ""Aren't you going to let her know about the judging and the drug addicted trashy biker whore she is making herself look like?""

Poor ole Mom gawped and stammered through a good ten minute lecture from this lovely lady about how silly she was being and that's the sort of stupid she might expect from someone too old to learn or grow, not someone their age and that anyone paying any attention knows how mainstream tattoos are and did she know Winston Churchill's MOTHER had a tattoo (snake around her wrist, which I also have now) and she needn't presume to be the guardian of good taste and social rules if she was going to suck this bad at it.My eight year old son was at my exes and got hit with a belt. His twin stepsisters (2 yo twins) woke up too early.  430am.  X was woken up. He lost his shit. He smacked one twin in terms cheek with a backhand and then took off his belt and hit her in the ribs. 

He then asked ""anyone else want one!!""

My son said he did. 8 years old. He did it because he wasn't entirely sure that unless he was personally hurt, I'd make a complaint (I would have). So he took a whack to make sure. To protect his stepsisters. 

The report is made. The new girlfriend did freak out on him. It won't ever happen again.  The family is now being supervised. Because of my 8 yo son. 

He is one of the bravest people I've ever known. I am so proud.

EDIT: So this blew up more than I ever really thought possible. I have read your comments to Piglet, redacting any negative stuff about his dad. He is especially keen on all the folks who are encouraging me to take him out for sweet delicious foodstuffs. It shall be done. 

To the person who suggested xmas presents, that is so very sweet but unnecessary. This year we're doing a rather austere, non-commercial Christmas (read: I'm broke, lol!) and our plan is for each sibling to get a small set amount to spend on each other sibling. So it'll be more about personality and choice than blowing a wad. A life lesson, so to speak. We've had plenty of fat Christmases. This one will just be special in a different way.

To the person who asked why X had his belt on... One does not become the asshole who hit a 2yo with a belt without having once been that two year old - AND WORSE. I suppose to my ex a belt is a lot better than some other things. Throughout our marriage he ALWAYS slept fully dressed. I managed after several years to get him to remove his sneakers in bed. I leave it to you all to interpret what that might mean. 

I am trying to maintain a sort of ... educational attitude about all this... which is not to say that my first impulse wasn't to turn the van around and ram it up his ass. But I don't want Piglet's relationship with his father destroyed. It is still a valuable one. I just want my X to understand without equivocation that this will never, ever fucking happen again, to our son or ANY other child in his care. With the deepest respect and affection, I'll report them every goddamn time. My niece has been having a rough time. She came to spend the night two weeks ago and brought her toutou (stuffed animal). Shes 13, my son is about to turn 14, they're buds.

The toutou ended up accidentally left at my house. Y

My son, who is ADHD and can be a little anxious/hyperfocused has been obsessed with getting her toutou back to her. I get at least one comment a day about if I should call her mother to swing by on the way home from work, when we might next see them next, etc.

Today was my MILs bday and the family was over. Including nieces older/cool friends from down the road. At first my son was all, ""Good, I can get her her stuffed doggy back!""

And then, without prompting, he was like, ""It's not happening today. I approached her privately and she looked scared and peeked over at her friends. So I told her not to worry about it, I was keeping her toutou safe and I'd get it back to her when her friends werent around.""

Then followed a bit of a rant/lecture about how even some grownups have toutous and it's really not that big a deal, but if it embarrasses her, he'll claim it as his own if they see it/tease.

Aww. 

He's been like this his whole life. Just naturally empathetic and thoughtful in a way a lot of adults arent even. I love him.So my oldest kid is trans. The timeline of raising a trans child goes like so:

Age 2 - he wears a dress for the last time. A flower girl's dress to my SIL's wedding. He had to be sewn into it. The deal was if he didn't rip it off in disgust, he would never be asked to wear a dress/skirt/pink ever again. He grouchily agrees.

Age 4 - by this time we are aware he is autistic. He doesn't like his (fucking beautiful) hair. Long, blonde RINGLETS. He begs for ""short hair"". I finally agree (I really liked that hair. Mine grows out of my skull straight out like a fluffy, non-curly afro, and is the colour of dead mice sometimes, and sometimes reddish?) I cut his curls off and the next morning he is distressed because ""his penis didn't grow in""

Age 11 - He's now known for years the divisions of human sexuality (orientation, gender,presentation etc) and that all of these things are on spectrums. That any combination of these things are fine. He can be a fairly masculine woman who is straight, a lesbian who is not, trans but not interested in surgeries, etc - and that he has time enough to figure all these things out as he matures and learns about himself and his needs and desires. He's pretty sure he likes girls, and maintains that some day he will be a man. Groovy. 

My attitude during these years is that who you are at 8 has little to do with who you are at 18. Take your time. Make few proclamations, but if you do, you are not married to them. You have a lot of growing and changing to do, and anything is possible. I will love and accept any of it, and any time. This will be a fun journey, no matter where you end up. 

Age 15 - He transitions to male. Gets his boy-name on his birthday. Switches pronouns. We don't do anything legally, but he is now ""out"" to all family, friends and community. I gird my loins to mama-bear the fuck out of anyone who hurts him, to no point. Everyone (even the doubtful) are supportive. Least supportive: Local Children's Services, up our business due to autism issues... They are pain in ass. 

We see psychiatrist who panics, ""I'm not qualified for this! I don't know this stuff!"" and kiddo attempts to *guide him*, lol ""Don't worry! I can teach you all about it!"". Small town psych nopes out. Family doctor is intrigued. We attend local gender diversity clinic. They offer lupron (puberty blocker) and we refuse. Myself because I believe there are hormonally driven intellectual maturations my son would benefit from with his autism, and him because needles freak him the fuck out. Also, being FTM, I am not making him have to get expensive, painful electrolysis... 

Clinic tells us to treat the fear of needles and go see an endocrinologist at age 18, as my son doesn't seem to really need their services as he is not confused, frightened, unsure, or needing help figuring this shit out. He's just a boy, lol. Cool Beans.

Age 18 - Although now old enough to start process, son opts to wait a bit in order to (*ahem*) explore his sexuality. My advice has always been to use his bits at least the once or twice as-is. 

Age 20 - This is now! Son is now on a waiting list for a mastectomy and we went to the endocrinologist this week. And here's what happened: Apparently most of her patients come in, as adults, and are YEARS behind my child in terms of transitioning. Some haven't even told their parents yet. She generally requires a near 2 year wait so that a transition plan can be come up with, living as your chosen gender, coming out to your community, finding your support, visiting psychiatrists and specialists. She is *thrilled* that my son has *already done all these things*. She marches about talking about how THIS is how it should work. That it's so wonderful to meet someone who has only ever faced love and acceptance. She orders the bloodwork, and schedules the first shot of testosterone for the end of the month. 

So second puberty starts, Sept 2017! Bracing for acne and mood swings so so so much body hair. Younger brother is pleased he has three year head start on his beard. A Tata to the Titties party is planned for before the mastectomy. And me? After years... *decades* of being told I was indulging or encouraging a stage, etc... I can rest easy knowing he is grown and has made his choices based on his own needs and desires, knowing and having always known, that no matter what he chooses, I will always love him. 

EDIT: So I read all of this to him, as while it's mainly about my experiences as a parent, I am sharing an awful lot of info about him so I wanted to make sure I'd not overstepped anywhere.

And I got the autism holy grail: The *unsolicited hug*! Woohoo!!

And thanks so much for the gold! I am not just typing this on my phone on account of being day-drunk before 11am. Although it may be a contributing factor. 

When I had my kids a well-meaning relative gave me ""what to expect when you're expecting and also the next one with a further three years or something"".

This book did nothing for me. 

And right now... I just want to talk to all the young ladies with their precious little tater-monkeys wondering if they're causing irreparable harm swaddling too tight or not know THE FUCK IS SWADDLING?

Sixteen years from now that precious little bundle of yellow poop and lamb-noises is going to have a full beard and say, I shit you not:

I need a ride to Liam's house tomorrow. And ten head of lettuce. For a video. Its not sexual. I swear. 

Wanna know WHY I got tasked to procuring ten heads of lettuce for obvious fucking woodsy vegisexual porn? I'm apparently ""the cool mom"". I'm on a fixed fucking income you lol bastards! I'm disabled! What the fuck!?

So please... Take a moment out of your days of stress and anxiety and worry for your precious little babies and think less, ""what am I doing that will harm this innocent creature?"" and remember in very short order they are going to smell like a goat and do unspeakable things with coconuts and they will be traumatizing you RIGHT THE FUCK BACK.

Its the long game, baby. Always remember it's the long game.My son is turning 13 in a few days and has been NC with his father for several years. There was an incident where he belted his then 4yo stepdaughter and then raged ""anyone else want one!?"" And my then ... I think he was 9?yo son volunteered as, ""I had to be sure you would call CPS"". I did. Reassured him that i always would, even for his stepsisters or strangers without his having to take a licking.

Ex did his parenting classes and anger management and mea culpas with CPS while simultaneously accusing son and me of lying with us. Son then spent 6 months wresting an apology out of him and told him that if he ever did it again, he would cut contact. 

A year or so later ex was removed from the home for doing it again. Kiddo went NC. He did his classes and shit again and was back within a couple of months.

But in my exes happy thoughts place, he didnt fuck up and hurt a child AGAIN while simultaneously breaking a solemn vow he had made to his son. He is the victim of parental alienation. I am just a big ole meany bitch keeping his son from him. He managed to convince at least one of the stepsons I spent 7 years raising part time of this tale. My other stepson didnt buy it but didnt confront it either. Contact with them has been pretty sporadic. 

But a couple of weeks ago the younger stepson contacted me and said he and older stepson wanted to see kiddo for his birthday. I agreed immediately, of course. It would be the first time kiddo had seen them in years! I gave them a gift idea, and here's what we negotiated/I was led to believe would happen: 

They would come over at 1030ish. Surprise him, give him a gift. I thought they would be driving (20 and 17 now). They mentioned taking him out to lunch but then said they were being dropped off so would just order something in. They would spend the afternoon. 

Yesterday they came. And were driven by my exes new wife. She dont like me, and she *hates* kiddo (its ""his fault"" she had to deal with CPS??). I'm not her biggest fan. Not really a fan of anyone who chooses dick over their kids' safety. And she sat there... in the car.. in the driveway... just. Sat. There. 

Kiddo was thrilled to see his brothers! Thrilled with his present. Then looked up and saw her in the van. Is that NewWife? Why is she just sitting there? Is dad with her?

Oldest stepson says, ""Dad decided it wasnt a good idea to come. He didnt want to start trouble."" That last bit he looked at ME while he said it. 

Good to know the fiction that I'm the driving force behind the estrangement is still going strong. 

I just turned to my FIL (my new ILs live next door, but they're very JustYes) and said, ""That was very thoughtful of him. We planned this as a surprise. Maybe kiddo would have been okay with it, but if he had gotten mad and stomped off inside, well that's not much of a visit for anyone.""

Kiddo just shrugged. 

But the answer to why NewWife was sitting in the van was because they changed the plan - they wanted to take him back out to eat again. With NewWife... ugh.

Off they go. 

And then... of course... I start getting all sorts of texts about how he is eating more than both older bros, lol. Yeah. Hes grown 4"" in the past 6 months. You should see my grocery bill. Its unreal how much this kid can eat. Make it a Chinese buffet and hes gonna do some damage. But hes doing this in front of *her*.

So prediction: I will be visited by CPS in the next month for ""starving kid"".

Anyways... if you're still with me you're likely going ""Cool story, Kifferella, but this is JustNoSO, no?""

They ""got lost"" on the way back. Gosh. They ""got lost"" right near exes place. Gosh. We could just... pop in! Say hi to dad! Dad sure would appreciate it. Dad sure does miss you (not enough to like.. keep a promise not to beat children or call him or apologize or reach out in any of 100 ways...). We really ought to. Gosh. 

Had he disagreed with both big bros making puppy dog eyes at him I have no doubt NewWife would have something she conveniently had to stop by home for...

So he saw his dad.

And then they brought him home (suddenly those whole two turns to get out of one of only three ways out of town were much less confusing!)... and left immediately. After all, now that project Make Kiddo See His Father had been successful, NewWife's patience for sitting in a van in my driveway was exhausted. 

It was all a fucking trick. The first time they come see him, the first time they reach out on a birthday, the first time they get him something... it was just so he could be manipulated into giving his father what HE wanted. 

Not impressed over here. 

Luckily kiddo is shrugging it off as he got free Chinese food and some cash in a card (from The Dalek on JustNoMIL and her husband) and a cool present. No harm, no foul. But I doubt he'll ever go anywhere with them again and if he does, I'll be giving him my cell phone so he can call me if they try to pressure or machinate him into seeing his father again. 

""Hey mom? They need to drop by Dad's. I'll have them drop me off at the park, come pick me up!"" Boom. Problem solved.I was noodling about on Reddit and read an article about Anthony Bourdain making purposefully gross food and putting it into McDonalds packaging to get his daughter to dislike McDonalds. 

A commenter then said something along the lines that if you lie to your children, you're a shit parent and your kids will figure out you were a shit parent who lied instead of teaching them real things (paraphrased). OP commented something along the lines of ""Yup. Religion in a nutshell."" (Daaaamn)

But before that sentiment got derailed... I was kinda like... wait... what?

See, i told eldest at 3 that if he was quiet and observant, he might see a dinosaur or wild pokemon (things he was into) in the forests of Ontario. That was a Montreal-Edmonton bus ride and he survived! Mostly because he spent hours just intently watching out the windows. He saw bear. Moose. Deer. Some were even alive!

I told a lot of lies like that. All the time. 

But I've also met parents who won't even do Santa or the Easter Bunny because its ""lies"". 

And what about that savage religion comment? What about things YOU believe, that others believe are lies? Is the lady who adopts a 9yo who just lost his parents that they are burning in eternal torment because they never married or went to church being a ""good parent by telling the truth"" simply because *she believes it*? 

What about the shit we tell kids that's just wrong? When I was a kid Pluto was a planet. My older kids started school thinking that there were 9 planets in our solar system, because that's what I had been taught. 

It's a sticky wicket, isnt it? I liked my lies. I thought they were lovely. I never told ugly lies, even when they were self-serving and prevented me from going stir crazy and throttling a 3yo on a 3 day cross country bus trip. 

They always grow out of the lies. It always gets to the point where they just squint at you and say, ""You think you're so smart, Mom. I know what you're trying to do."" Sigh. But I swear there is TOTALLY a sense of accomplishment and quiet pride in getting the kitchen clean! I SWEAR IM NOT MAKING IT UP. Oh well, I tried. But we still have to clean the kitchen. 

My oldest son is 21 now. He's told me that there was a period of time (basically preschool) where the world was truly a magical place. With fairies and gnomes sneaking about just out of sight behind flowers. Where Mom could talk to squirrels and the ""tch tch tch"" noise that I taught him was squirrel for ""I've got a nice peanut for you"". That trees were deep slow thinkers and watched over us. That they were listening to him when he talked to them.

Discovering the world is a little more prosaic than that, he didn't mind it because it wasnt like ""LIES!!"" - It was more like it doesn't matter if there are fairies or not or the trees might not even know you're there because you don't really get to interact with them very meaningfully anyway. 

I don't really think I damaged them. I don't think it's as black and white as lies=evil."
sayleanenlarge,2,3,"When I'm watching most videos (except asmr really) I have to watch it at faster than normal because normal is way too slow and boring. 1.5x is good if it's a new and slightly difficult subject, but if it's easy to understand, only 2x is fast enough and sometimes I wish it had even faster. 

I'm not sure if I'm taking the info on board properly at that speed, but I feel like I understand it better than when it's slow because slow (which is actually normal speed) makes me drift off. 

It's also made me realise how slow people talk, with all their pauses and filler words. Sometimes I'm really rude to people I know well because I do that 'wrap it up' hand signal (like wind the bobbin up if anyone knows that kid's song) because I'm impatient with them. I quite often tell them to spit it out and stop going around the houses.[removed]"
SweelFor,3,9,"Sorry I know it's not a question and it's ranting but honestly I don't understand why so many posts over here are ""my kitten does this normal and predictable kitten behaviour, how do I stop him?"".

Well... how did you prepare yourself for getting this cat in the first place? This sub has some good questions that I like reading and I like reading the answers to, but it also has a lot of posts that make it look like the owner did not put even 1 hour into learning about cats before getting one.

Cats and kittens are not just an easier version of the more demanding and dependant dogs. They have their full sets of needs and wants and things that you NEED to learn and understand to respect them as animals and give them the best life you can.

They can not be considered as a cute little animal that you will feed and pet and clean their litter box and be done. I am sometimes concerned that when I read questions on this sub that seems to be the representation that the owners have of their cat.

From the top of my head here is a list of cat needs that people who do not make the effort of informing themselves about will be ignorant of:

- Exactly how to feed them (wet/dry/raw, free feeding/timed feeding, bowl/foraging toys, etc)

- Need for verticality in their territory (cat trees/shelves/furniture)

- Need to choose and place their litter box(es) correctly

- Need to interact with them in a correct manner (pet your cat when he is happy to be pet, he is not an object that you can pet when it pleases you with no concern for him)

- Need to play with them correctly and frequently (interactive vs solo toys, rotating toys regularly, improvising toys from every day life items)

- Need to scratch in a manner that they like (vertical/horizontal, types of surfaces)

- Need to be educated in a way that is functional and effective (you can not punish a cat, you can not excessively restrict them over the littlest things, you both live in the same house, your cat can not be allowed to sit on 10% of what you are allowed to sit on for example)

- Need for security (respecting their alone time, respecting them hissing if they need to, respecting when they hide...)

- Need for stimulation and novelty (if your cat never has new experiences for any kind, think of how boring every day must feel like? new stimulations can be sight, smell, touch, eating new things etc)

Personally before I got my kitten I spent about two months reading daily from several serious sources. **Not from asking other equally clueless owners**, from cat behaviour experts, vet sourced articles and so on. 

Assume that people you know who own cats are ignorant of how to take care of them and that their opinion is not valuable. If you haven't had a cat and haven't learned about them, also assume that you are ignorant about them, and that you need to start learning from the ground up (I did assume that about myself).

Here is a list of links that I learned almost everything from:

- https://icatcare.org/advice/?per_page=12

- https://indoorpet.osu.edu/cats

- https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/p/all-about-cats.html

- http://foodpuzzlesforcats.com/

- https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatDaddy66/videos

I would recommend any person who wants to adopt a cat in the near future to read all of those websites many times over until you not only understand the ideas, but are capable of explaining them to someone else.

edit with my boy: https://imgur.com/a/ED5B4ihThis has worked with the two 2 cats that I have taken care of in the past, and now my own 4 months old kitten.

You can hide around the couch and put up obstacles with pillows and such, or hide in another room where the cat will have to run up to you.

It's like playing with a wand toy except you're the prey that gets chased. With the 3 cats that I've played this with they understand on their own that they can't use claws on you. My kitten gently taps with his paw once he runs up to me, but never clawing like with his other toys.

They really all figured out the ""rules"" on their own without any particular training. They know to wait until I hide and then I kinda peek and hide again until I see that they're ready to attack. Then repeat.

I think it's a great bonding activity and the cats seem to really like itI struggle to survive every time someone sneezes in a large area around my point of general existence, trying to protect my vital organs from the shock waves with a leaf's skeleton.

This is a constant fight for survival for me and now that these fatcats experience wind for the first time they can't stop making a big deal out of it"

GF always gives in to the whims of her nephew.  Car broke down, she gives him $1500 to get it fixed.  He pays $450 a month to live with us and does not lift a finger to clean up the house, mow the grass, do his own dishes, etc.  GF and I (47M) do all the work around the house while both work full time.  Nephew also works full time but only pays GF back the minimum credit card payment.  He's got a $2000 tax lien against him for some crypto investment gone sideways but insists on going to strip clubs weekly.

I digress.

Nephew's brother graduates HS Saturday and GF and I were getting a hotel room.  Nephew asks GF if he can stay with us in our room because he doesn't want to stay at his parents house.  GF says yes without consulting me first, so I tell her I'm going to sit this one out.  I've never met this sister but it's a toxic scene that I didn't really want to be a part of in the first place, but GF and I would have had a trip together out of town so that would have been nice.  But nephew crashes that idea.  I'm angry I wasn't consulted about it on a trip I was lukewarm to the idea of going in the first place.

AITA for canceling my going on this trip because GFs nephew crashed the plan at the last minute and I wasn't consulted?

***Update***

We've talked a bit and we're going to have a conversation when she returns.  For those who suggested I leave her, not going to happen without first exhausting every discussion and scenario.  She is the love of my life and I am hers.  Boundaries will be discussed.  She loves her nieces and nephews very much, and as she is not able to have children of her own, she sees herself and a proxy mom to them and her sisters have gone along with this.  I wholly understand that and it's one of the reasons I love her, however I have boundaries and limits and those will be discussedI was reading about KDB on another thread and there are so many post saying that since he's never won UCL or WC he can't be considered one of the best Midfielders of all time.  Or that since Erling Haaland hasn't won UCL or WC he can't be considered the best in the world.

It has been over 25 days since I pulled more than 5k from the daily.   We are running out of coins to supply the team and cannot get the necassary gold and silver tokens required for the playoff team objective.  

Inflation has spread throughout the landscape so our supply lines in solo content have been choked off so we cannot advance.  

We have good men on this team.  92 NAT Deion Jones, 93 legend Herschel Walker, and T4 Landon Collins; but because of their NAT Status and inflation they are unable to make the sacrifice to the Auction House needed to advance.

This may be my last entry. 

My will is breaking...


****Edit:  91 Legend Charles Haley has sacrificed himself to the AH, the crazy son of a bitch.  But the team was able to advance and get the 4 tokens.  After we took the set and seized the moment, we won the day.   New men have joined the team to continue the fight and struggle against that bastard H2H.   

We have reached AM1 and we are scared, but god willing we can overcome what we have experienced on this journey and battle on to WL.

Background: Grew up playing sports, began rowing my freshman year of high school, ended up having a pretty successful high school career, walked on to a d1 team and rowed for a year and a half there before calling it a career in February 2020. Always been interested in lifting and had ran some 5/3/1 stuff during the summer for rowing. Came back to 5/3/1 for about a cycle and a half before covid happened. Once gyms opened back up, I ran 4 weeks of the linear progression version of AtS before hopping on Starscream.

The Program: Starscream([found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VgurR31EhPvREaeWyiGy2Hra-V0xWpWA-UcAhgUS3H8/edit?usp=sharing)) is a hypertrophy program by /u/BenchPauper that incorporates at 5 day ULULU split. Most days are set up pretty similar with working up to a top set of Bench, Incline Bench, Deadlift or squat, followed by backoff volume supersetted with either a pulling movement or abs. Day 5 is a volume day on bench which skips the top set. The rest of the program is metric shit tons of volume. If you like bodybuilding style training and chasing a pump, you will definitely enjoy this program.

My goal going into starscream was to put some muscle mass on and give myself a good base going into a more strength focused program. I can definitely say this program did a great job of accomplishing that. In particular, my back, shoulders and hamstrings saw pretty massive growth. Additionally, I hit some pretty nice pr's without doing much in the way of periodization or peaking at all. 

Things I liked: 

* Squat Days: These were absolutely brutal is the most fun way possible. While I never want do 5\*20 giant sets ever again, they were definetly a fun way to get hypertrophy work in and the pump was always insane
* Pulling Volume: My back saw some awesome growth on this program, which I imagine had something to do with the high volume of sets of pulling work. Every upper day consisted of at least three sets of a horizontal pull and three sets of a vertical pull, often times four or five sets.
* Variety/Flexibility: The nice thing about hypertrophy programs like this is they can pretty much be adjusted to any exercises you want. I was constantly swapping out row variations, swapped back extensions for reverse hypers, did board press instead of Close grip, etc. Workouts rarely got boring as I would often adjust workouts mid session to include some fun new variation.
* Simplicity: No weird rep schemes, no playing with percentages, just go in and lift and try to go a little heavier than last week maybe. 

Things I disliked:

* Squatting/Deadlifting once a week: Not necessarily a gripe with the program personally, as the intensity of the lower days makes recovery a little more difficult, but I definitely saw much more progress in my bench form vs my deadlift and squat form most likely due to the higher frequency 

Whats Next? Probably gonna move onto some nuckols 28 free programs for a few cycles before possibly peaking for my first powerlifting meet.

TL;DR:

Starscream is an awesome hypertrophy/offseason/basebuilding program and I'd recommend it to anyone getting back into the gym after time off. Moved some big weight, worked hard, saw some growth, hit some prs.Putting together a pretty big youtube playlist of videos, would love some suggestions of what to add. Thanks.Say you had a month to get as fit as possible, how would you do it? No limit on amount of workouts or type of workouts, within reason. I’d imagine some sort of steadystate most days with a combination of lifting or AT work in addition to steady state.Probably a long shot but does anyone have anything from RTS Emerging Strategies?

daymcn,7,3,"In December my 8 year old French bull dog got a diagnoses of hemangiosarcoma with a 2-4 month life expectancy after her splenectomy.  She's been generally well and normal with monthly vet checks with the latest one today. She's on gabapentin and cerebral for nausea. The last 14 days she has started to decline and her blood work showed her counts are down. Her vet doesn't think she needs euthanasia just yet as she's still having more good times then bad and recommended to do weekly blood checks and monitor. 

Now my question is more what to expect. I've never euthanized an ill pet, only ones that had traumatic injuries where it was obvious it was the humane choice to do so so feel loss at what to do that's best. I have spoke to her regular vet and the specialist that did her surgery,  as well as various other pet.owners that have experienced similar choices so I am just looking for more perspectives from others. I'm going to miss my little friend terribly and want to do what is best for her and make her end of life easier.

Edit. Thank you everyone for all the advice and help. I guess i should have included, what to expect with the progression with the cancer. How will the changes manifest and what are signs to look for. Is it very painful cancer. Will visible tumors pop up? Her vet said that she could bleed out internally if her new tumor ruptures, there is also a possibility that she will have a hear attack from a rumor growing in her heart. What is the range you usually see for life expectancy, from what I have read, 1-4 months is the usual range with just surgery, so we r getting to the end of that range.[removed]"

It's awful, it's only tangentially related to the context of the post I'm making right now:

In the comments, in reaction to hearing that she was essentially approached and arrested for doing the stoplight dance, a user posts

Pretty straightforward ""college liberal"" bullshit, but let's look at the OP's posting history:  It's nothing but that thread, three month old account

>She literally went on about women's rights for the next hour before I finally decided to walk out. She got furious when I told her I didn't want to be a benevolent sexist by covering her tab.

(697|129)

So I'm wondering three things right now.  Why did she go out on a date with him, why did he ask her out, and why did he stick around when she apparently went on a one-hour tirade about women's rights.

This, is, of course, silly, because it's obvious that he sat through the dinner so that he could burn her with the logic bomb of not paying for the meal, at which point the restaurant erupted into applause, the waitress immediately fell in love with him, and the chalk turned into an eagle named albert einstein


>The problem is, until all these hypocritical ""womyn""(as she called them) are ready to give up ""benevolent sexism benefits"" such as free meals during dates, no one will take them seriously when they want to be treated as if they were male.

Ah Womyn with a Y, a word I never see used by anyone but radical lesbian separatists, but somehow this dude managed to go on a date with one.

>A lot of the special interest groups in America have started this ""I'm a victim"" campaign and look for anything to get upset over just so they can show how terrible their oppressed world is.

Ah, here we go, right into the ""oppression olympics"" MRA talking points

>There are some wack jobs out there as I found that think that any man who masturbates is naturally a rapist and that all PIV(penis in vagina) sex only exists to demean women.

>The same group who say that those who think it should be a ""equal rights"" movement for all sexs, not just women are the ""patriarchy"" trying to make it about men again, because if it was equal rights for all sexes, women naturally get left out

""Patriarchy"" in scare quotes and the mininterpretation of radical fringe feminists that have been dead for a decade presented as some kind of sizable faction within feminism

I'm just gonna hammer these next ones out

>Modern feminism believes that men who do nice things for women because they are women are somehow using it to establish their dominance over them

""modern feminism""

>You have been banned from SRS as a traitor. That is all.

As a bonus, when someone calls him out he goes into professor thesaurus mode

>Are you happy? Of course not. The whole meme rubs you the wrong way and no matter what I say you will debate and come at it with any angle that shines it in a light that suits your means.

>The concept that there can be a hypocritical woman out there capable of such jackassery goes against everything you believe in and causes you what is called cognitive dissonance. Mentally, you have to alleviate this dissonance, and the easiest way is to some how make it not true or prove it false, that way you can continue to live in your little bubble of how you see things without your doubts getting in the way.

>Other prime examples of cognitive dissonance are people who smoke cigarettes. They know smoking is bad for them, but they do it anyway. This causes dissonance. So they will alleviate the dissonance by having thoughts like ""My aunt smoked till she was 81 and never had an issue"" or ""I'd rather die young anyway, the later years are the worst.""



I mean I suppose that it's possible that a dude who believes that feminism is detrimental to society and a militant lesbian somehow ended up on a dinner date, but that's not where my money is.

Zouden,9,7,"I love my Z3, but one thing that has bugged me ever since upgrading from my Nexus 4 is that I can't actually see more content on screen. Even though the 5.2"" screen is clearly bigger than the 4.7"" screen, I have the same number of conversations visible in Whatsapp (8) or Telegram (7) and can read the same amount of text on reddit. I'm not really benefiting from the bigger screen if everything has just been scaled up. I saw the same thing when I compared my Z3 with a friend's Z3c - we can both see the same amount of content. Kinda defeats the purpose of getting the bigger phone!

Well, TIL that you can change the screen density **without root** with a simple adb command:

    adb shell wm density 424

After rebooting the interface will be rescaled. Smaller numbers make things smaller. At first I tried 320 ppi, since that was what the N4/Z3c uses, but everything was *tiny*. After a bit of experimenting I discovered 424 ppi is perfect - everything is the same size as other Android phones. Why 424? Because that's the actual PPI of the screen. [The default value used by Sony on the Z2 and Z3 is 480 ppi](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2755281), so things are unnaturally large. After setting my phone to use the ""native"" ppi of the screen it looks so much better. The same is probably true of many other phones with 5""+ screens.

ProfessorStein,7,6,"This has unfortunately become a regular occurence. Something in my apartment breaks, they come in, say it isn't really broken, tell me they're done looking at it, and close the ticket out. In this instance I'm being told, to my face that a dishwasher is ""Not for cleaning dishes, it's only for disinfecting them"" - Which, sure. It does do that. But the issue is actually that it's not doing either of those things. The thing is old, shitty, and is leaving a slime of soap all over my disshes. It's doing the exact opposite of cleaning stuff. This is what they do every time something is messed up. Maliciously tell me it's essentially user error like I'm a dumb child who can't operate an appliance.

 Last time it was that one of my heaters broke, and they had to be told three times ""no, it is not that I'm not letting it warm up- It blows cold air"" and i had to keep calling every day. Turned out, yes, the unit had broken and had to be entirely replaced. 

It's getting to be a chore, and they're stonewalling and saying under no circumstance will they replace it. It doesn't work for really... Anything. And I swear to fucking god to you I know how to work a dishwasher, because I've owned one in some form for like twenty years and this is a new problem. 

But the point is: Who do I actually call? I don't think I can withhold rent in WA, but who do I actually report my LL to for refusing to follow tenant laws about repairing broken apartment fixtures. Is there an office or something, or do I just call the state AG's office or whatever?I was somewhat recently at a big convention where the FGO team did a big panel talking about upcoming content and other such things. The recent changes happening with NA (bumping our clairvoyance down, essentially) are very intentional and we were directly asked to give live feedback and suggestions, many of which are now being implemented into the game. 

&#x200B;

These panels are usually very 'read between the lines' but this one was incredibly blunt. I've been to a bunch of these over the years and this one had a lot of 'very fed up' energy. First major point I want to make is that NA is very, very sick of JP players that act out on Twitter and on other social media outlets. Descriptions of their behavior were much more honest and to the point rather than implied behaviors. We were directly told that members of Aniplex staff had received death threats over NA getting unique content, especially the Chaldea Breakroom content caused JP players to go absolutely ape and start sending them threats or disgusting, often racist, messages. This seems to have hit a boiling point and actually gotten some people in charge to realize ""We need to stop encouraging or tolerating these people"" and it was stressed to us that NA will be getting more exclusive content, not less. 

EDIT Next Day: I was asked by the mod team to cross through the comments about JP players. I don't use crossthrough because as someone with a visual disability, it's visually obnoxious. But I am willing to put this edit here saying this part is disputed by some people. Here is a link to /u/SpaghettiProgrammer confirming my story/content [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/uukm1s/comment/i9g3cqi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Here is a comment by /u/Rednal that disagrees. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/uukm1s/giving_some_context_on_recent_na_policy_changes/i9g5hjl)

Ultimately I stand by my statements as true, but you have to make your own call.

&#x200B;

Second point: We were told directly, NA story progression is dogshit. It's really bad. An enormous amount of people have not started part 2; It was made clear that this isn't a financial issue, NA still makes absolute bank, enough that it's gotten more team members, not less. But they need to, and want to get more people through the story. They directly asked us to speak on what would make us progress, what we felt caused people not to progress, etc. Many people spoke about the desire to not be AP-Gated and that it's really bad to get to a cliffhanger and then be out of AP. The team suggested fixes for this would almost certainly be coming in the form of maybe more golden fruit being given out, custom Master Missions being used as an example of how those might be given out. More aggressive reductions of AP cost for story, as well. 

&#x200B;

Biggest thing was, generally speaking, NA has a lot more levers to pull right now. The overall implication of this was that with DelightWorks exiting the project the 'status quo' of ""NA follows the JP schedule as closely as possible"" is not going to neccesarily be a thing. They DID tell us that overall release dates for Story and Events is locked, they will not ever accelerate that. But reward structures, custom content/campaigns/missions are on the table for change. The biggest feeling I got watching it was ""Fuck JP, if their userbase is going to act badly, we might as well make shit happen instead of sitting on it."" 

&#x200B;

The talk was, overall, very positive. It was a breath of fresh air, really. It was very clear to most people I spoke to in the room that this was a clear change of policy/approach to NA as a whole, and a much more empowered NA team. I hope this might shed some light on recent decisions, because as someone who had been watching since the event and seeing these changes slowly come into vision, it's 100% in line with what was said at the event. They know things need to change and are finally being given a little bit of space to make those changes, or at least argue for them to be made.

Edit: as mods have said, you should always be wary of claims on the Internet. I am relwying my personal experience and interpretation, nothing more. I definitely do not speak for the NA team or intend to do so. I can tell you I'm genuine all day long, but it's up to you to make an informed decision on if you believe it or not. But ultimately it's just a post about a silly phone game we all enjoy.

I'm going to sleep now, happy farming!I recently commented on Kenji's video about selling the KAN knives for charity. I'm disabled and honestly, poor as shit. I can't afford 700$ for knives, as much as I truly love cooking, and trust me, It's one of my biggest passions now. I wanted to know if I could buy a copy of his book The Food Lab signed, individually- It turned out no... But then Barney Lund, of KAN Knives told me to email him. I did, and together with a third party (who is equally awesome, but i don't wanna name him without permission) they sent me two things in the mail. Free- A copy of The Food Lab, signed by Kenji, and an 8 inch KAN chef knife. 

I'm blown away by not only the generosity, but the compassion and outreach to the community here. All three of these men deserve nothing but praise. I am genuinely in shock still, and I will cherish these items forever. [The Knife](https://i.imgur.com/Lc5Ok89.jpg) and [The Book](https://imgur.com/a/X0pKeph)I just finished the show, and full disclosure- I think the message it sends isn't just bad, it's like actually fucking gross and disgusting. I don't know if the showrunner or writers are just like nuts, or what, but this show's concept of consent is absolutely batshit crazy and delusional. 

The alien collective consciousness gives you a few 'choices' when you meet it: You can deny the test, and be sent back to earth like Becca was, clearly horrified, or you can take this test and have your entire race, no matter how big or small 'judged' against some arbitary metric and you're not allowed to know any of the details of the test. First off, that's fucked- That's stacking the deck against the race you're interviewing to begin with, but that isn't even like the biggest problem. Oh no, that's the fact that the aliens trap you in an unwinnable scenario that the narrative paints as a good thing. 

First off, the first person to reach them decides the fate of the race in almost all cases: The person choosing whether or not to take the test is the only being who consents to this. What about the members of a race who have no fucking idea what's going on? The alien essentially going 'Hey, since you accepted the test we either ascend all of you or exterminate you, have fun'. How is that in any way better than the 'lower' races? It's just a gussied up 'Do what we say and believe what we do or die'. 

So you succeed: You pass the test, your race ascends. The only person we saw resist this was someone who knew it could be coming, Madi. There's no evidence that you can stop it if you don't know it's coming. Essentially force ascending an entire race would be bad enough, but what comes after that is actually like way, way worse than that. Because if you ascend, often likely without proper context or knowledge of what that means, you're now presented with two options: You can lose your individuality and remain as part of a collective consciousness, or you can go back to being human. Cool, right? The benevolent alien gods gave you free will! ... Oops, no- If you choose to throw off their supposed divine emanance/ascension gift, you are rendered permanently sterilized. There's no way to sugarcoat this: That's basically rebranded eugenics. Let's put it in a slightly different set of words, shall we? ""Join the ascended super race, or be forbidden from participating in the gene pool"" Sound good now? Now it sounds a whole lot like something that we've basically been saying for 80 years is an unforgivable crime. 

So you can be ascended without ever knowing, possibly against your will, or you can be baited (without knowledge that you can de-ascend but sterilized) into consent. None of that is consent. What's disgusting is that the narrative paints these guys as the good guys, when in fact they're basically intergalactic species erasers who sell one member of your race a bill of goods, then if they decide they like you, they force-absorb most or all of your race and then sterilize the ones who decide they'd rather not be a part of the whole 'cleansing the universe of races we decide are savages' thing. They aren't good guys, they're the biggest antagonists a sci-fi show could possibly have. It's like the Ori from Stargate, but written by idiots. 

This was definitely a rant, but the whole thing made me wretch after I watched it. What the fuck kind of writers room basically writes a eugenicists wet dream as a finale?

Edit: A lot of people are  unintentionally or intentionally misrepresenting what I'm saying here. I'm not gonna dedicate another four paragraphs telling you this, butt: The space alien gods being eugenicists isn't actually the problem necessarily. antagonists can do bad shit and should do bad shit. This isn't that. this is the show writers telling you that the eugenicist were right, actually. 

 please god go take a writing course. you don't present the overwhelming space diety that is essentially enlightened centrist eugenicists as being right or worthy of cowling to. **it's okay for antagonists to be evil. it isn't okay for the narrative to say ""actually, eradicating the human race is correct and fun, the end""**. you don't give narrative validity to the idea that consent can be gained via duplicitous means. it's okay if the aliens are obviously evil and you're paying it off by having them go away. then their lack of consent is a narrative device presented negatively towards a goal of saying that consent is important. This is the basis of fantasy. Bad guys don't care about consent, but the show theme shouldn't be that they're right or get away with consent not matteringThis is actually a sort of long term story, but it leads into today and the future. I haven't told anyone this story, even my doctors but it's driving me crazy and I feel like I have to say something. About a year ago I was laying in bed just minding my business when I gently rake my finger over my closedv eye. now I'm really tired and not thinking straight, I see a little bit of spark across my eye. Just like this tiny little bright spark. I was curious, so I did it about 4 more times. After that I stopped. Everything seemed fine and nothing really changed immediately. Over the next couple of weeks my vision started to distort. Slowly but surely letters started to havev an after image of themselves, like in my bad eye. Then things started to get blurry and kept getting blurry and then they kept getting even more blurry. Over the course of several weeks I completely lost vision in the eye. Smeared colors and blur. After seeing many doctors it turns out that I have a severe cataract and need surgery. Normally the surgery is very simple- unfortunately for me it is not quite as simple as I have a thing called Marfan syndrome, meaning the little links that keep your lens in place are weak, and surgery will break them. Meaning that while for a regular patient they just insert a fake lens, I have to wait until my eye heals and then try an external lens. If that doesn't work they'll have to literally sew a new lens inside my eye. My doctor is also far away and it's turning out to be really expensive to get to appointments, which is generally bad news for the blind guy who only gets disability. Go me.

All because I'm stupid. You may now laugh.I noticed during the tag match especially he was standing so far away from his partners, at one point halfway down the apron from them. He also was yelling really aggressively for tags and actually frowned and clenched the ropes really hard when bubba and d-von were tagging in each other rather instead of him.

constantvariables,5,1,"With so many highlights from last night, I think this is getting overlooked a bit.  It was great to see the guy(honestly can't tell which one) think so fast and get himself up there for the move.  My mind couldn't even finish thinking ""Shit, they just fucked up a big spot"" before he was right in there to cover his partners ass.  If someone has a gif that'd be great.

So to either Diego or Fernando, mad props.  And to either Diego or Fernando, don't be so jittery up on the turnbuckle.In the first X-men, Magneto's evil plan is to turn the world's elite into mutants using a machine that harnesses his powers and emits radiation that triggers mutation in normal humans.  But this mutation is unnatural and rejected by the body.  The cells break down and the recently mutated turn to goop.  At least that's what happened to the only  normal human exposed to it, Senator Kelly.  

Once Kelly makes it to the Xavier Institute, Charles reads his mind and Jean examines him.  They then explain what's happening with the Senator.  When Cyclops asks what effect the radiation had on mutants, Charles responds ""There *appears* to be none"".  I don't believe this and I don't even know what Charles based that answer off of.  I think it's just the fact that The Brotherhood was also exposed and didn't die.  But Jean explains the radiation triggers an unnatural mutation in normal people.  Of course it wouldn't *appear* to have an effect on people who have already had that mutation triggered naturally.  What I do think is that the radiation enhanced those mutations.

Let's start with Magneto.  The machine is drawing power from him, so I don't think he was included in having his powers increased.  He's drained too quickly for the outputting radiation to effect him.  Even the second time, Rogue is filtering his power into the machine.

When Mystique revealed herself to the Senator on his helicopter, she didn't knock him out in one kick.  It took several and that's just a normal human.  Later in the movie, after being exposed to the radiation, she's able to go toe-to-toe with a powerful mutant like Wolverine.  She only loses because she didn't expect Logan to smell the difference between her and Storm.  Logan stabs her in the stomach and leaves her for dead.  She survives once Magneto beings emitting the radiation.  Once it hits her, it increases her natural healing ability and she's able to recover from her wounds.  I don't think she was playing possum because she doesn't respond to Magneto when he tries to radio her a bit later.

Toad is a tough case.  Before he's exposed, the only thing we're shown of his power is him using his tongue to nab and eat a bird, so we don't know much about his powers pre-radiation.  At the the train station, he's shown shooting his tongue farther and near the end, he successfully separates the top three X-men from each other.  I doubt he was that strong before his exposure.

We weren't shown much of Sabretooth pre-exposure either.  He kicked Logan's ass and showed that he was kind of dumb.  That's about it.  After the exposure, he still kicked Logan's ass on top of the Statue of Liberty and was only ""killed"" due to his own stupidity.  

All Storm did in the first movie is summon lightning and utilize gusts of wind, and even those seem to require concentration.  In X2, she's capable of forming multiple funnel clouds while flying a jet.

Cyclops' uncontrolled power blasts through the train station roof in the first movie.  In X2, his ""controlled"" power is capable of destroying an entire dam.

Wolverine was knocked unconscious by Sabretooth and required rescue from the X-men.  It's tough to say how long Logan was knocked out, but Rogue had already started attending classes by the time he woke up so it had to have been considerable.  In X2 he's shot straight in the head and able to recover in a minute or two.  

Rogue actively avoids using her powers so it's tough to say how she was effected.  In X2, she absorbs and uses Pyro's power much quicker than she did Logan's in the first movie.  

When Toad charges Jean, she uses her power to freeze him in mid-air but she did not control his bodily functions.  He was able to spit a slimeball at her and escape.  In X2, Jean is capable of freezing Nightcrawler in mid-air AND preventing him from using his teleportation power.  The most important idea of this theory is that the radiation Jean was exposed to was the first step in the Phoenix being unleashed.  Her powers grew exponentially between the two movies.  I believe she was aware of this increase in power and thought she'd be able to stall the dam flood long enough for the jet to take off.  She couldn't do it on her own so she recognized the Phoenix and was able to control it just long enough to get her friends to safety.  After that, Jean was lost and the Phoenix was in total control.

Let me know what you think.Brock didn't try to crawl or even reach to the ropes.  He didn't struggle and try to overpower Cena.  He simply reversed it when he wanted to.  Maybe it was obvious to most people but he sold the pain well and it just stuck out to me that he seemed to flip Cena over with ease and start pounding on him before the F5.  It's almost like he let Cena pull out his tricks then decided to put him down.  Just made me appreciate the ending that much more.Anytime jokes are made at this guy's expense and people ask what his deal his, the question isn't answered.  Is he a shitty wrestler?

spiritcrusher77,8,2,"So, let me give some background. From a young age, I was a slave on the desert planet, known as Tatooine. And let me tell you, there was sand *everywhere*. It got in my eyes at times, during sandstorms, I was cut and bruised just by all of that coarse, gritty sand. Really, it was all there was in sight, and I really just could not get away from the stuff fast enough. I've been avoiding places with a lot of sand, since then, and it's really strained some family relationships. I'm considering going back to see my mother, if she's even still alive, just to rescue her from those cruel people down there.

Now, my girlfriend, on the other hand (I'm not sure if we're really  ""official"" yet, but we're basically a thing), she actually seems to have sort of an affinity for the stuff. She told me that she loved swimming to this one island with all of her school friends when she was younger, and then just lying there, on that disgusting, coarse, gritty sand until the sun dried them out. I really don't know what she sees in sand, honestly. I mean, how can you like something so, so coarse? So rough? So irritating? Not to mention, it gets *everywhere*, as I've mentioned before.

I really don't want this to become a strain on our relationship. At the same time, I just can't stand sand. It's so awful, not to mention all the savages that live *in* the sand, particularly on Tatooine. Maybe I'm wrong about sand, maybe I'm being unfair to it. I was wondering if someone could give me a different perspective on sand.Liam Neeson's character in Taken, specifically (Bryan Mills). The world that this takes place in contains John Wick's network of assassins. They're unable to work with anyone besides the characters from their own universes, or each other. 

**Round 1:** Wick and Mills are unaware of each other at the start. They know nothing about who kidnapped the daughter and dog, and must use their individual skills to discover who did.

**Round 2:** Wick and Mills know each other from the very beginning, but they still don't know who perpetrated the kidnapping. Combining their resources from the start, who can they take down?

**Round 3:** Not only do they know each other from the very beginning, they also have detailed knowledge of who kidnapped Mills' daughter and Wick's dog.

**Bonus Round:** Rather than the characters, the actual actors Liam Neeson and Keanu Reeves are put in this situation. If bloodlusted, who is the strongest character they can take down?I've been watching the convention livestream, and the second ballot has ended, with Gary Johnson taking the nomination. The vice presidential nominee will be selected sometime around 2:05 EST, which means that there's a chance of Bill Weld not being his VP. What does this mean for the general? Does he have a shot in November? Is it likely that he'll be on the debate stage this year? Lastly, how do you think his opponents will take this?

**EDIT:** Regarding the VP nomination, it's now going to a second ballot. The first ballot had Bill Weld at 49%, and for the second ballot, Alicia Dearn will be dropped. Additionally, Will Coley dropping out, and endorsing Larry Sharpe for VP, who attained around 30% of the vote.

**EDIT 2:** Well, it's official, Weld is the libertarian nominee for Vice President."

br0hemian,8,10,"I had no idea what a guided game was until about a week after Season 2 dropped, because up until that point I never had any trouble finding people to run Nightfall.  But after the mass exodus of guardians that was Curse of Osiris, I am one of the only people in my group of friends who is still playing D2, so I have been doing guided games since then.  Today I came home from a particularly long day of work and smiled to myself when I realised it was weekly reset.  I went to que up for a nightfall to find out that I am out of tickets.  Confused but not yet angry, I turn to my good friend Google to find out how to get more nightfall tickets... but there isn't an immediate, clear answer.  After mining through 15 minutes worth of salty forum posts I finally accept what feels like a surreal answer to my question... there is actually no way to get more tickets.  I am expected to wait until the end of the *season* to be able to que for nightfall games again.

Is this a fucking joke?  Seriously, what is the intention behind this?  I have been sitting on this for a few minutes now and I still have not been able to think of one tangible reason as to why they would design it in this way.

I have every piece of Exotic armor for every class, I have every Exotic weapon, I have three 335 characters with a set of armour specific for each subclass.  I have quite literally no incentive left to play Destiny 2.  *Nothing* left to unlock, *nothing* new left to experience.  ***AND I STILL PLAY BECAUSE THIS GAME IS FUN***.

No, I'm standing in the middle of the line to let this beer warm up and this sausage thaw. BACK UP!There's an increase of talk about people feeling more anxious about everything as this drags out. How is everyone? 

Personally, I'm hanging in there and feeling mostly positive. Definitely bored and feeling isolated at times. Concerned for my mom, who lives in New Jersey, and my grandpa, who's in hospice in Kansas. Overall, though, I think we'll get through this. There will be deaths. I think the economy, nationally and locally, is going to take a severe hit and I feel for small business owners and workers impacted by the shutdowns. But I feel safe here in Houston and feel like we'll fare better than other cities. It's not going to be good, but it's going to be alright in the long run.Just got done - 943/1000

Took it online. No issues whatsoever

The method: First off, I've been employed in technical roles for most of my life. I'm also a tech hobbyist. So I'd say my background helped. The only things I really felt shaky on were some of the finer details of things like OSPF, STP, EtherChannels, etc. Understood the concepts, it was tough remembering all the configuration details and interactions. 

Studied for the last month and a half using the OCG. I initially just read through the two volumes. Then I did a speed read through, highlighting and annotating the finer details of some things. For the last week and a half, I've been taking the Boson practice tests, and reviewing my notes. I didn't do any labbing. My personal take on labbing: if you're new to this, do it. If you have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to networking, don't worry about it.

The experience: My questions were all over the place. I'd say most the important skill to have is to know your subnetting. If you can figure out the networks, you can figure everything else out quickly (usable range, first usable, last usable, broadcast). Next, understand the outputs from various show commands. Definitely know your concepts: how things work, the processes used, why certain actions are taken. Finally, know all the topics. I can't think of any topic in the OCG guide that I didn't encounter in one way or another.

As I wrote earlier, for me, I just worry about the network ID's. As long I know the network I'm working on, the previous network, and the next network, everything else falls into place for me. YMMV.I had a drunk moment last night and broke my apartment key. Not wanting to pay the complex $25 for another (my spare is with my SO who lives in another part of the city), I started looking for options to replace the key. 

Lowes has a self-service machine but it requires you to place the key into a slot, similar to a keyhole. I didn't want to risk the key getting stuck so I tried Home Depot. Their machine requires an employee to operate. The key is laid flat and the machine does a laser scan and then cuts a blank. It worked perfectly and cost me a whopping $2.62.

I'd imagine the caveats are that it needs to be a clean break and that the key needs to be able to lay flat. I'm 45. I've worked in telecom for the last 15 years or so. I've gotten into various companies doing business sales, premise technician, and technical support. Through some of my career, I've had a few purely technical roles but most were project management and management. Between jobs, I always struggled to get away from customer service. Even though I have the technical chops and aptitude, I didn't have the roles or education on my resume.

I went and got my AA in Computer Science from a community college a couple of years ago. It still didn't seem to help much. This year, I obtained my A+ and CCNA certs. I accepted that I'd probably have to start at the bottom as a help desk or entry-level network technician and accepted that. I'm not a person afraid of working hard to prove myself. That Help Desk job never found me. Instead, I've accepted an engineer role at a FANG, today.

If you really want to be an IT because you have a passion for it, and not just because it pays good, then make a plan, stick with it, and stay open to any opportunity that will help you build your technical employment history. Shoot for the stars but also be open to having to work your way up from the bottom. Don't let the naysayers here or on any forum deter you."

Probably really easy, but I'm trying avoid making too many trips back/forth from home depot!

I'd like to hang a tv aerial from my balcony from the beams supporting the floor of the deck of the apartment above me.

The easiest thing would be to use a couple of screw hooks and hang it parallel to the beams, however the actual transmitter is at a 30-45 degree angle so ideally I'd like to be able to rotate it somehow.

What would be easiest way to achieve that? Photos show it currently suspended from a nail that was already up there as a clue.

Two eye hooks and some picture frame wire?

With Chevy's website so proudly showing the 'custom order' feature, is that something that actually exists, or are my dealers just complacent / busy?As per title. A local dealer trying to justify an $8000 ""Market Adjustment"" told me Nissan is only going to make 200 of the 2023 LEAF and that being so rare that's why they 'need'to charge such a markup.

Looking to get our small bathroom refitted in the next couple of months. Not knowing any contractors I went on HomeAdvisor and Yelp, picked a few places that looked good and HOLY HELL...

The bathroom is 5x10'. The fixtures we're looking at buying would probably cost about $2,500 for bath, toilet, vanity, basin etc. at Home Depot. All in, I was expecting to do the job for maybe $7,000-8,000 including all labor, permits etc.

The first two companies came out today and both quoted around $30,000 *just for the labor* to do the work.

I get it. This is the bay area. Everything is expensive. But that sounds absolutely insane to me for a simple like-for-like replacement job with very very few ""building supplies"" needed. So even though costs might be up right now, a couple feet of copper or PVC is not going to make a whole lot of difference regardless of what the price is.

In the UK where we're from I could hire a general plumber to do the whole job, solo, and it would take them maybe 2 weeks at a day rate working out to maybe $4,000 total.

At this price, I'd be better off taking a month off work, unpaid, doing it all myself with brand new tools,.and I'd still be massively better off than hiring somebody.

Did I just approach the wrong type of contractor? Am I looking in the wrong place? 

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.Hi folks.

What did you do to get the driver account active without adding a vehicle? My bg check is complete but I still can't do anything without adding a vehicle.

Got the email today - delivery expected for August 9th! That's much earlier than September!!**


*Abbreviated conversation as follows. Hopefully they come in stock much quicker than they expect, but otherwise September is a long way away. The 10% discount takes care of the MIR and tax, which I guess is nice?*


Transcript start:

**Amazon**:Hello, my name is Amazon. I'm here to help you today.


**Me**:hi there. i'm getting in touch about the above order
i placed it 9 days ago and still haven't heard anything


**Amazon**:Okay, I understand your problem, i am sorry for the inconvenience caused .
Please allow me a moment.


**Me**:of course, thanks.


**Amazon**: EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB SC GAMING, only 6.8 in, Perfect for mITX Build Graphics Card 06G-P4-6163-KR this is the order you are talking about right?\


**Me**:that's correct


**Amazon**: I am sorry to keep you waiting.

I can understand that this order has not been fulfilled so far. I have checked and can see that we have not received the quantity of the item from the supplier what we expected and due to this most of the orders has not fulfilled. I do understand that you have ordered it for a purpose. 

I'd like to inform you that we process the order on first cum first serve basis and many customer place their orders in a fractions of seconds. **[Btw - lol @ 'first cum first serve']**

I have checked that this item isn't available right now and on checking I have found that we are expecting to get more stock for it in September' 2016. I can see that you have ordered this item at a very good price and that is why amazon has not canceled this order because we personally want you to get this item at the best price.


**Me**:SEPTEMBER?!?!?!


**Amazon**:In this case, you can wait for this order to be shipped and to make up for the inconvenience caused to you due to delay,. I can leave a note in your account for 10% refund on this order once it ships out.


**Me**:that's..... that's a really really long time!

i guess i should stop checking my emails every few hours then huh!


**Amazon**:I do understand that. If I was at your place I would feel in the same way. But I hope you can understand that availability issue. We are trying hard with the supplier to get more stock sooner.

I assure you that we will email you once we have more stock of it and a delivery date.

Do you mind waiting for this order and accept 10% discount?


**Me**:yes. i think i'll just have to be patient

thank you for the offer

hopefully the supplier will deliver sooner than expected
Hi folks.

I live in San Jose, CA, in a house with split floor plan where some is on slab, and some is over a small (500sqft and not high) crawl space. Most of the information online regarding crawl spaces seems to be focused on the east coast where the humidity is much more of a problem.

Here, the ground down there is dry, year-round. The woodwork which I believe is original from 1978, is still in great condition with no signs of mold or deterioration.

Our main concern is that the floors above the crawl space are very cold, and I also wonder / worry about pulling up really dusty air from beneath the floor, as while the house is reasonably well sealed, there are definitely holes all around the place for air to ventilate up into the living space.

I've had a couple of companies around to look at the space and give their thoughts.

One company wants to install fiberglass insulation to the floor (with webbing / strapping to hold it in place) as well as a moisture barrier. The other company is saying that the moisture barrier alone will be enough to reduce the heat loss and insulation is not necessary. I'm not 100% sure I understand how that would work (reduced stack effect?) and wonder if the floors would still radiate onto the cold ground below?

In case anybody was curious, both quotes are around the same level, so the company wanting to add insulation is not really upselling me by recommending more than the crawl space alone might cost.

Regardless of which approach I go with, I'd be sealing off equivalent to 4 of the 5 vents, which would comply with the building codes for a covered crawl space floor. I also plan to place foam board against the concrete walls and generally seal up as many other small spots with (canned) spray foam.

My questions are:

1) Given the generally dry environment in my area, is there the same risk that insulation placed to the floors may nevertheless soak up moisture, rot and fall down over time?

2) Is it true that a moisture barrier alone will reduce heat loss through the floor? Does the thickness, or use of a ground pad impact this effectiveness?

Can anybody give any advice?

Thanks!Hey all.

(Kodi is running on a Shield TV, using v0.3.4 of the addon. Jellyfin is running latest stable (10.4.0) within a Docker.)

Usual initial preamble - I think Jellyfin is amazing and the Kodi addon makes for a perfect combination.

I'm having a recurring issue that is driving me crazy and wondered if anyone else has the same issue.

I have multiple music libraries configured in Jellyfin. One of which is a 'Classical Music' library that is pretty poorly tagged and needs a lot of TLC. As a result, I don't want my Kodi clients to see this library because of its size and it makes navigating the rest of my music collection pretty painful.

Seems easy enough - I should be able to individually add libraries on initial configuration and soI have been selecting just my main Music / Compilation Albums libraries, however after a long initial sync, Kodi *still somehow* finds out about the albums, artists etc. from the classical library. In other words the whole library made it over into Kodi even though I explicitly did not select it on first use. It's almost like even though libraries are selected individually in the configuration screen, it syncs 'All' anyway.

I have reset Kodi entirely, reset the database on multiple occasions and even rebuilt my Jellyfin database but it still persists as an issue.

Any thoughts on why this is happening, and how to fix it? Are there any logs that might be useful to see what's going on (when I open them up it's just a long repeating jumble of 'GetItemList' requests but almost nothing else? I don't especially want to have to set up a separate 'Kodi' user and block access, because I'd have complicated stats for the other libraries.

Thanks!"

Do we put all different recycling material in the same bag? Like we have a separate little trash can/recycling bin in our apartment and we just stick soda cans, cereal boxes, magazines, etc, in it?

 I submitted a critical openings request into Passport for the Carolinas and Virginia and was hoping there might be on someone on here who knew a store that needed a full-time produce clerk. 

My assistant produce manager has told me to get specific store numbers and call to speak to those specific store managers. That I reach out to the store, and then the store reaches out to my store manager. 

Thanks for any and all help.

-Stormcloud-,2,10,"I'm making this post in response to the post currently on the front page. Whilst not everyone has to like the same things, and criticism is of course allowed, I wanted to share some of the positive aspects of this amazing series to provide an alternative opinion for prospective new readers. 

Preface: this is all, like, my opinion man. I will try to keep the post spoiler free. So on to the good parts: 

Rand's character arc is the best hero arc in all of fantasy. And because the series is so long the character development feels earned and therefore much more impactful.

The magic system is awesome and has a lot of depth to it, not just in the magic itself but how it has influenced the whole culture of the world. 

The ending is phenomenal and well worth the wait, that's all I'll say. 

The world building is top notch. Seriously the amount of cultures and nations is pretty cool. 

Mat from book 3 onwards is a national treasure (minus a slight blip in book 12) 

All the characters have serious flaws. This might make them annoying to some, but I enjoy the realism. 

And lastly: some of the stuff that happens is just really, really cool! (Dumai well's anyone?) 

Thanks for reading. I know this series isn't anywhere near perfect but I just wanted to highlight some of the good.

Edit to include some of the series I've read for context: Asoiaf, malazan, storm light, kingkiller, Lightbringer, Witcher, the broken earth and Ryria to name a few. And for the record I enjoyed all of these immensely! Stormlight is the series with the best chance to displace WoT as my favourite."

DrOrganicSwagPHD,3,9,"**tl;dr at bottom**

I haven't really seen anyone highlight this, but I think this is a very important takeaway from the league.

Bestiary crafting gave a way for GGG to provide ANY content in the game without limiting it to Zana mods/divination cards. Better yet, this is something you could target farm with a little know-how. 

GGG is trying to add something that isn't just another Breach. Density creep (we have breach, abyss [breach 2.0], and soon a breach 3.0) seems to be all the community really asks for anymore. As much as people bash leagues, I don't really often see the community discuss what they would like to see out of further leagues besides regurgitating ""breACH!!""

It provided tons of cool things such as:

* Flask crafting- remember spending all your alts to try and hit that Chemist's of Heat flask, only to message 10 afk people and end up buying it for 10c?

* Imprinting of blue items - super nice having multiple chances to hit that regal on your dream item

* Remove/Add Prefix Suffix - annul/exalt in one!

* Adding a specific stat to an item while preserving prefixes/suffixes - INSANE crafting potential. It can be argued that this was way too strong and huge power creep, as it allowed for much cheaper crafting of godly items. It did have a downside of potentially bricking your item by locking affixes. You also did have to use red beasts of appropriate ilvls for the craft.

* Mirroring flasks - Perfect QS and jades for everyone! I made a large amount of chaos throughout bhc from mirroring my perfect alchemist's adrenaline quicksilver. It was a neat experience getting to host a ""mirror service"" for once.

* Horizon orbs - easier atlas progression and much less buying/trading needed when chasing red/t15 elder/shaper guardians. Very useful for SSF as well

* Access to talismans - did you know you could farm Pen for tons of canines to use for the t2 talisman recipe? I filled the rest of the recipe with the unique from A6 coast. I sold ~10 talismans I farmed for 50-200c each

* White sockets on non corrupted items!

* Allowing another way to target farm uniques through specific ilvl red beasts

* Aspects and having items that alter how they work (without just giving straight-up set bonuses) were super neat

So yeah, these are all pretty dope imo. I hope some of you feel the same way. If my bias isn't obvious, I LOVED Bestiary. I haven't had this much fun playing the game since....breach.

GGG wanted to provide us with access to all these things to add depth to the game. Instead of saying ""the things bestiary provided are really cool, but the beast system is kinda poopoo"", the community just repeated ""bestiary is shit"" all league.

The system is definitely more complicated than it needs to be: there are too many nets, there's so much information in beast names/genus/mods/etc, mobs have their own special skills (some of which feel really overtuned), some beasts feel worse than map bosses, and more.

Was the system rough around the edges? Most definitely. But what GGG aimed to provide in this league was more than I could have ever asked for

**tl;dr** bestiary was rough around the edges, but it gave GGG a way to provide ANY content in the game without limiting it to Zana mods/divination cards and without continuously adding large packs of mobs to maps."

Now I understand that maybe the companies behind those tournaments are trying to compete with eachother for viewers and what not... But I do think this is super confusing even for someone who watches overwatch esports from day one. 

If you'll look at the streams you'll notice that both tournaments even use almost the same overlays and graphics ( Black with the typical overwatch yellow ) 

First i thought its the same tournament having a chinese stream and a korean stream but then i noticed its two completely different things... And its beyond confusing to have two Asian tournaments going on at the same time that have almost the same name and look almost the same for someone that just checks in.

Not to mention it devides the audience and is pretty unfriendly for new viewers that overwatch tries to reach.

I just installed and upgraded to pro version after using Antenna. I really like it so far but is there a way to make the font size bigger 

Edit: also can YouTube links open the YouTube app ? Is there a way to make this setting? Same goes for websites opening in safari if I want to?Hi ! I have been obese for roughly 18 years and decided it’s time to try and change that. Im a guy roughly 150kg +- 5 kg  and 173 cm.  (35 year old male) Im 12h away from finishing the first fast of my life. I have been only drinking water, and unsweetened tea and coffee since late Sunday night and am coming close to finish my 5 day fast. 

The question I have is this how do I transition from here to a one meal per day every second day routine? 

I’ll reach the 5 day fasting point at midnight today but I won’t eat until tomorrow.

Right now the plan is to eat some bone broth tomorrow around 3 pm and then have a light dinner starting at 6pm. So my eating window tomorrow won’t be longer than 6 hours. 

Does this sound good to you? Or should I eat without being on a time schedule for a day or two to “recover” from the 5 day fast and then transition into OMAD every second day?

Thanks a lot for advice!"

CaptainSharkFin,2,3,"Just a friendly, daily reminder to our brothers and sisters viewing this subreddit.

The common misconception seems to be that in order to be a part of the Master Race, you are required to have a decent gaming PC put together by your own hands. I'm here to inform you that this is completely **false**. Although, yes, it is preferable to build your own PC rather than buying a pre-built, it doesn't really matter when all you want to do is consider yourself part of the PCMR.

All you need, is to know and understand that the PC is the superior platform for gaming. When you have accepted this, then you are a part of the Master Race.I frankly do not want to be relegated to the Recon class just to be able to use an army's Standard-Issue weapon. I believe it would be possible to balance these by not allowing long-range scopes to be fitted onto them if a separate sub-class was created for any class to be able to use them.

I want to be a British Medic using the Lee-Enfield, or a Wehrmacht Support using a Kar98. Please give us this option."

ourlegacy,5,6,"[removed]I'm signing off as a mod. Some of you might have read the modpost I wrote earlier today between me and /u/Jrmio. The situation escalated to a point I don't want to be at, and I don't find it worth my time or my money.

The past few months I haven't been interested in reps, or moderating and I don't see myself enjoying moderating any time soon after this today. I also don't think I should be a moderator of a designer rep sub, if I'm not that interested in reps anymore. So I'm going to spend less time on Reddit and try improve myself over the summer, and maybe check in once in a while and QC some ramones, since y'all never use the search bar for rick ramones. They almost all have the same flaws you guys! Air vent holes should not be horisontal, the toe cap shouldn't bulge too much and the zipper should be diagonal.;)

I love this sub and I love all of the other mods, even Jrmio and his tenacity for making things work.

Thanks for the good times, the great finds and the amazing projects such as Real vs. Rep etc. I'll miss most of it, but fuck the gucci aces man, they're boring as hell.This is a shorter version of the already great image search guide from the wiki and from: https://oneonefriend.wordpress.com/2016/11/27/guide-taobao-searching/

___

###Step 1
Get yourself some stock pictures of the prodcut you want to find. Look at sites like **ssense, the brands own website, farfetch, endclothing, etc.**

[Don't fucking use grailed pics or fitpics.](http://i.imgur.com/Umbk8zq.jpg)

###Step 2
Save the pictures to a folder. Call the folder ""Taobao"" or ""Image search"" to keep them in a single folder.

###Step 3
Go to taobao.

###Step 4
[Upload your picture to the image search function.](http://i.imgur.com/8xrv8ps.png) So click the little camera and select your picture.

###Step 5
[Crop your image](http://i.imgur.com/VJybamK.png) so it fits what you're [looking for](http://i.imgur.com/FTk62mz.png). 

Here's a [bad example of a crop](http://i.imgur.com/OYFS6Od.png) and [a good one](http://i.imgur.com/UwUnj3U.png).

###Step 6
Look at your results! Did you find something? Try crop it a bit better and maybe you'll find something. Else try use a picture from another retailer site. 

###Extra tip
If you're looking for a certain item, but you can't find it with image search, then try some other products from same brand. You might be looking for a rick owens mohair turtle neck, but whenever you image search you just get regular turtle necks. But if you image search some other rick product, then you might find a new store selling more products and perhaps the item you're looking for. Do some digging. It's actually quite fun.


##""But why should I use this OurLegacy?""
Because /r/Designerreps isn't a service where somebody sits ready to find a rep for you. You should do your own research, and to do that, you'll need to know how to do it. 

##""I can't find any camera icon?""
Change your location on taobao to mainland.

##""I didn't find anything! This is shit!""
No it's not. You just used a bad picture, or there's not a rep of it on taobao using the picture. Read the guide in the wiki or at the top of this thread, and see what other ways you can do, to find reps (keywords, translate to chinese etc.).

##""This takes too long! / I don't have the time to search!""
No it fucking doesn't. This takes less than a minute depending on how fast taobaos servers are. If you can't take a minute out of your day to image search for the item, then you shouldn't take a minute out of your day to ask someone else to find it for you. Again: This sub isn't a service where someone is ready to help you. We're all looking for something, just a few of us bother taking the time to do so.
Okay so I spent half of my day today looking for grails of mine and ended up finding a shit ton of different things, that I wasn't really searching for. Disclaimer: There's A LOT of Visvim and I can't vouch for any of the sellers or the products. Most of the sellers has a diamond rating, some have hearts.
###Before someone asks: I used multiple ssense and designer stock photos for taobao image search. You gotta use the images that the sellers use, so fitpics and grailed pics won't work. I also used some translated key words.

There's a lot of threads about taobao sellers but I haven't seen any about WeChat sellers on here. I figured I'd ask who you guys follow/befriended on WeChat and that I'd share my own.

Those of you who have had custom homes built before, what are some “must-haves?” For example, we have Teslas so a must have would be a electric car wiring built in. A nice to have would maybe be a generator (auto switches). Any other ideas?Do you guys think Mr. Clarke got some action that night with the chick after the call with Dustin? Maybe a little HJ at least or just the tip?During the hype of Qubic, I kept hearing from the founders that “Q” would put IOTA in the top 3 market cap. What happened with that?Those who have CHUBB insurance (home, rental, auto, umbrella) is it worth it?

What are your thoughts? I would appreciate some first hand experience.I get the part that you open a traditional IRA and then convert it to a Roth IRA, but what happens when you convert it? Does the traditional IRA account gets closed? What if you have an existing Roth IRA, does it get added to that? Lastly, how often do you convert it? When the balance reaches a certain amount?

This is all with Vanguard of course. Should I have gotten the wifi one instead? I can't wait to use this!Is there any point to funding 529 plans if your state doesn’t have a tax deduction? It seems kind of pointless with disadvantages outweighing advantages (I.e. withdrawing for use not directly for school). 

Wouldn’t most people (in states that don’t have a credit) have more liquidity with their investment in just putting it in VTSAX or something similar? That way it can be used for retirement if your kid doesn’t end up needing it (scholarship or even if they choose not to pursue higher education). Can we talk about some experiences (good or bad) with insurance companies? 

A lot of folks in this subreddit seem to recommend Chubb and I’m trying to understand why and if there *really* is a difference in insurance companies. 

They all make huge amounts of money. But what sets one insurance company apart from another? You likely won’t know until you go and file a claim. Could anyone post experiences, albeit anecdotal, with their insurance company in the past?Anyone know if it's kosher to secure an ether wallet containing ICN with ledger nano S?

Edit: YesHow do I get my 2 year old from hitting me in the face? He thinks it's a game. He swipes at my face and then smiles or laughs. I've tried:

- sternly telling him ""no""
- getting down to his level and saying that it hurts mommy/daddy
- yelling
- redirecting it and have him touch my face instead

All of them work to some degree. I get him to say sorry and he says ""no no."" 

BUT he'll do it again. Later on in the day or the next day. It just seems like all a big game to him or some sort of ritual. He will hit me, I'll discipline him, he says sorry. Rinse and repeat. How do I get him to stop? This gets really embarrassing in public sometimes. "

So, this summer I worked at a big box store in the paint department. Usually I would just be behind the counter mixing peoples colours into their paint for them, but it wasn't a very busy department so more often than not o ended up just roaming the isles looking for customers to help. I'm doing this one day and I see a lady looking lost in the isle beside all the spray paints. I all her what she wants and she says she needs green.
Me: Green what?

Her: spray paint

Me: okay it's right over here

Her: there's so many different kinds, which one do I use?

Me: well what are you looking to do with it?

Her: it's for the trees

Me: (confused, thinking I misunderstood because of her accent) sorry what was that?

Her: I have trees in my yard and they're turning yellow, I need to paint them so they stay green

Me:(WTF?) Umm... Well, this paint is... green... (Shows her a durable outdoor spray paint)

Her: oh okay, how much do I need?

Me: (still trying to figure out what's going on) um..... I've never seen anybody use spray paint to paint a tree before so I don't know how much you need, sorry.

Her: is 3 enough?

Me: I really don't know (she hasn't even told me the size or amount of trees)

Her: 3 is probably enough though right?

Me: uhhh yeah, probably (I don't get paid enough for this)

And then she just took her 3 cans of spray paint and left. I was still in shock. I'll never know what happened when she tried to paint her trees back to life.

I'm really excited to start playing goalie (New to ice hockey in general), and the last step for me to get between the posts would be getting a goalie jock strap.

Unfortunately none of the local hockey shops have goalie cups for sale, so I'm looking to get one online. 

My Questions are:

1. I'm 5'9 140 lbs, would I want to get a junior or senior goalie cup? I would also be mostly playing drop-in hockey at my university and maybe rec leagues over the summer/next year
2. [I was looking at the cups on amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Goalie+cup&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AGoalie+cup), or would I be better off getting one elsewhere (Goaliemonkey?)

hondolor,1,1,"I propose the following variant of the [trolley problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) thought experiment:

there's a trolley hurtling down a track which diverts downhill on two separate tracks A, B.

* On track A a robot is tied, with human semblance and who has a super-human artificial intelligence, a mind, in the functionalist sense, capable of passing any conceivable Turing test, including tests for the presence of physical and mental suffering.

* On track B a man is tied, who has severe cognitive deficits (or alternatively a criminal, if you want).

You can act a lever choosing on which track divert the trolley. Not acting has an *unknown* result, because the lever is in the middle. Whatever subject is hit by the trolley is expected to manifest unbearable suffering for quite a while before ceasing to function (so to speak).

What do you do, and why?

EDIT: corrected a few wordsIn your worldview our mind and conscience are supposed to be the emerging result of the physical functioning of our brains, roughly similar to a biological computer, by which sensory data, memory and all interact according to the laws of physics.

This vision seems to imply that “building” from scratch a sentient being is actually a possibility, like a robot with a conscience that would emerge from some kind of advanced computer.

If such a robot is a possibility this means that the actual medium by which the processes are implemented doesn't make any real difference: neurons or electric circuits with the same behaviour are the same, as long as the logical process is the same.

Now, according to the [hydraulic analogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy), we can theorically build a hydraulic equivalent of a given circuit so, given such a robot, it's theorically possible to reproduce the very same circuits and logical processes that make it conscious in an hydraulic equivalent, since the shape or the medium don't really matter. One could even immagine to put electronic ears and eyes, as long as the impulses are transmitted to water flows, but that's a detail.

So it seems that it is possible to build (say in an isolated planet) an aqueduct that, although slowly, thinks, draws rational conclusions, enjoys existing, suffers and loves.

A conscious aqueduct that loves you...

Do you think this is theorically compatible with your world view? or where does the analogy actually fail?The following argument isn't, of course, by L.Krauss but since it shows that the consequences of his famous ""a universe from nothing theory"" represent *de facto* an argument against materialism, I've thought of that title.

Let's say that we examine all the relevant facts and scientifc knowledges concluding that ""the universe comes from nothing"", i.e. we conclude that Krauss' theory is *true*. Of course we're not talking, here, about the infamous ""philosophical nothing"" so we'll put that aside and simply state that what we know now is that:

* K) There was a state S, where no material thing exists, from which the universe itself emerged.

a material thing is whatever ""object"" is made of energy and/or matter and the process of how K happens is described in terms of laws (equations, Feynmann integrals, whatever we have) so that:

* K1) Material things emerge from the S state according to precise mathematical laws.

Now for materialism to be true we also need that:

* M) No immaterial physical or mathematical laws exist by themselves: they are only a way of describing material objects, their behaviour and their interactions.

But M and K1 are incompatible with each other, because in S no material object exists, yet physical and mathematical laws apply nonetheless. In other words, for K1 to be true we need *prescriptive* physical laws, that exist and apply in the absence of anything at all, rather than the purely *descriptive* laws that we need for M.

Therefore, since we know that K is true we must conclude that M is false, which disproves materialism.A person isn't made only of atoms.

proof: all the atoms in the body get replaced within some years yet you remain the same person.

Funny fact: our beautiful, perfectly sculpted body (and brain) *literally* ends up to rot down the drains and we'll be alive anyway.

Discuss. (And beware of anti-dualist snipers) :)An Universe perfectly governed by physical laws, a deterministic universe, has its configuration in every instant of time perfectly determined by a snapshot at any other previous instant.

So, I was thinking of this particularly funny perspective, coherent with these premises:

t1: The universe is now made of (almost) pure light.

t1 – t2: The universe unfolds, according to physical laws.

t2: “Romeo and Juliet”, the tragedy, appears.

Since the Universe is causally closed (i.e. no-one can modify it from outside) and every instant is causally linked to t1, the information that produces the book with the tragedy must be already present at t = t1. The intermediate steps, by which this information is worked out, would just be an obliged path, a clockwork mechanism.

How is it possible that we have an Universe that comes with a copy of “Romeo and Juliet” encoded in pure light at t = t1? Who encoded it there at the dawn of the time? Was it God?

Another consequence is that theory of evolution becomes meaningless: who cares about mutations, selection or survival of the fittest, when the “fittest” was just hard-coded in the light at t = t1?

With these premises, every species were written in the light at the dawn of the time...

robotbeatrally,1,8,"I haven't paid enough attention to the info that has been released.

What is the socket system like?

I loved the gems, runes+runewards, jewels of diablo 2.


But I absolutely hated the way they did it more recently in Diablo immortal for instance they just feel like an afterthought where you throw whatever you happen to get in there and just click to transfer it to your next item over and over, they may as well not even be there (even if they weren't pay to win they are just boring and mindless click the upgrade items).

In Diablo 2 there was a very clear set of rules for what you could socket and what was good and rare, and the runewards gave you something to look forward to trying to collect for new characters that was reliable and fun.  It's not the only thing I hated about Diablo 3 and immortal, in fact I found I liked most of the systems in diablo 2 better myself personally but I'm really hoping diablo 4 does something a little more interesting at least if not exactly like diablo 2."
Imissmyusername,9,6,"This just happened, I'm towards the tail end of warming up now with every blanket in the house on me, cat in the bed, and having eaten hot food (that part was freaky, it felt like heartburn going down). I'm still having some affects so my typing may not make sense in some areas and I'm forgetting how to spell some words. 

I was already exhausted from a long day filled with caffeine, a toddler, and 4 hours sleep the night before, I was crashing from the caffeine right as I started this chore so I thought the whole time that I was just exhausted. The hot water ran out after a short time because it only last like 15 minutes tops in that bathroom but I figured I could get it done quickly enough and the water didn't feel too cold to me, even felt a little warm a few times. I'm crouched in the shower naked the entire time with the drain unplugged so my legs and hands got the brunt of it. I went in at 2am thinking it would be quick and when I was done, I thought I'd only been in there about an hour, it was 7:30am. So roughly 5 hours sprayed continously with cold tap water (it's winter and I have a crawl space, that cold water is really cold). I almost dozed off twice in there and was swaying but again, just thought I was exhausted and hypothermia affects thoughts and reasoning so big surprise, my main concern was just not falling. It really didn't feel that cold shortly, probably because the areas being hit were going knumb without me realizing it. I stumbled around like a drunk person when I came out and thought it was from my numb ass legs but I wasn't shivering so I'm cool right? They'll warm up once I'm in bed. 

Climbed in bed exhausted, dick around for about 20 minutes on my phone , legs still mostly numb but now I'm feeling cold. Right before sleep I decided to Google if I needed to worry about my legs being cold so long. In the end, I'm reading symptoms of hypothermia and seeing I've got all but one, loss of consciousness. Checking my temperature, by then it was slightly above 90, cold is getting to me, I'm shivering hard under 4 layers of blankets. I saw shit saying not to sleep so I call a friend to keep me awake until I've warmed up, that when I learned I couldn't talk. I sound worse than drunk, talking slow, slurring, long pauses mid sentence while I remember what I'm saying. I got off the phone when my speech was improving and my pulse had come up, thinking I could probably sleep now, with my blankets same as usual, if only my legs would warm up. 

Pretty sure my reasoning still wasn't working well until I realized I should probably pile all my blankets on me, then I made some hot food, then I made the cat lay under here with me (a cat named Sundae is warming me up). My legs are still cold as fuck but my core temperature is up around 95 now and my pulse is normal. I'm still out of it but that really could be the exhaustion now. For some reason my chest is killing me, not heart wise but like every muscle, I vaguely remember an ab muscle cramping while I was still cleaning but it didn't occur to me that was odd. 

I'm not entirely sure what I've written here and what I haven't, I'm so tired. My friend is supposed to call in a few hours around when my son should wake to make sure I'm ok, will probably walk him to grandmas so I can sleep some. Will update what a dumbass I am when I wake up. I'm super wrapped up so shivering has mostly stopped, my hands and legs are still really cold though.

TL:DR- don't stay in the cold shower thinking you're fine and it hasn't been long. You may end up like my dumb ass with hypothermia after accidentally spending 5 hours in that shit. Hypothermia fucks your brain and makes you think you're fine until you're not.

Update: am alive. I fell asleep immediately after posting this, slept 7 hours under 5 blankets. I was cleaning foam alphabet floor tiles, there were more than 50, next time I'll just buy new ones. 

Oh and I found out why my chest was hurting me and it had nothing to do with this. It's happened once before when I was 17 from a bad coughing fit and I do still have a cough left over from a cold a few weeks ago. Plus I'd breathed in freezing air the night before which made it worse. At some point during all of this but not because of it, I had a coughing fit which caused spontaneous pneumothorax. I burst blebs around my lungs and now air is escaping up through my neck and out places like my ears (or at least that's where the guy at the ER told me it escapes from last time this happened). Now this one really is a huge medical concern because it can cause a collapsed lung so I'm arranging someone to take me to ER now. It hurts to take more than a shallow breath. Two fuck ups in one night. I probably would have noticed the second one sooner had it not been for the first one.

I have a mysterious bruise at the very top of my forehead, maybe I did go out for a bit and it my head. So I posted the other day, scared as hell that the judge would give my ex husband unsupervised visitation. Recap, he has a history of suicide attempts, alcoholism, drug abuse and theft, and he used to beat the dogs to the point of nearly killing one once. His insane behavior with his suicide attempts, drug use, and alcoholism nearly a year ago prompted me to get a protective order. Fucker was crazy and fantasizing in detail about torturing people, I was scared to shower. He asked for a settlement offer last minute, I sent one pretty much splitting the belongings down the middle, giving him nearly everything he wanted, but I wanted visitation to be supervised for 4 hours every other week. He wanted to modify it to let him have our son stay with him every other weekend, hell fucking no. Not only is he crazy, he and his equally crazy girlfriend who he screams and fights with share a bedroom with their newborn in his parents 2 bedroom house. If he even had a bed for him to sleep in, he'd have nowhere to put it. So we went to court. I was so damn worried that the jidge would grant him more than what he was asking that I nearly took his counter offer, it scared me to death thinking him being alone with him but my illogical paranoid part of my brain thought they would give him shared custody, or take him away from both of us because I *used* to smoke pot. Well he should have taken the settlement, I kinda sorta nuked him, like starting a bonfire with a grenade. I went first, we didn't even go through all the evidence before the judge asked him why on earth he hadn't gotten help. In one message he admitted that he knew he needed help. Turns out the judge was also the judge who does the criminal cases for those with mental problems, he said it didn't look so bad that he had problems so much as that he wasn't getting help for it. So now he's ordered to have a psych evaluation done as well as drug and alcohol counselling, he gave me permission to check with his doctor to make sure he's attending his appointments. Ex claimed I had a history of ""drug and alcohol abuse too"", he was vague on purpose because all he had was an old picture of me smoking pot, and one of me drinking a fucking hard cider, he was calling an occasional glass of wine that wasn't even a once a week thing as alcohol abuse. Oh and he was trying to make my prescriptions (antidepressants and adderall in the past) as drugs too, mother fucker a doctor gives me those you dummy! He also admitted to ""spanking"" the dogs, I wanted to say ""you don't spank with a bat"" but I would have been talking out of turn. He ended up with supervised visitation like I wanted except now instead of letting his parents supervise, it's a 3rd party organization that he has to pay for. His girlfriend isn't allowed to be around me or our son ever, not even if they get married, because she said in some messages that she wanted to do things to me that she couldn't put in writing because it could be used against her, well guess what, she didn't have to specify. My attorney asked that I get everything left in the house, I wasn't expecting that, but it wasn't objected to so I think I may have gotten more than I asked for there. He did manage to get his child support payments lowered by $43, I really never expect to see a dime anyway and the judge looked on it favorably to help him with his counseling. So yeah, I kinda feel bad for completely raping him, it wasn't my intention.

Another thing, he's been telling everyone that I lied and claimed he hit me to get the tpo, I'm guessing he never actually showed it to anyone because it clearly says it's because of his mental state. The judge asked me out right if he'd ever hit me and I said no. He was telling people that his lawyer (who dropped him for nonpayment) had it overthrown because I lied, it was actually still in effect though. In court he claimed he had no money because he had to pay the lawyer to get the ""false tpo"" thrown out, kept calling it a false tpo. I wanted to say ""you better shut the hell up, he's the judge that issued that tpo you idiot"".

My attorney said that it looked like his crazy behavior started around the time I got pregnant, he said yeah because things got stressful. My attorneys response was ""here's the thing, life's stressful"". The man never had to do for himself, had a high paying job where he could check out and listen to music for 8 hours, no chores, did anything he wanted, got anything he wanted, the only thing I didn't do was spoon feed him but his life was oh so fucking stressful. Honestly, my life is less stressful without him.I got some coconut oil, I  got it for other reasons but honestly, I've been playing with it. I ended up  slathered in the stuff tonight, so smooth, and eventually put it on my lips. I  didn't realize how nasty and dry my lips were before then, holy crap the dead skin. So, I  made some homemade lip exfoliant, just coconut oil and sugar originally but damn if I  didn't have to add some vanilla extract. Now I can't stop eating it...I just remembered I saw [this](http://imgur.com/LXfMD8r) last week. Every time I read it I end up snort laughing so here ya go. I get the feeling y'all also know exactly where this is coming from.I searched and didn't see anything but I  assumed an under water city would be known about at least a little. Pretty much Lake Lanier is:

>In 1956, a community under what is now Lake Lanier was purposely flooded to control raging storm waters.        

>""There are actually bridges under there. You will run into cars, you'll find houses. Sometimes tombstones, grave sites,"" Capps said.

>And this underwater city is full of tree tops and other hazards that rescue teams are fighting as they search [for a missing teen the article was about].



The thought of that city under there always creeped me out, cars and things just abandoned under there. The water is really murky, you can't see in it, it's a big tourist area. People live on the lake, there's a big dock, huge party boats, a man made beach, they even have a water park. The closest I've ever gotten to being in the lake was trying to get on this big floating raft-like thing you play on but they make you wear a life jacket and I couldn't get up on it, the entire time was spent with me freaking out and not letting my legs dangle down too far lest I feel something. There's a road that goes around it, there's a dam, I take alternative routes to not take the road because it curves and right on the water, I have nightmares about driving off into water so I can't feel comfortable on that road.Immediately? After she's had a drink? 30 minutes later? After she's completely brushed/sanitized her mouth? The next day?

Edit: this helped a lot. I was recently seen off with a kiss on the cheek half an hour later because he thought kissing after that was gross. I felt insulted because in my mind, if I'm willing to put your junk in my mouth, the least you can do is kiss me after. Made me feel beneath him. All this was days after him saying that none of his exes were too fond of oral so he never really got it much, I'm wondering if this wasn't the reason why they weren't too fond of it. I wasn't sure if I was being unreasonable. How do I approach this? At this point I'm like, no oral for you then. If he finds it gross then I don't want him grossed out in kissing me but I'm not doing that knowing I will get no kiss for the rest of the night and it actually makes me feel ashamed of myself like I must be dirty or something. I'm a single working parent to a 2 year old and I can't cook. It's not even a matter of my mom never teaching me because she can't cook for shit either, she knows how to get a bunch of food cooked fast but it's like the same 10 items cycled and half the time they're burned. What we can do is bake, I can bake the most amazing foods. I can't do stove top or pot without screwing it up somehow.  What I need are suggestions for food that is bakable like casseroles but not so messy that my 2 year old will need a bath after every meal, he can make a mess out of himself with just loaf bread. I also can't spend a rediculous amount of time preparing it either because I don't have that kind of time. Kid's living off chicken nuggets and french fries right now, thankfully chicken and potatoes is his favorite food. I just need some quick, relatively messless things that can go in the oven please.

I'm getting a lot if great suggestions so I figure I should add some details. The things in my house I have to cook with are: oven, stove top, large pizza sized toaster oven, pressure cooker, and a Nuwave. Things my son wont eat are somewhat weird and his favorites are weirder but he refuses to eat: pastas, even macaroni, green vegetables except for okra, especially olives and broccoli, carrots, anything the resembles a bean, things with any kind of sliming or mushy texture like squash. His favorites are: things with tomato flavors or sauce but those are messy as hell, okra, corn, potatoes in any form, chicken in almost any form, squash if you fry it until it's almost crispy. Things he wont usually eat but doesn't absolutely hate, just thinks they're flavorless: most beefs, onion, not a big eater of most fruits. I should also mention he's a bit mentally behind by about 6 months, he's 6 months late with everything and we're waiting for insurance to approve him for speech therapy because he only says a few words, this makes talking to him difficult and convincing him to try things pretty much impossible. Like I can flavor some broccoli and make it the most delicious thing ever but I'd never convince him to eat it. I have tricked him into thinking I'm feeding him something else and slipped a different food in, he flips out then realizes it's delicious but that hasn't worked well lately, he knows what I'm trying to do now.Apparently my mom had pissed my dad off before we even got there because she was talking to her dying sister on the phone instead of cooking. Like that's not bad enough, he is taking it out on *everyone*, especially me. My kid throwing a tantrum because I told him no so I'm ignoring it? ""Cry all you want, your mommas not going to get out of her phone"". Seriously? This coming from a man who spends half his time with his grandkids either yelling at them or watching baseball on his phone? Then I'm inside refilling son and nephew's bubble guns and getting their ice cream while my sister and bil are watching the kids outside. My mom sticks her head and and doesn't immediately see him so she asks *me* where he is, do I look like I'm the one watching him? But before I even got a chance to say half a word, my dad *yelled* it at me, like I just don't give a shit about my kid or something. There has been more yelling, mostly at me or the kids because he doesn't dare yell at my sister (she has him twisted around her finger). So yeah happy fathers day, I don't want to be around you, I just suddenly remembered we have to go grocery shopping. I might take my mom with me, I don't know, it would save her from his bullshit for the night but she drives me nuts when I'm buying groceries, if it's not what she buys then it's wrong.

Edit: my mom tells me he's been biching at her all day for not cooking the food right and being on the phone. According to her, he was the same way when her mom was dying. She thinks it's jealousy because she's spending time talking to them instead of focusing on him. She says he told her the other day that he needed to stop calling her so much because her problems weren't their problems. Her sister has been in the hospital for 3 weeks after a heart attack and has several blockages that her doctors wont work on because she's too weak. She also has early signs of alzheimers and can't remember shit, her husband never had to take care of this shit before so he is lost in trying to figure out insurance and all so he's been asking my mom things he doesn't know about. Her sister passed out last night and had an ambulance called, she just came home from the hospital yesterday, that's what they had called her about today.

She also said that when she asked me where kiddo was, it's because my sister told her he went inside with me, then afterwards laughed because it was a joke after all that stupid bullshit. "

Drassielle,9,5,"Not being salty or bitching, I legitimately want to know why this is a thing. 5 dust reward? That doesn't make any sense to me.I've been lurking /r/loseit for a while now but didn't feel the need to actually post until now. I finally hit the 100 lbs lost mark this week and I just had to share it! I started out at 296.5 lbs when I was 16 years old. Ridiculous, I know. It's taken a lot of soul searching, self-imposed limits, support from my family, and taking accountability for my own actions to get where I am today.

I started out with Nutrisystem when I was 16. The food got me used to portions but I still felt that it wasn't for me since I wasn't making my own choices. I didn't want someone to give me a fish, I wanted them to teach me *how* to fish! Nutrisystem did, however, help me lose around 30 lbs which helped me to continue to lose where I hit a plateau at 257 lbs. I know this number very well since I maintained this weight for roughly two and a half years. Though this was *very* frustrating, I never gave up. 

I got married at 19, moved halfway across the country with my husband, and decided I wanted to choose my health over everything else. This is when I seriously looked into juice fasting. I knew it would be an incredible challenge but I also knew that if I was able to do a juice fast, I would be that much more proud of myself for staying on track. I completed a 17 day juice fast and lost somewhere between 20-30 lbs. I knew that this weight loss was very dramatic and had a low chance of sustainability if I wasn't careful, so I spent many weeks afterwards eating around 1700-1800 calories a day with plenty of fruits, vegetables, protein, and fiber. I have troubles maintaining diet and large amounts of exercise at the same time, so I mostly just went on 15-20 minute walks daily during this time.

When I was 16, I was almost 300 lbs, pre-diebetic, pre-hypertensive, depressed, and felt like crap 24/7. Now I'm almost 21, I weigh 190 lbs, I have completely normal blood pressure and have no visible risk for diabetes. I still walk every day and I now alternate yoga/pilates 4 times a week to help with the extra skin (it's not too bad). I'm so much happier, especially now that I just got a job walking 6-7 miles a day as a pharmacy tech in a hospital. I have no doubt this will only help my weight loss. Sorry for the horrendously long post, but I love reading about others' stories. I just hope mine didn't bore you too much.

Here are some [pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/xFTuM)Hi friends! I (29F) have struggled with tasks related to executive functioning my whole life due to undiagnosed autism and chronic clinical depression. I've always seen how other people just seem to keep their house or living space clean and, while I understood the mechanics behind it, it just never seemed possible for me. I've felt lazy and stupid my whole life, ashamed to have any visitors, always struggling to cook in a messy kitchen, always desperate to find a single item of clean clothing anywhere and coming up short.

I've done a lot of research into the struggles I face and found I'm not alone. I'm not lazy or stupid. It is possible for me to have a functional living space. I've looked into strategies that help people with ADHD keep on top of housework (I'm unsure if I have ADHD, but many people who do struggle with executive functioning as well). Through that research, I've identified that my biggest mountain to overcome in daily life is *starting* a task. 

Loaded with this knowledge and employing the strategy known as body doubling, I've started feeling a lot more capable and a lot less trapped. In practice, this means that I call a loved one and tell them ""I'm having trouble starting."" They know by now that they only have to talk to me about literally anything and it takes me out of the spiral-like thinking of ""I have to do this thing, but I can't do this thing. I have so many things to do but I can't do any of them."" I'm the type of person that has to be up walking back and forth when I talk on the phone. I've learned to channel that energy into housework. 

My boyfriend visited me a couple months ago and imparted a revolutionary idea unto me: the dishwasher doesn't have to be packed full for you to run it. I can literally take the dishes, pots, pans, large utensils from *one meal* and run it on a short cycle. I have always waited until my sink was overflowing, things falling off the counters, don't even want to *look* towards the kitchen for fear of just being overwhelmed by the clutter and gross. 

Since then, I've started running my dishwasher almost daily. And, well, since the countertops are clear, I might as well spray and wipe them down. And you can't have clean counters with a dirty sink and stove. I just feel like it's finally clicked for me and I've kept that going for two fucking months now. My kitchen hasn't been disgusting for **two months**. 

Since I'm pretty regular with that habit now, I'm working on getting my laundry under control. Small loads when I feel I can. No folding; just throw those wrinkly things in the drawers because I realized I'd rather have wrinkled clean clothes than dirty ones that bring me embarrassment and shame. 

Thanks so much for reading all of this if you have. It's taken a long time for me to get to a place that seems so simple for some, but this is a mountainous, awesome victory for me. Have a wonderful day, everyone :)[removed]No, I would *not* like to wear what I picked out."

### Motivation and Lead-Up
Last year I took part in the Melbourne Half-Marathon as part of a fundraiser, it was the first time I had ever run any sort of official/timed race. I took part as part of a fundraiser for a close mate who had lost his daughter to a childhood disease. Following completion of the half marathon (approx 1:55), I decided I wanted to do a full marathon. In preparation I completed a 16 week training program twice (I had a year to get ready), and completed two practice ""marathons"", being unsupported 42.5 kilometre runs, over a 32 week period. The fastest time I recorded was 4:16, however that was moving time, if you include stoppages it was closer to 4:25. At the conclusion of the 32 weeks, I had two weeks off and went into race training.

### Training
Formal training for the race started in June, using the same Garmin 16-week program as previously mentioned, this was supported with 5 strength sessions a week in the gym, while strength work focussed on all aspects (upper and lower, every session included hip work (ITB/runners knee), light clave loading and glute work. I am fortunate enough to live in an area near several well-maintained bush trails, one of which is 40 kilometres in length (hence the ability to run a couple of practice ""marathons""). This made for excellent race prep as it was extremely hilly, but relatively un-interrupted by roads and crossings. Training through the middle of winter was quite unpleasant, with several longer sessions taking place in zero degree (Celsius) conditions.

There were a couple of instances where sickness took a toll and I wasn't able to train - in fact I did less kilometres in the 16 weeks leading up to the race than I did during either of the two lead up runs. Further, prep was slightly interrupted as we moved house two weeks out from the race. While I was able to continue to train, the impact of three days of moving boxes up and down a couple of significant hills impacted significantly on my legs, and a week out I had to dramatically slow down my pace (distance was already tapering), to ensure everything recovered properly - I ended up using a treadmill at the gym to ensure I maintained a slower, more even pace.

### Pre-race
Pre-race wasn't anything special. I got up at 3AM, had breakfast and got ready. I was at the venue by 5AM and at the line by 6AM with the race starting at 7AM. I didn’t deviate from my normal process; bowl of cereal and a coffee. There were some pre-race nerves as expected, but otherwise there was nothing out of the ordinary to any other day.

### Race
Having done a couple of practice runs, I was aware of where a few of my pain points would be. The half-marathon also gave me insight into how annoying the first few kilometres can be trying to pass slower runners (not being rude, I'm sure there were people who found my speed equally annoying). I set a pace-based alert on my Garmin to help me try and achieve a 4-hour result, effectively aiming for a pace window of between 5:10 and 5:39 min/kilometre.

As with my practice runs, I ran with a race vest (as I said the practices runs were a bush trail - unsupported), this worked well for me as it was the norm for me and meant I could by pass a large number of the initial water stations. I had a number of energy gels and took one at the 10km mark even though I usually find I don't need it until the 14-kilometre mark. I aimed to take one at each 10-kilometre marker. It was relatively warm and sunny, which I had underestimated as I usually run in the early hours (due to family, practice long runs start around 4AM). My pain points showed up on cue, around the 35/36-kilometre mark. I was able to push through them, however by 38 kilometres they were taking a toll, throughout this time I had been able to stick with or in front of the 3hr 50min pacer, however by 38 kilometres the pacer passed me and I wasn't able to keep up with them. 

As I entered the last two kilometres, I tried to pull up any reserves of energy I had. The previous year, during the half marathon, I was able to find enough energy to sprint to the finish line; no such luck this time. I was able to lift my pace; however, it was like trying to run with two cinder-blocks strapped to my legs, the message was getting there but the legs couldn't do it. However, when the clock came into site and a sub 4:00 time appeared likely I was able to push through the pain to reach the line and tick off the final goal.

### Post-race
Post-race wasn't great. Once I crossed the line I could barely stand and was walking like a drunk, unable to keep a straight line. It took me a solid 5 minutes to make it through the competitor’s tunnel and into the water area. I sat on the ground in the underground car park for a solid 10 minutes before trying to stand again. I made my way to a secondary point where a friend was waiting (he'd completed the 10km race), we had a chat and decided it was time to head home. I took about 5 steps toward the door and had to stop and sit as I was fairly certain I was about to be sick. After a little water and rest I was able to make my way to my car, where my hamstrings started cramping. Thankfully I had some electrolyte drinks in a cooler in my car and they seemed to restore some balance for the long drive home.

This morning (next day), I'm quite sore, but nothing more than expected. Achilles are tight, quads are painful, feet hurt - all expected and nothing that seems to require anything more than some decent rest.

### What's next?
I'm having the next week off all exercise. Really looking forward to the break. Next week I'll go back to strength training, and the week after that I plan to hit the track again. Not sure what the next race will be, or if I'll try and run the marathon again next year, for the time being I just want to enjoy the fact that my first official result was sub 4:00!

As I sit in an airport lounge at 5AM with the clarity only sobriety can provide, I am greatful to have reached a year.

To those of you with many more years than I, I admire you. To those of you starting this road, I wish you strength and positivity. Below is a project I completed using an Arduino Uno. I've listed it here more-so because the better half doesn't care and I wanted to tell someone about my efforts, so without further ado, my project.

This all started out when a friend introduced me to the Arduino platform. I did a few basic projects but was fascinated by the fact that I could use items such as GPS's and different LCD's. In the end I decided I wanted to do a GPS project.

My first phase was something completely different to what I ended with. However, I decided I wanted to pick out specifically connected satellites and print their details to the LCD. Details such as NORAD ID, PRN etc. 

The project used an Uno, Sparkfun GPS EM406 and shield and a 128x64 LCD display connected in parallel (I noted a lot of people prefer SPI, however this just worked for me).

Initially I used Tiny GPS, but because I wanted to actually learn about NMEA data I actually worked directly with the NMEA sentences themselves. Capturing it in its raw form into an array - looking for specific patterns and using functions such as charAt() - I was able to successfully print the data to the LCD.

There were two problems with this, the code was bulky and sucked up a lot of space, and the size of the arrays holding the satellite data cause buffer overflow issues. However it did work:

[GPS Ver 1 - Sat Data](http://i.imgur.com/tlMaktx.jpg)

As can be seen, the LCD was less than impressive and rather boring. Functional, but aesthetically boring. The LCD was driven by U8glib, however at the time I didn't bother learning much about it as I cared more about the GPS.

A few family things later and several months had passed - I hadn't touched an Arduino, let alone the project. 

Then one morning a couple of days ago I decided I'd like to use the GPS to monitor speed (km/h). Also, I wanted it to be far more aesthetically pleasing. So the googling began.

I started with U8glib and tried to learn what I could do with it. What I learnt: the man page was a confusing wealth of information, large fonts suck up a lot of space and I need my glasses to count pixel lines!

The end result using u8glib was as follows:

[U8glib driven layout](http://i.imgur.com/VNxoBPh.jpg)

The only problem with this lovely layout was it sucked up a lot of space. So much so the old GPS code I used to manually process information no longer fitted the sketch. I decided to cheat a little and have a proper look at exactly what TinyGPS could do for me.

All I'll say here is, if you're doing a GPS project, take the time to learn the NMEA streams. If you're new to programming have a play with how to extract the data, it's excellent at teaching the char and String functions as well as teaching you how to properly use/manipulate arrays. However, having said all that, TinyGPS allows you to avoid all the hard work. I was a little intrigued as to how I would capture speed, but TinyGPS took care of that nicely - it even managed to produce it in km/h.

In the end I managed a prototype within a few hours. I decided I was quite proud of this project and was going to box it up and present it properly. I decided I needed one more thing, here in Australia (at least where I live), we have a lovely thing called day light savings, where for part of the year the clocks an hour forward.

Given the dates the clock rolls back and forward aren't specific (first weekend of Sept etc), I decided a jumper wire would do the job. I used a jumper lead as a toggle switch - unplug the wire DST time, plug it in ST. A simple button routine took care of the high/low of the jumper.

The final project ended up looking like this:

[Final project with flash](http://i.imgur.com/TOfvMPB.jpg)


[Final project without flash - clearer screen](http://i.imgur.com/HGCz0L2.jpg)

In closing, I'm happy with the way it worked out. Further updates may include a contrast control for the LCD (fairly simple addition) and the jumper cable being replaced with a hard toggle switch.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm happy to answer any questions as, besides a Russian blog and the man page, it was hard to find much about how to use U8glib. 

Cheers!

Edit: Spelling/Grammar"
lgastako,5,7,"Hi.  We've [created a tool called
Refactorio](https://github.com/superpowerscorp/refactorio) that I think is
pretty cool.  It allows you to dynamically construct Haskell functions of type
`ByteString -> ByteString` and apply them to files (or stdin).  It comes with a
set of Preludes designed to expose functions from various `lens` based
libraries unqualified as they make manipulating values inside files easy (and
concise which is a nice property for the CLI).

As the README indicates it's definitely not ready for prime time yet but it
does work within the confines of the various specific caveats in the README
(and probably a few more not included).

I have various ideas of possible future directions that could be taken -- eg
allowing targets to be web URLs and transforming the responses with
[wreq](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq)'s lenses or database URLs
with lenses to extract / transform queries and so on.

In trying to flesh out a better CLI UX and backing implementation to support
this wider range of targets I've run into numerous issues and deadends.  I am
sure I can power through most of them individually but I thought this might be
a good time to pause for a moment and get feedback and guidance from the
community.

We're open to feedback on any and all aspects of the project but personally I'm
most interested in guidance from haskell/lens masters on how I might deal with
the following in a principled way:

- Generalizing `SrcSpanInfo` from `haskell-src-exts` to any updates done by any `ByteString -> ByteString` function
- Monadic vs pure traversals so I can do something like what I'm doing in
  [Refactorio.Prelude.Examples on the `automate-examples`
  branch](https://github.com/SuperpowersCorp/refactorio/blob/automate-examples/src/Refactorio/Prelude/Examples.hs)
  without `unsafePerformIO`.
- Making the transition from `FilePath` to `ByteString` contents
  seamless/transparent to users so as to avoid having to load everything as a
  `ByteString` and convert to other intermediate formats.
- A streaming approach to allow e.g. aeson lenses to be applied on files larger
  than RAM

Also:

- Anything else I can get right now to avoid trouble later
- Have I missed any prior art (I found none) on similar tools?

Lastly if anyone tries it out for their own tasks (please backup your data first)
we'd also love to hear success stories or cool tricks.

BITmixit,2,8,"So for Ticket sales day we had a spreadsheet ready with 4 groups on it. I noticed on Saturday that 2 of the other groups had 2 slots in them with the word ""**RESERVED**"" in each row. Me not being the official spreadsheet creator thought nothing of it and went to sleep.

Come to ticket sales day, we all try for tickets but unfortunately don't get any & nor do any of the other groups within our spreadsheet. However afterwards I find out that 2 people within my group had sneakily communicated with the 2 other groups that had ""**RESERVED**"" written in those 2 rows that ""**RESERVED**"" meant ""Take the details of those 2 from the group they're in and get them tickets if you get through""

Now personally I think this is an utter c\*\*\*y thing to do as you're basically  


* Trebling your chances of getting a ticket within a friend group with the whole point being equal chances within those groups unless communicated & agreed upon by everyone
* Possibly screwing over the chances of the original group getting a ticket if the other group submitted their registration details before the original group (and vice-versa too) & noone has communicated or had the time to

All of the above has really wound me up and that's without anyone even getting tickets. I've actually been to the festival with the 2 people mentioned above before and they annoyed me then too (stealing chairs, constantly trying to get to the front, moaning if people wanted to go seperate ways for the day for different experiences, spending a ridiculous amount of time getting ""instagram worthy pictures"", DRIVING HOME WHILST ON MDMA, etc, etc)

Now with situations like this I usually call people out on their shite (aka there's a reason they kept it hidden and it's a c\*\*\*y reason) but there are personal reasons (best friend of my fiance + partner) that I can't but I'm seriously wound up by it all.You can't say stuff like that and then get told that there are obvious reasons why she's upset by what he said. That she's lived through it and hearing those kind of things when she's ""trying"" (that part was bullshit) to build a connection with him isn't helpful and he can't even empthasize with her when it's clearly a serious family issue.

I really liked Mick but really didn't like his attitude towards that moment. He should have apologised regardless of if he thinks he's in the right or not. It also doesn't matter that Jess is a 100% grade A cunt. Family issues are family issues and should be respected within a relationship. All he did was send the message to her that her bad upbringing doesn't matter to him because ""facts are facts"".""I'm not just going to marry anyone""

is vs just utilising Node + Webpack (TS, etc) for the below use cases. Want to keep dev environment as minimalistic as possible language wise.

Use Cases  


1. Standard Frontend Scripts
2. React + Styled Components + Whatever else for App based developmentWhy is this a thing? I can't understand why anyone would ever do this but it seems like such a popular thing to do. Some people have defended themselves to me when I say ""Can't you just put it straight in the bin like I do"" with ""It drives out on the side and is safer to put in the bin""

1) It never makes its way to the bin, you just add more tea bags to the pile of wet/dry tea bags so they all remain wet.

2) The tea bags are in THE SINK. One of the WETTEST locations in the kitchen. It's not going to dry out any time soon.

3) The bin isn't going to explode if a wet tea bag goes in. It's a bin, it's where shit you want to pretend doesn't exist goes. Like used tea bags.

Can anyone offer an actual valid explanation to the the insanity which is ""teabaginthebinophobia.""This isn't an actual question. I get why Luke must be trained...because the original trilogy exists but at this point in the story it'd make more sense for Obi-Wan to essentially spend the rest of his days watching over the boy as a favour to Padme to ensure Luke cannot be corrupted by his father at an early age/become Sidiou's next apprentice.

This would also help the whole ""Obi-Wan has abandoned the force/Jedi way"" in order to hide himself & Luke much more successfully. Then this series could still focus what it is focusing on, that the empire needs to be stopped but not really giving Obi-Wan a solution as to how...until Qui-Gon appears to him and reveals that whilst Anakin was special, Luke/Leia are essential to bringing balance to the force and one must be trained in order to do so.

Then the show could lean into Obi-Wan connecting with the force again to ensure that when the time comes, he can train Luke.So I went to a job interview today at a big company (will remain nameless).

The interview was going well, we were all getting along, I was getting them to laugh whilst also agreeing with their points about workplace environments and vice versa.

Towards the end of the interview the head interviewer basically goes ""Right [bitmixit], I'm going to be honest with you here. We did plan on cancelling your interview today but we didn't have the time to contact you. We've had some internal issues this week which means we've now lost a team member from the team you would be working in. This means that we now have to find a replacement for that team member before we can recruit for the job you applied for"".

When he/she started saying this, warning's in my head started going off aka ""That's bullshit, you just don't to continue my application progress and are being nice about it"". Then he/she came out with ""What is your situation like concerning other job roles? Are you actively looking and how many interviews do you have lined up if so?"". 

I said ""I've got a couple interviews lined up for some companies next week."" To which the response was ""Ok well we'll have a talk internally but currently it looks like there will be a 1 to 2 month wait until we fill the position above the one you applied for.""

After that, I asked a few questions and we had a bit of a general chat and then I left. Not going to lie, I feel rather demotivated and a bit shit about it all really. Just not sure what to take away from it.

One side of brain is going: They obviously liked you otherwise they wouldn't be talking about talking internally, nor would they bother being honest with you. They'd just fob you off and send you a rejection email or at worst, no contact whatsoever.

The other side of the brain is going: They liked you personally but you didn't match the job spec and this is a nice way of saying No.

I tried googling but there's *nothing* on the quote, so it's either extremely obvious and I'm not getting it, or it's extremely obscureSo I was looking through the champion list and thinking about pre-rework champions, and old splash arts

I noticed none of them were 2009-2010 level artwork, and they pretty much all followed a similar art style (soft shading often with a very white highlight - not sure how else to explain it) instead of being all over the place.

The closest was skarner who looked a bit flat and less vibrant - even champions like anivia, Morde, Vladimir, kennen, zilean, fiddlesticks etc were reworked in art despite not having much change in gameplay at the time of their art changes (okay maybe not for morde but still)

I think this trend started around 2011 around fizz or ahri release (correct me if I’m wrong - I don’t know how to check when art was changed so it can be even earlier), it’s amazing to think there’s no more panda faced Annies or badly lit cho’gaths around anymore.

This doesn’t apply to skins though, to understand what I’m talking about, compare heimer’s old skins with his new ones and base skin splash. The art style is very different.

Now I wonder: who was the *last* champion to receive this treatment?

Do I feel good then after a minute I'm filled with burning regret and self-hatred for using magic as it's a clear sign that I'm uncomfortable with my own attitude and want to change it unnaturally?So I was reading through enemy codex entries and noticed something about the Ancients...

One of their arms are longer than the other.

I checked the wiki for anything mentioning Ballas but got nothing. However, I did find this on Ancient Disruptor

>Like all Ancients, the Disruptor will knock down players with both their charging attack and by striking with their smaller arm. They will usually follow up with their disrupting attack. Remember that the longer arm is the only one that can disrupt you, and keep your distance.

Clearly their larger arm has ~~magic~~ magnetic powers while their normal arm didn't.

That means Ballas's arm is actually a weapon. It might be how he influenced the Lotus.

Now I know for sure we'll get a melee weapon from this mission, just like how we got broken war, war, broken scepter, and orvius.

But instead of Ballas's boring sword, can we get his arm? It can also have a cool effect like broken scepter's enemy to health/energy orb ability. You can press X on knocked down enemies to put them under a nyx mind control

It's early hours on Sunday the 1st here on the East Coast of Australia. Yesterday was somewhat of a disaster food wise for myself, but going off yesterday morning's weigh in, I'm down 11.6kg/25lbs since the start of the year, leaving me 91lbs from my (interim) goal of 199lbs, and 46.5lbs of total weight loss over the course of 2+ years. (if I somehow lose weight in the morning, I'll update those totals. If I don't, I'll leave them be. That's fat logic for you)

I just really want to know how others who set out to change their lives this year are going? Have you had success or failures? Are you still on the horse, fallen off the horse, getting back on the horse, killed and eaten the horse? What's been going on?[removed]Greetings from Australia. I have a question that's obviously long since been rendered pointless, but since I now have a means to ask it and receive an answer, well it's better late than never. 

I understand of course why the FA Cup final was moved during the redevelopment of Wembley, and indeed the want for it to be played at a neutral venue. That of course narrows the options quite significantly, but I'd have thought the most obvious venue would have been Twickenham. I can find on the internet from that period of time mentions of the FA Cup final possibly being played there, but nothing further. 

Both Twickenham and Millennium Stadium are owned by their respective Rugby Union bodies. Both are of a similar size, built for a similar purpose with (I'd assume) similar facilities.

So why did the FA go with the seemingly least likely option over the most likely option?

Thanks in advance.Nice. "
JakeHodgson,10,1,"Instead of orbs created maybe? [suggestion]I have no idea what's a decent rate anymore without cannoning and barraging, just doing tasks normally. I'm maxed combat and maxed gear except the zenyte jewellery. Thanks for the help i've disabled the launcher and disabled the nvidia and 2k videos but is there any way to skip the legal screen and the autosave icon screen? dear god i hope they have it in the final game because i'm kinda sick of maybe missing a shot or an enemy spots me before i spot them and then the stealth run is over and i'm 2 shots from being downed any way. and then after that having to wait to go down then get revived by an ai teammate and then having to force myself to go down again just so i can restart.I was just wondering if anyone, like me and my friend, feels like ac1 is the best assassins creed.

flying_nihilist,9,4,"This is just a quick analysis post about the pairing of [SS2 Goku](/agl) and [LR Goku](/teq).  
For those of us that don't have [SS Bar](/teq)[dock](/phy) but still want to provide ki and damage to LR Goku, there is the possibility to fall back on SS2 Goku, since they can be used in the same team having a different name.  
SS2 Goku provides LR Goku with +3 ki through Golden Warrior and Familty ties, plus a decent attack boost with Super Saiyan and Kamehameha (if you're wondering if this is better than The first awakened link skill, the answer is no for LR Goku, given his massive attack stat). In fact, it's possible to use LR Goku with both SS2 Goku and the SS Bardocks to realize his full potential.  
So considering this and his (I hope) imminent rebirth, don't feed [SS2 Goku](/agl) to his slightly more useful Teq and Phy counterparts.  
I hope this was helpful for someone!I've been searching around for the origin of this name but couldn't find anything. Is it fan made?  
Still I remember first reading it in Toyotaro's RoF manga but I checked and it's not there.Is there anyone brave enough to try to raise his SA with the UR or TUR version and see if it carries over like the super strikes do?  
It would make a lot of sense to me if it did but it's a huge risk due to low drop rate, I don't know if anyone wants to try it (an SA 2 Goku would be enough I suppose) when they finally dokkan the first one, but I think it's worth a try.  I've proved the theorem for quadrilaterals where the diagonals intercept, applying the triangle inequality once for each side and then combining them, but the proof of the general case still eludes me.  
It would be greatly appreciated if you guys could provide an hint of some sort.  

Just for reference, this is exercise 93 in section 1.7 of Kiselev's planimetry.  
The full question also asks to prove that the sum is smaller than the perimeter but that's straightforward.

A few days ago I broke my Oneplus One by dropping it without cover (yeah I know, that was stupid) and the screen cracked.  
Now neither the touchscreen nor the front buttons work anymore and I'm looking for replacement.

Meatball_express,2,7,"Reddit is a pretty amazing community and hopefully you all can help. I'll try to keep this brief:

On 9/30/2011 I lost my best friend of 25 years. He was my brother in every sense of the word. We didn't grow up near the ocean, more than an hour away but when we could drive we began surfing. Doing so would change our lives forever. From his love of surfing he began building boards, at first for his friends and then for a broader audience. He shaped under his last name: Trill.

The love of surfing has taken us many places and to different countries. He took a solo trip to California and on his way home the racks he had borrowed from my dad years prior had finally failed and broke. Here is the post he left on [Swaylocks](http://www2.swaylocks.com/node/1013080)

""if anyone happens to come across a few Surfboards by Trill, please post something. long story short...i was returning home to the east coast after a month long tour of CA. i drove 6 hrs. thru a bad coastal storm. my racks broke and blew off my roof w/ the boards at 80 mph. went to buy ratchet straps, by the time i got back the boards were gone. they were in the Mojave Desert almost into AZ. there were three boars: 9'6"" triple stringer, 9'6"" sky blue opague lam, 8'4"" blue swirl deck inlay. just curious to see if they made it to the water instead of some trucker's basement..........thanks""

Needless to say he's been looking for these boards ever since. I know it would mean the world to his family to have these boards returned but I also realize this is probably a one in a million shot.

**TL:DR Best friend was shaper/surfer, lost boards, died, I'm looking for his boards.**

Thanks. 

[Here's a shot of us in the shaping bay:](http://www.flickr.com/photos/phiz_photo/3361493238/in/set-72157600134649069/lightbox/)I've been off work for the 4th of July holiday since Wednesday. I've been around my family (wife, 2 boys 1 and 5, and two dogs) for the long weekend. This morning I quietly sat down at my lap top to have some ""me"" time, that's when it started.

My wife knows I'm INTJ and the importance of my alone thought processing time. Generally when I need my alone time I remove myself from the family setting and retreat to a space no one will bother me like my workshop. Today I wanted to get lost in some old photos and have some memories of my lost friend and let things swim in my mind. I got interrupted. ""what are you doing, designing our deck?""

I tried not to get angry it was an innocent question but she could clearly see I wasn't doing that at all. She then proceeds to hover about uncomfortably while I try to get back into the groove. I think she finally got it and left. A few minutes later she's back full of conversation (what she has to do today and that the kids want to go swimming. I know all of this already but I need ME time) and at this point I unload with ""I'm trying to read quietly.""

This makes me feel terrible, she tells the kids to leave me alone and finally realizes that I'm having one of my ""moments"". I've been on since Tuesday after all.

I try really hard to be everything I'd expect my family needs and most days my quiet time comes during work hours or briefly when I get home and take a few to unwind. I get like this when I'm around anyone for too long, I just need to stop.

How do you other INTJs manage your time?
How do you cope with constant engagement of children?

Don't get me wrong, I love my family and my kids but I also have to recharge so I can be an awesome dad. If anything I've learned patience!Hey moms,

I need a little help and I'm not sure where to go. A little history: we have two children, both boys ages 7 and 3. We've been trying to expand our family to add a third child but it's been difficult. We seem to conceive normally but somewhere between 9 and 14 weeks we've lost our last 3 tries. There seems to be no medical reasoning as to why and the only hypothesis is that perhaps she has a rare blood clotting disorder.

Yesterday was our D&E and I spend most of the time in the hospital lobby in tears. I know how much I was looking forward to this child as was she but since we've had two not go to term she bought a Doppler for home use. Last Tuesday night she couldn't find the heartbeat and subsequently called the OB/GYN and went in the following day. It's been a trying week and I can't imagine having to walk around with my dead fetus inside for that long.

So here I am seeking some help from you moms. What can I do to help and support her through this? How can I be awesome? How can I make her feel like not a failure but a success. I'm concerned about her feeling down and depressed. I've noted she already wants to do some things to make herself feel better like getting her hair done, maybe getting something tattooed on as a memorial for the three losses, and finally getting back into fitness when she heals up and can.

Other things that bug me: They do an autopsy on the baby, but then what? What happens to the little life we created? I know some people have funerals for these circumstances. Do we name it? They will tell us what it was going to be which I think will be a bit hard.

Our OB is trying to be positive and suggested going in for fertility testing if we wanted to continue to try. At this point I'm not sure she's up for that and understandably so. I wasn't sure we should have tried for this one and I think we both needed it to be successful.

Last night I bought panty liners and ice cream, certainly I can do more. 

TL:DR I'm scared.I thought you all may enjoy these lyrics, I know I did.

It's a mystery to me 
We have a greed with which we have agreed 
You think you have to want more than you need 
Until you have it all you won't be free

Society, you're a crazy breed 
I hope you're not lonely without me

When you want more than you have 
You think you need 
And when you think more than you want 
Your thoughts begin to bleed

Inthink I need to find a bigger place 
'Cause when you have more than you think 
You need more space

Society, you're a crazy breed 
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy and deep 
I hope you're not lonely without me

There's those thinking more or less, less is more 
But if less is more how you're keeping score?
Means for every point you make your level drops
Kinda like it's starting from the top, you can't do that

Society, you're a crazy breed 
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy and deep 
I hope you're not lonely without me

Society, have mercy on me
I hope you're not angry if I disagree 
Society, crazy and deep 
I hope you're not lonely without me

So it breaks my heart to see that it appears they're severely short-handed when it comes to Xrats. Check out their alerts feed [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FuelRatAlerts).

This isn't to say they're not doing a great job. I personally got stuck on New Years Eve and they were there within two minutes. Two minutes! But I'm a PC commander!

Ubertekk,4,7,"[removed]I was just thinking about that today when I was playing the Puyo Puyo Tetris demo with my brother. I said it looked fun but it's too expensive, I might pick it up used if it gets a physical release. His response was ""How much does it cost, $15?""

I mean, he's not really *wrong* either. The game is Tetris, which has been ported to as close to literally every computer system on the planet as you can get, plus Puyo Puyo, a franchise which hasn't particularly changed since....ever? I don't remember Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine having any mechanics different from this Puyo Puyo and I'm pretty sure that was just a branded version of this game. It's a solid $10 or $20 release, but $30's definitely too much.

1, 2, Switch definitely falls in that same camp, a ton of ""it'd be good for free, maybe up to $15-20"", so does Bomberman. That's not to say that there haven't been its share of good deals, but it feels like a large amount of the category needs a price drop.

Think it's actually this way or that we're just spoiled by the games we *do* have? I'm not ruling that out either, seeing Bomberman for 60 and going ""is this really as deep and enjoyable as BotW"" or Puyo Puyo and thinking ""is this 1.5x more fun than Snipperclips?"" is definitely something that's crossed my mind."

* The Free Radicals land vehicles are heavily modified in a Mad Max style. Adorned with spikes, extra wheel and a mounted harpoon on one of them
* Apparently something smells like a dead corpse in the cave room
* Roper claims his group are ""Pragmatists"" not monsters. He doesn't kill a settler he interrogates and offers her food and a place to stay if she wanted it, but she was also free to leave. This seems to go against the fact they have settler corpses in their jail and that the war rig mechanic ""Lungnut"" want to ""own"" some settlers with the mounted harpoon gunThis is a daily post where I go over one location and talk about it's current inhabitants, notable loot, and the overall story of the location at the time I visited it.

Overall location story
-

Post-war a deranged individual started killing people with traps of their own design in order to loot them. When resetting and making the traps took to long, they switched gears and posed as a religious leader to lure people in and make them feel safe. Eventually when they had a large congregation they used rat poison in their drinking water to kill them all. Disgusted at the smell they left to start the process over somewhere else. I'll take some creative liberties here and say this person is the same person responsible for the Psycho related deaths in the Helvetia church. If so this person may be responsible for creating the mothman religion as seen by the mothman effigy in the Helvetia church. Sometime after raiders began to settle into the town and put up fortifications. They all eventually died due to the scorched plague.

QueefLatinaTheThird,10,4,"http://espn.uol.com.br/noticia/511721_reporter-diz-que-belfort-tem-mais-testosterona-que-weidman-e-deixa-campeao-chocado#sthash.mkZh3934.dpuf

I just saw this on some forums.  It's in Portuguese, but here's the rough translation

""When they told weidman about his T levels, he said ""really? i'm 30 years old and how old is he? Tests vary a lot. I did a medic exam (?) 3 years ago, that was the first time that i have done, and my testosterone was aroudn 300. How am I capable of doing something, how am I training? But i was in training camp. A year later I did an exam again and it was normal. I was normal. So I think it varies a lot""

Then weidman was informed about Belfort's levels, ""When?"". Journalist: ""I think in April""

""Is this legal?"". Journalist: ""Yeah. I asked the Commission if they had did another test to detect synthetic testosterone, but I'm still waiting the answer""

When Weidman heard that, he said: ""Go there and say to him what you heard"" [confusing part? i think he was asking to say belfort's test levels to vitor]. Then weidman proceeds: """"How do you go from low to 1200?"" This is breaking news! But i don't care, I'm gonna kick his ass anyway. But this is a breaking news!""

Then, Belfort was asked about that and he said ""the results were all released, it's all within the normal range. I was tested a lot of times. I have hypogonadism, that makes me produce less hormones. It's a medical condition.""

Highfire,1,3,"Hello, again! It's been very recent since I made [my last post for lore,](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4wjozy/our_three_human_paladin_legendaries_are_all_from/) but I came across a particularly interesting fact in a conversation well, just now. 

There are no minions in [One Night in Karazhan](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4v60mk/the_marvelous_prerelease_reveal_chart_all/), [Whispers of the Old Gods](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4a031p/the_god_ol_prerelease_reveal_chart_all_currently/) or the [League of Explorers](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3rt182/the_adventurous_prerelease_reveal_chart_all/) that have Charge. Not a one. *Woah,* man. I didn't realise it's been so scarce in recent expansions!

Well, because of that, I decided to tackle the lore behind the 5 Charge minions present in The Grand Tournament: Druid of the Saber, Alexstrasza's Champion, Argent Horserider, Armoured Warhorse and the Neutral Legendary Icehowl. This should be a good deal shorter than the last post, which included [Tirion Fordring](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tirion_Fordring) and [Bolvar Fordragon.](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Bolvar_Fordragon) Seriously, I spent a couple hours on that.

Anyhow! Let's do this.

___

**[Druid of the Saber:](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Druid_of_the_Saber)**

The Druid of the Saber is apparently of a faction not yet revealed in your standard canonical lore. There are *many* Druidic organisations, including the [Druids of the Fang](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Druid_of_the_Fang), [Claw](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Druid_of_the_Claw), and [Flame](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Druid_of_the_Flame) that we have seen in Hearthstone as well. Now, as it has been indicated in Hearthstone gameplay, the name of each organisation represents the traditional forms that they take. Whilst [a Druid player](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Druid#Restoration) in World of Warcraft can turn into a cat, bear, tree, Moonkin and more, it is understandable if many Druids in the lore commit to one, two or even three specific forms. After all, even Druid players can choose to specialise as Guardians (Bears), Ferals (Cats), Balance (Moonkin) or Restoration (Tree, or at least it used to be).

So, the Druid of the Saber utilises Saberteeth, the Claw utilises... you get the idea. Let's talk about one specific organisation, then: [the Druids of the Pack.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Druids_of_the_Scythe) Why Druids of the Pack?

Well, I assume many of you are aware of the current OTK deck that Warriors are using, yes? Well, the [Raging Worgen](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Raging_Worgen) has ties with the Druids of the Pack in the lore, and seeing as it requires [Charge](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Charge_(card)) to be cast on it for its use in the deck to have meaning, why not discuss this group?

The Druids of the Pack originated approximately 700 years after [the War of the Ancients](http://wow.gamepedia.com/The_War_of_the_Ancients) (so around 9,300 years ago) during what is known as the [War of the Satyr.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/War_of_the_Satyr) A Satyr is a formerly Night Elven Demon, warped by demonic energies, and there [used to be one in Hearthstone.](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Jadefire_Satyr) 

Scornful of their kin and intending to decimate -- no, annihilate -- all Night Elves, the Satyr began war with the Night Elves. [Malfurion Stormrage](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Malfurion_Stormrage) and his [wife and co-ruler Tyrande Whisperwind](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Tyrande_Whisperwind) led the defence and their forces during the war. During this war, Malfurion discovered a new shapeshifting form known as the Pack Form. Embodying the relentless fury of [Goldrinn](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Goldrinn), a Wild God, Malfurion struggled to control this form, going so far as to attack his mentor [Cenarius](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Cenarius), another Wild God. Knowing of its volatility, Malfurion prohibited the use of this form. However, as has been common in Night Elven history, not everyone listened.

Two Druids began to work with the Pack Form, leading others to use it and trying to focus their ferocity against the Satyr alone. The legendary weapon of the [Scythe of Elune](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Scythe_of_Elune) is said to contain the spirit of Goldrinn, and Druids attempting to control their Pack Form would submit their energies to this staff. The power was overwhelming, and these Druids were then transformed into Worgen. In their vicious attacks, they afflicted [the Curse of the Worgen](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Worgen_curse) upon their victims, including Night Elves, who then transformed into Worgen among them.

Being put to sleep within another realm by Malfurion, to contain their rage, many Worgen would sleep for millennia.

There is more to this story, including how many humans became infected, but this is the origin of the Raging Worgen -- the embodiment of the ferocity of nature.

More information on the Raging Worgen can be found in [this Lore of the Cards video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TParevM5_18) which is 15 minutes long.

___

**[Alexstrasza's Champion:](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Alexstrasza%27s_Champion)**

Alexstrasza's Champion appears to be a horse-riding combatant of The Grand Tournament. Clearly representing [the Dragon Queen](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Alexstrasza) herself, Alextrasza's Champion is again designed for Hearthstone specifically. With this in mind, however, we can talk about [the War against the Scourge.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/War_against_the_Lich_King)

The Lich King's necromantic powers allows him to bring back his victims and his enemies after death to serve him. Some would be mindless, [Flesheating Ghouls](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Flesheating_Ghoul) and others would be [intelligent](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Black_Knight), [skilled](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Boneguard_Lieutenant), [powerful](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Anub%27arak) combatants. Because of this, the leader of the Argent Crusade, Tirion Fordring, hosted the Argent Tournament to test the mettle of the warriors of Azeroth. To use a small elite force would mean that the soldiers who would die more easily would not have the chance to, and they would not have the chance to be brought back under the Lich King's diabolical will. For this, soldiers from every [faction](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Thunder_Bluff_Valiant) and [race](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Darnassus_Aspirant) contested.

According to Ben Brode, after the campaign in Northrend was over with [the defeat of the Lich King,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAIrj_Vqdfc) it was decided that the Argent Tournament would stay. Not to ensure that there are elite fighting forces, but for fun, of course! Alexstrasza's Champion was not present during the Argent Tournament, but it appears that even the Life-binder wants to take part in the Grand Tournament fun and she can't really joust *without* incinerating the coliseum, so she seems to have recruited a mortal to fight in her stead. 

More information on Anub'arak can be found here: [Lore of the Cards: Anub'arak.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6Gb2xu-u_w) It's 40 minutes, but it's well worth the watch if you have the time.

I'll also note Kel'Thuzad as an exceptional agent of the Lich King. [His lore video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlKAGnC2Ppg) is 34 minutes long.

___

**[Argent Horserider](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Argent_Horserider) and [Armoured Warhorse:](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Armored_Warhorse)**

Both the Argent Horserider and the Armoured Warhorse are constituents of the Argent Tournament. Jousting was not just a form of practice, but a legitimate tactic this war. Armoured Warhorses with Argent Crusade horseriders would be able to trample and crush the skeletal legions under the Lich King's command, in order to make way for the most powerful champions of the Crusade to infiltrate [the Icecrown Citadel](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Icecrown_Citadel), the Lich King's bastion of power.

___

**[Icehowl:](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Icehowl)**

Icehowl is a gigantic, threatening Yeti who was captured by the Argent Crusade for use in [the Crusader's Coliseum.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Crusaders%27_Coliseum) Icehowl would be used [as a Trial](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Northrend_Beasts) against Heroes of the Alliance or Horde to gauge their power and know whether or not they were worthy of taking the fight to the Lich King. His in-game mechanic of looking into a direction and charging until he hit a wall is well-presented by his ability to attack the turn he is played with great prowess (9 Mana 10/10?!), but his lack of intelligence and direction stops him [from going face.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jenlSf2E8o)

More information regarding [the Beasts of Northrend fought in the Argent Tournament may be found here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEdHR5ORq_c) The video is 13 minutes long.

Well, this was longer than I'd expected it to be. It's still shorter than the last one, though!

Thank you very much for reading and I hope you found this somewhat entertaining. If you have any questions regarding the lore, feel free to ask. If you have any suggestions regarding my presentation, the depth I go into, etc., then go right ahead!

Take care everyone and may you draw well. See ya!

Edit: Looks like I *charrrrrged* in a little too hastily with this post. I missed out Skycap'n Kragg! Silly me. Here he is, me hearties:

**[Skycap'n Kragg:](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Skycap%27n_Kragg)**

Sky Captain Kragg has *exceptionally* little known about him. He wasn't present during the already-mentioned Argent Tournament, but clearly rides in style amongst the participants of the Grand Tournament. It is unknown whether he is or may be [Kragg](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Kragg) or [War Master Kragg.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/War_Master_Kragg) It is possible that if the Alliance version of events holds true, where War Master Kragg is frozen by Gnomish technology, that he ended up living the life of an outlaw afterwards, joining the Grand Tournament in Northrend away from the forces and retribution of the Alliance and Horde. However, if the Horde version holds true, Kragg is already dead. Maybe he's a *zombie pirate!* If the three characters are all the same then he is a special character indeed, rising through the ranks to become a respected (or at least feared) leader of Garrosh's Horde with, as he says, a limitless supply of [Kor'kron](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Kor%27kron_Elite) at his command. Being defeated and having exiled or escaped from the grasp of his opponents, he set out to live... somewhere, somehow. 

The pirates life was for him, it seems, until he heard word of the Grand Tournament. Garrosh's leadership of the forces in Northrend made him a war hero, which is why he became Warchief of the Horde to begin with. Now that [Garrosh was in chains,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/War_Crimes) maybe Kragg thought to fight just for honour and himself rather than for someone else and their cause. 

Skycap'n Kragg isn't just a powerful warrior and a survivor. This is his redemption story. ^/s?

Cheers to /u/VikingFlamingo (amazing username by the way) and /u/AwesomeElephant8 for reminding me about Kragg.

Hey,

Since coming across [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8j16ch/alliance_kings_and_horde_warchiefs_since_first_war/) and seeing... [a few inadequacies here or there,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8j16ch/alliance_kings_and_horde_warchiefs_since_first_war/dywk7ep/) I decided to make a full-fledged thread detailing in chronological order the events leading to the inclusion of different kings and warchiefs of the Alliance and the various Horde factions.

Let's begin, shall we?

First: any link with a ^v on it will be a link to a video.

Any link with a ^i on it will be a link to an image.

Any character name with ^AU on it will be referring to the Alternate Universe version of that character.

Most other links are just Wowpedia links in case you want to read up about that specific thing or in case you don't know what I'm talking about.

**Formation of Old Horde:** 

Through [the manipulations of Gul'dan](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gul%27dan#Rise_of_the_Horde) in [the slaughtering of the Bladewind Clan,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Bladewind_clan#Massacre_of_the_Bladewind) and [Ner'zhul's manipulations at the hands of Kil'jaeden,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ner%27zhul#Rise_of_the_Horde) the [Old Horde](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Old_Horde) is formed with [Warchief Blackhand](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blackhand) at the head of it in order to beat down the draenei. [This works pretty well for the Old Horde.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Genocide_of_the_draenei)

**First War:** 

[The First War](https://wow.gamepedia.com/First_War) begins in earnest with the opening of the Dark Portal. The whole war is fought between the Old Horde (first led by Blackhand) and the [kingdom of Stormwind,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Stormwind_City) led by [Llane Wrynn.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Llane_Wrynn_I) Llane Wrynn, mind you, is not an Alliance king -- as he dies before the formation of the Alliance.

This said, during the First War, Blackhand is usurped by [Orgrim Doomhammer,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Doomhammer) who sought to restore the Horde's honour. In any case though, he has to secure a home for his people and chooses to finish the war that the Old Horde started. Llane Wrynn is promptly assassinated by [Garona Halforcen](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Garona_Halforcen) against her will (she was ensorcelled by Gul'dan) and the kingdom of Stormwind falls shortly after without their leader.

**Second War:** 

Leading into the [Second War](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Second_War), [The Alliance of Lordaeron](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Alliance_of_Lordaeron) is formed by [the behest and riveting speech of Turalyon,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Turalyon#The_Second_War) then a venerated priest of Lordaeron. There is no High King at this time, though constituents of the Alliance include:

[Genn Greymane,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Genn_Greymane) King of [Gilneas.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gilneas_(kingdom\))

[Terenas Menethil,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Terenas_Menethil_II) King of [Lordaeron.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lordaeron_(kingdom\))

[Thoras Trollbane,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Thoras_Trollbane) King of [Stromgarde.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Stromgarde_(kingdom\))

[Aiden Perenolde,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Aiden_Perenolde) King of [Alterac.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Alterac_(kingdom\))

[Magni Bronzebeard,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Magni_Bronzebeard) King of [Ironforge.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ironforge)

[Anasterian Sunstrider,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Anasterian_Sunstrider) High King (but effectively just King) of [Quel'Thalas.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Quel%27Thalas_(kingdom\)) His High King title is not the same as the one later given to Varian and Anduin Wrynn.

There is also [Daelin Proudmoore,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Daelin_Proudmoore) Grand Admiral of [Kul Tiras.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kul_Tiras_(kingdom\))

There is [Archmage Antonidas,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Antonidas) leading Archmage of [the Council of Six,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Council_of_Six) leaders of the [Kirin Tor](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kirin_Tor) and [Dalaran.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dalaran_(kingdom\))

And [Gelbin Mekkatorque,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gelbin_Mekkatorque) High Tinker of [Gnomeregan](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gnomeregan) (he is also unofficially the king of gnomes). I'll note that gnomes are utter badasses here, as well. An elaboration on that point can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8j16ch/alliance_kings_and_horde_warchiefs_since_first_war/dywk7ep/)

Most notably the closest leadership at this time to a High King was actually ""Supreme Commander,"" in which case, this was [Anduin Lothar](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Anduin_Lothar) of Arathi descent.

The Second War goes in the Alliance's favour, and the Old Horde is either captured, enabling the formation of internment camps, not captured (such as the [Warsong Clan,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Warsong_clan#Revitalization_of_the_Horde) though this happens only after the events of Before the Dark Portal) or pushed back through the Dark Portal. In this time, Doomhammer bests Anduin Lothar in combat but, to Doomhammer's surprise, this riles up the Alliance with even more fervour as Turalyon takes up his leader's broken blade and becomes the new Supreme Commander of the Alliance.

Following the defeat of the Old Horde, the [Dark Horde](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dark_Horde) (also known as the True Horde) comes into fruition with orcs of the Dragonmaw and Blackrock clans, as well as trolls, goblins and ogres under the leadership of [Warchief Rend Blackhand.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dal%27rend_Blackhand)

Not only this, but back on Draenor's side of the field the [Horde of Draenor](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Horde_of_Draenor) is formed under the loose leadership of Warchief Ner'zhul.

**Beyond the Dark Portal:** 

[The Sons of Lothar](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sons_of_Lothar) go, led by Supreme Commander Turalyon, Ranger Captain [Alleria Windrunner,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Alleria_Windrunner) Wildhammer Thane [Kurdran Wildhammer](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kurdran_Wildhammer), [Pretty Shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1j2BMPe7L0&t=)^v Wizard [Khadgar,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Khadgar) and nephew of Thoras Trollbane, [Danath Trollbane,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Danath_Trollbane) to Draenor. No Kings here, but they fight against the Horde of Draenor and prevent the destruction of Azeroth by shutting the Dark Portal down in time (it turns out that the Pretty Shit Wizard is actually pretty decent at his job).

Of course, the Horde of Draenor by this point is utterly fractured, and Ner'zhul's story takes a turn... funnily enough, he goes from Warchief to [King!](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lich_King)

Or not so funny, because his storyline is actually quite tragic.

**Post Second War, pre-Third War:**

Arising tensions through the contentious subject of internment camps and through the conniving interference of the [Prestor family](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Deathwing) leads to the secession of three distinct nations from the Alliance: Quel'Thalas (King Sunstrider), Gilneas (King Greymane) and Stromgarde (King Trollbane).

In this time, King Thoras Trollbane is also killed by his son, [Galen Trollbane,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Galen_Trollbane) who becomes the new King of Stromgarde.

[Burning Legion](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Burning_Legion) forces are sent to the recently destroyed Draenor, now known as [Outland,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Outland) in an attempt to claim what has become ""one of the most important strategic locations in the cosmos."" [Magtheridon](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Magtheridon) kills any orcs who fight, and enslaves those who surrender -- a fate far worse. Through this, [the Fel Horde](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Fel_Horde) is formed under the leadership of [Warchief Kargath Bladefist,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kargath_Bladefist) who serves as a proponent of the Burning Legion.

**Formation of the New Horde:**

Orgrim Doomhammer was one of those imprisoned in internment camps, but breaks out and eventually meets [Thrall,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Thrall) who has a distinct sense of purpose that helps give rise to orcs from their beleaguered state (withdrawal symptoms leading to lethargy). Orgrim Doomhammer forms [the New Horde](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Horde) with the [Frostwolves](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Frostwolf_clan) and Warsongs and aims to free as many orcs in internment camps as possible. During one of these raids, Doomhammer is killed and bestows his armour, weapon (the eponymous [Doomhammer](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Doomhammer)) and the mantle of Warchief onto Thrall.

**Third War:**

The Alliance is currently comprised of Lordaeron, Kul Tiras, Stormwind, Ironforge, Gnomeregan and Dalaran at this time. Alterac has been dissolved following Aiden Perenolde's betrayal in the Second War, and Stromgarde, Quel'Thalas and Gilneas have seceded from the Alliance.

In [the Third War,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Third_War) Terenas Menethil is [killed by his son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Ml7u9IMsM)^(v), [Arthas Menethil,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Arthas_Menethil) who also kills Anasterian Sunstrider and Archmage Antonidas. The second Legion invasion of Azeroth [is pushed back](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Third_War#Battle_of_Mount_Hyjal) through the banding together of night elves, the New Horde and the remnants of the Alliance that Jaina Proudmoore brought with her to Kalimdor.

Following Archmage Antonidas' death, [Rhonin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zAb5OA6pHA) ultimately takes up the mantle as a member of the Council of Six and prominent leader of the Kirin Tor as a whole. [Jaina Proudmoore](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Jaina_Proudmoore)^v founds Theramore and is the leader of it, and [Kael'Thas Sunstrider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEi0z3Bdd8M)^v never takes up the mantle of King, keeping Anasterian as the last king of Quel'Thalas, ever. Even if he did, he would never become a king of the Alliance as he never went back on his father's decision to secede from the Alliance. The military aid he sends to [Othmar Garithos](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Othmar_Garithos) (including himself) during the Scourging of Lordaeron is just that: military aid.

**Post Third War:**

Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore pursues a war against the New Horde in Kalimdor of his own authority, and is promptly killed for it. The Kul Tirans are enraged with the loss of their leader and urge the Alliance to provide them assistance, which is rejected -- the Alliance is already reeling from the loss of Lordaeron. This results in the nation of Kul Tiras withdrawing from the Alliance. However, at *some point* between the climax of the Third War and the beginning of World of Warcraft, the night elves are inducted into the Alliance. There is no explicit confirmation when or how this even occurs, even in [Volume III](https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft:_Chronicle_Volume_3) of the Chronicles.

[Illidan Stormrage,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Illidan_Stormrage) the Betrayer, is on Outland with [Lady Vashj](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lady_Vashj) and Kael'Thas Sunstrider by this point, and with [Akama](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Akama) they [subjugate Magtheridon.](https://imgur.com/4WxBs3l)^i However, they don't kill him, they rather use him for their own ends, and the Fel Horde under Kargath Bladefist changes masters from the Burning Legion to the Illidari.

___

**World of Warcraft:**

By this time, the Alliance leaders include kings Varian Wrynn (missing, thanks [Katrana](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Onyxia#As_Katrana_Prestor)) and Magni Bronzebeard, High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque, Archmage Rhonin (kind of), [Malfurion Stormrage](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Malfurion_Stormrage) and [Tyrande Whisperwind,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Tyrande_Whisperwind) Jaina Proudmoore and [Bolvar Fordragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xoVwM8t1CU)^v (Regent Lord of Stormwind in Varian's absence). Varian eventually gets his return as King and slays Onyxia in the process.

Thrall, tired of Rend Blackhand's claim to Warchief of the ""True Horde,"" sends Horde agents to kill him. And they do. So there's the True Horde out of the way.

At some point, Galen Trollbane also rejoins the Alliance as King of Stromgarde. However, he is slain by Horde Adventurers and is never a prominent leader of the Alliance anyway. Rightfully so, traitorous douchebag.

**The Burning Crusade:**

Horde and Alliance go back to Outland to pick a few fights here or there. Here, Thrall finds [Garrosh Hellscream,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Garrosh_Hellscream) son of Grom, who would later become Warchief of the New Horde.

Kargath Bladefist, Warchief of the Fel Horde, is also slain. That's the end of the Fel Horde.

Danath Trollbane is of course found to be alive, but the notion of returning the kingdom of Stromgarde to its former glory is not much visited all the up until Battle for Azeroth, so Danath's position as a potential king (he is the rightful heir though, by all means) is not much touched upon.

**Wrath of the Lich King:**

By this point, Dalaran is now clearly a more neutral state between the Alliance and the Horde, so whether Rhonin should be considered a constituent of the Alliance or not is up for grabs. Personally, I see Dalaran much like Theramore: a part of the Alliance, but a beacon of peace between the two major factions.

**Cataclysm:**

Genn Greymane of course rejoins the Alliance, leaving three kings present within the Alliance (Varian, Magni, Genn). Garrosh Hellscream is handed over the mantle of Warchief by Thrall, becoming the third Warchief of the New Horde.

Varian Wrynn is named [High King](https://wow.gamepedia.com/High_King) of the Alliance, becoming the first High King of the Alliance since its formation, though with powers much akin to that of Supreme Commanders Anduin Lothar or Turalyon.

King Magni Bronzebeard is eventually petrified through a ritual he had undertaken in an attempt to commune with the earth. [Moira Thaurissan,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Moira_Thaurissan) widow of [Dagran Thaurissan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269mzhaUecU&t=)^v (and mother of Dagran Thaurissan II) claims Ironforge as her own, and due to some bad leadership on her part and the mercy of [Anduin Wrynn](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Anduin_Wrynn) on another, the Council of Three Hammers is formed with representation from all three dwarven clans until Dagran Thaurissan II is of age to take the mantle of King. 

The bombing of Theramore left Jaina Proudmoore without a city to rule, but it also opened a vacancy for the leadership of Dalaran with the death of Rhonin. So she took up leadership there. It's worth noting that the decision to take action against the Horde in the defence of Theramore was not taken lightly: Dalaran always strove for peace and did not want to be for or against either side in the Alliance-Horde war, but ultimately felt it was forced to make a decision as inaction in itself would have been permissive of Garrosh's brazen warmongering.

**Mists of Pandaria:**

Garrosh is usurped by [Vol'jin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0kT3dEOTb8)^v in his [Darkspear Rebellion](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Darkspear_Rebellion) and the [Siege of Orgrimmar,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Siege_of_Orgrimmar) leading to a fourth Warchief of the New Horde. The incident of the Divine Bell also drove Jaina to [Purge Dalaran](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Purge_of_Dalaran) of any Horde presence, and she subsequently committed Dalaran *fully* to the Alliance.

**Warlords of Draenor:** 

Through some meddling of the timeways, Garrosh is able to manipulate [Grommash Hellscream](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Grommash_Hellscream_(alternate_universe))^AU into the formation of [the Iron Horde,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Iron_Horde) yet another type of Horde with Grom Hellscream^AU as its Warchief. This Iron Horde is promptly combated by the Alliance and Horde through [the opening of the Red Portal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifexJ-yeICk&t=) Though the Iron Horde suffers heavy losses throughout the campaign, it receives a power boost and increased threat when [Gul'dan](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gul%27dan_(alternate_universe\))^AU ultimately [claims leadership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfScVNF0AMs&t=) -- though seemingly not the title of Warchief, as he is still never referred to as one.

**Legion:**

Through [the Battle of the Broken Shore,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybtmb_Rrp1w)^v High King Varian Wrynn and Warchief Vol'jin meet their ends. Anduin Wrynn takes up the mantles of both King of Stormwind and High King of the Alliance after his father, and [Sylvanas Windrunner is bestowed the title of Warchief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8BiEI5c6c)^v of the Horde by Vol'jin, making her the fifth Warchief of the New Horde.

**Battle for Azeroth:**

Whether or not either major faction leader loses their position (e.g. Anduin Wrynn giving up High King status and remaining purely as King of Stormwind, or Sylvanas being deposed as Warchief by Varok or being outright killed) is yet to be seen, but one other thing to note is that Danath Trollbane may indeed reignite the fire of the Stromgardian people and become King of Stromgarde again. It's unlikely, given that the place is a warzone, but hey, another potential King for the Alliance.

___

**TL;DR:**

**High Kings of the Alliance:** Varian Wrynn, Anduin Wrynn.

**High King-like Leaders of the Alliance:** Anduin Lothar, Turalyon (Supreme Commanders).

**Kings of the Alliance:** Varian Wrynn, Anduin Wrynn, Thoras Trollbane, Galen Trollbane, Terenas Menethil, Magni Bronzebeard, Genn Greymane, Aiden Perenolde, Anasterian Sunstrider.

**Warchiefs of the Old Horde:** Blackhand, Orgrim Doomhammer.

**Warchiefs of the New Horde:** Orgrim Doomhammer, Thrall, Garrosh Hellscream, Vol'jin, Sylvanas Windrunner... maybe someone else after her.

**Other Warchiefs:** Kargath Bladefist (Fel Horde), Ner'zhul (Horde of Draenor), Grommash Hellscream^AU (Iron Horde).

That took a while.You don't care about what *I* think. I know; the amount of times I've instantly passed by a rant thread or the ""I'm going"" thread is... well, plenty of times.

Here's the catch: I'm actually trying to help on my way out. Not a ""Here's some cynical advice that completely misinterprets something just to get on your nerves"" help. Actual ""I'm trying to help you get what you want"" help.

___

After [this embarrassment of a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5ktfj4/this_game_deserves_a_better_design_team/) in which someone bitched out the design team and made a completely asinine request of more or less firing them, I made a response.

Why's it an embarrassment? In short, the majority of the OP was full of shit. I'm not bothering to break it down. I made a comment and you can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5ktfj4/this_game_deserves_a_better_design_team/dbqychs/?context=3) if you care at all.

Now, what's the problem?

**We (well, you) as a community wanted our voices to be heard, for communication to be had and for progress to be made with the game.** This is the front page of /r/hearthstone where everything but the *last edit made several hours after its submission* (after it was already on the front page) *actually offers nothing constructive whatsoever.* Instead, it talked over the design team with bitchings and rantings that, simply, weren't really valid at all.

It is ridiculously difficult and probably not worth their time to sift through the heap of exaggerations, insults and demands some random player had to get a nugget of useful information in there. Consequently, it is *ridiculously difficult* for you guys to get your voices heard.

Let's be blunt -- Team 5 communication is bad. It may (hopefully) improve. But so the Hell should yours.

 - **Be understanding:** If you cannot see the point of what they say and you feel the need to *consistently* twist their words, you're just going to be communicating on different wavelengths. People get antsy over ""Soul of the Cards"" when the explanation was *actually fine.* Is it okay to call them out on mistakes and the like? Yep, of course. But mistakes happen and trying to tear the team a new one just makes you look like assholes and them less capable of getting good advice.

 - **Be constructive:** If you have suggestions, do the best you can to make them *viable.* The amount of criticism I put into [one of my own ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5ke7l6/constructive_suggestion_1_ladder_system_revamp/) sheds light on what considerations a team may have (or not, I don't know), and being able to weigh your opinion on how worth trade-offs are (as many changes to the game will have trade-offs) is important. Especially recognising that this community is a minority and its priorities may be different.

 - **Be positive:** That thread? It's crap. It's whine, whine, whine. Negativity has done *nothing* for this subreddit. Complaining can be done in a positive or a neutral way, and negativity through insults, whining and blind or faulty arguments only covers up useful information devs can use to *ultimately make the game better.* That thread *should* have 0 points and be nowhere near the front page. And yet it is. People even paid to gild it. It's disappointing and as I'd said, embarrassing that what you chose to voice your opinions was with vitriol and ignorance. You can and *should* do better.

Because the bottom line is this is the development team you're stuck with. Bar some ridiculous circumstances, that's what you ought to expect. If you want to make the game better as a community, then make your community better first.

**Don't let trash arguments envelope the good points you have.** We all want the game to be better -- I still enjoy it and I'm still going to be playing it. I have my own suggestions. But I'm not going to make any of them here where rubbish such as that thread takes such precedence. 

That's the best you can do to try and get your way. 

If you're not here to generate meaningful conversation about anything-HS, and you're still ripping into devs or whining about this or other? You shouldn't have a place here. You should save your breath and do something more productive with your time. 

That's what I'm doing, now. There's fantastic conversation to be had here and I've seen it, but it's not worth sifting through the crap that is unfairly based opinions and hatred.

___

**TL;DR:** You're doing an awful job at convincing anyone you're right and consequently making the game better. I'm going to enjoy the game and be the positive person I am, but not here. You as a community have demonstrated an inability to provide good feedback for the design team, and ultimately made yourselves an unreliable, ineffective source of information.

If you want better, do better. And take care. 

___

**Fun Fact:** Medivh with his Guardian powers is (pretty much indisputably) the most powerful of the Alternate Heroes in Hearthstone. 

___

**Edit:** More than a few people are getting a bit too trigger-happy with their hostility. I'm not going to respond to any further comments. I also very much appreciate who gilded this post, and those that have agreed with me on various points. Thank you.

But, before some of you jump at the idea of me being a hypocrite on account of not responding to people being hostile: I was **blunt,** not hostile. I was cursing, sure, but at no point was I calling you tosspots or making personal attacks. I stuck to the point. A lot of you aren't, and are really trying to your best to find excuses to be uncivil. I'm not responding because this is the exact rubbish I intend to avoid, and because it's frankly not worth my time.Hey guys. Just a quite note that patch notes are up on hearthpwn and it includes the Flavour Text for all the new cards. Book Wyrm's was particularly funny and just thought I'd share the link for you guys to enjoy it and more:

> [His favorites are classic tragedies like ""The Hobbit"" and ""Grendel"".](http://www.hearthpwn.com/news/1646-hearthstone-patch-13921-one-night-in-karazhan)Greetings! Today I'm bringing another lore post after the last one went so well, going [as far as to hit the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4wlhci/the_last_224_revealed_cards_includes_no_charge/) (despite [forgetting one of the minions I should have discussed,](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4wlhci/the_last_224_revealed_cards_includes_no_charge/d67zb5v) whoops).

Today, I'm pointing out that since the Classic set, which includes [Earth Shock](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Earth_Shock), [Ironbeak Owl](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Ironbeak_Owl), [Spellbreaker](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Spellbreaker), [Keeper of the Groove](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Keeper_of_the_Grove) (not a typo. [It's Karazhan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlHx7YNWYGY)), [Silence](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Silence_(card) and [Mass Dispel,](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mass_Dispel) only three other cards that are capable of Silencing minions in the game! These are Light's Champion, Purify and Wailing Soul -- Brode really was telling the truth when he said they were experimenting with limiting Silence, as none of these cards have the freedom of targeting that Ironbeak Owl or Spellbreaker does. Nonetheless, let's get this underway, shall we?

**[Light's Champion:](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Light%27s_Champion)**

First, I deduce with my superb lore skills that this is a human and not a [High Elf](http://wow.gamepedia.com/High_elf) or a [Blood Elf.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Blood_elf) How do I figure that? [He has a moustache.](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/File:Light%27s_Champion_full.png) Mhmm, concrete evidence, I'm sure.

But in more seriousness, the Champion lacks the green lit eyes that Blood Elves usually have from their disposition to fel magic and High Elves do not see too much representation in Hearthstone or [World of Warcraft.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/High_elf#Notable_high_elves) I'm going under the assumption that the Light's Champion is human so that I may discuss Human Paladin origins in more detail. I covered in passing the [Order of the Silver Hand](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Knights_of_the_Silver_Hand) when [I discussed Tirion Fordring,](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4wjozy/our_three_human_paladin_legendaries_are_all_from/) but today I'm going to go in more detail.

The Order of the Silver Hand was originally founded by a man named [Alonsus Faol.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Alonsus_Faol) He was the leader of [the Clerics of Northshire](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Brotherhood_of_Northshire) during [the First War](http://wow.gamepedia.com/First_War) and he was Archbishop of [the Church of the Holy Light](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Church_of_the_Holy_Light) during [the Second War.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Second_War) Way to go up the ranks, I guess. Anyhow, Alonsus Faol as leader of the Clerics of Northshire witnessed the devastation dealt to them during the First War. Clerics were not combatants, and they easily fell in battle as a result of the bloodthirsty Orcs. Faol decided to recruit both noble knights and members of the priesthood. The knights would learn about the ways of The Light and the priests would learn how to wield weaponry and swing it effectively. Effectively, combining the powers of their religion with the strength of sword or warhammer, the Paladins that [came out of this training](http://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Light_and_How_to_Swing_It) were capable of fighting toe-to-toe and channelling Holy energy to [restoring allies](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Holy_Light) or [further smiting their foes.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Judgment)

The first Paladins of the Silver Hand were first and foremost, [Uther the Lightbringer](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Uther_Lightbringer), who was first to present the true power of a Paladin on the battlefield. 

[Tirion Fordring,](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tirion_Fordring) who was one to face the rare penalty of excommunication from the Silver Hand and exile from his own lands after defending [an honourable Orc](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Eitrigg) who eventually became a blood brother to Tirion. 

[Saidan Dathrohan,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Saidan_Dathrohan) who eventually became the Grand Crusader of [the Scarlet Crusade,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Scarlet_Crusade) an extreme militant group of Paladins that often go as far to consider all humanoids that *don't* fight for their cause as enemies of The Light. Though, this is partly because Dathrohan was slain and possessed by the Nathrezim [Balnazzar,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Balnazzar) who as a Dreadlord relishes in sowing discord amongst his enemy's ranks, only to then capitalise on their disorganisation and infighting. [Balnazzar was *extremely* successful,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Balnazzar#The_Ashbringer) as the Scarlet Crusade was a hateful and paranoid organisation that only lost power as years passed. 

[Gavinrad the Dire,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Gavinrad) who eventually became consumed by [Arthas'](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Arthas_Menethil) Legendary blade, [Frostmourne.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Frostmourne) Until then, he was certainly one of the most Holy follows of [Anduin Lothar, Lion of Azeroth.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Anduin_Lothar) It is how he was recommended to become one of the first Paladins in the first place, actually. [Once freed from Frostmourne, it is discovered that he is now Gavinrad the Cruel as he roams Icecrown Citadel. Like many of Frostmourne's victims, it is likely that Gavinrad became twisted after years of torment.](#spoiler) 

Finally, [Turalyon.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Turalyon) Turalyon's power shone unquestionably after the slaying of Anduin Lothar during [the battle of the Blackrock,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Turalyon#The_Lion.27s_lieutenant) and Turalyon eventually led the Alliance expedition through [The Dark Portal.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Dark_Portal) He would be missing for years, [until it was recently discovered that he was Grand Exarch of the Grand Army of the Light, who have been fighting the Burning Legion for 10,000 years.](#spoiler)

The Order had tremendous impact on the outcome of the Second War, which eventually resulted in a win for [the Alliance of Lordaeron.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Alliance_of_Lordaeron) However, during the Scourging of Lordaeron, whereby the Plague of Undeath was efficiently spread by Ner'zhul's agent, [Kel'Thuzad,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlKAGnC2Ppg) the Order would be suspended by Crown Prince of Lordaeron, Arthas Menethil, for their refusal to purge the [city of Stratholme](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Stratholme) of all humans.

Paladins continued to fight the good fight, however, and were led by Saidan Dathrohan and [Alexandros Mograine,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Alexandros_Mograine) a character covered to a good extent in [Nobbel's Ashbringer videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZDLdcW-AbM) When Dathrohan, actually Balnazzar, convinced Alexandros' son, [Renault Mograine](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Renault_Mograine) to slay Alexandros, the plan succeeded in two things: [corrupting the Ashbringer,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Ashbringer#Corrupted_Ashbringer) and bringing a significant portion of the remaining Paladins into the Scarlet Crusade. Xenophobic and extreme, many Paladins went on to form their own order of [the Argent Dawn.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Argent_Dawn)

The Order of the Silver Hand was eventually reformed by Tirion Fordring, after [the murder of his son by the Scarlet Crusade,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Grand_Inquisitor_Isillien#World_of_Warcraft) who assassinated him for attempting to leave the organisation.

In [The Burning Crusade,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade) the newly formed [Blood Elven order of Paladins,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Blood_Knight) who siphoned and subjugated Holy energy from the [Naaru](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Naaru), [M'uru,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/M%27uru) became an adversary of the Silver Hand and attempted to assert their dominance over the Light through defiling [Alonsus Chapel,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Alonsus_Chapel) founding place of the Silver Hand and surrounded by the burning city buildings of Stratholme. I wager that with the ending of The Burning Crusade expansion, the [Blood Knights](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Blood_Knight) sought to be on more amicable terms with the Silver Hand and the Argent Dawn.

After the legendary [battle for Light's Hope Chapel,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Battle_for_Light%27s_Hope_Chapel) Tirion called for a union between the Argent Dawn and the Order of the Silver Hand, combining their forces to create [the Argent Crusade,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Argent_Crusade) which was [the speartip of the Alliance-Horde attacks on Northrend](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Argent_Tournament) during [the war of the frozen wastes.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/War_against_the_Lich_King)

The Argent Tournament, which sought to bring out the strongest champions of the Light, the Alliance and Horde to form an elite attack force that would not add to the Scourge's numbers, would serve as progenitor to [The Grand Tournament](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Grand_Tournament) that we see Light's Champion in.

Now, [Legion spoilers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkDDMSbZNa4) [During the Legion invasion brought on by Gul'dan, Tirion is captured by Gul'dan and supposedly incinerated by Krosus. Under Jailer Zerus, Tirion suffers torture that ultimately proves too much. Naming the Paladin player as the new Ashbringer, the player goes on to reform the Silver Hand yet again, this time accompanied by the Blood Elven Blood Knights, the Tauren Sunwalkers, the Draenei Vindicators of the Hand of Argus and the Paladins of Stormwind and Ironforge.](#spoiler)

There is more to Alonsus Faol's tale, but that is for another time, since it is from that point unrelated to the Silver Hand. Here I was expecting to have a short story to tell.

___

**[Wailing Soul:](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Wailing_Soul)**

The Wailing Soul is a neutral minion introduced during the [Curse of Naxxramas Adventure.](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Curse_of_Naxxramas) Why in Naxxramas, I ask, as I discover that Wailing Souls are actually found in [the Mausoleum](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Wintergarde_Mausoleum) of a [7th Legion](http://wow.gamepedia.com/7th_Legion) base called [Wintergarde,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Wintergarde_Keep) the primary Alliance base in the region of [Dragonblight](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Dragonblight) in Northrend. Yep, more Northrend. It is likely that these souls were at peace in the mausoleum until targeted by the Scourge's necromancers. Because of this, adventurers must slay these souls to avoid dying themselves, as well as to attempt to uncover pieces of a journal that hints towards how to kill the Lich, [Thel'zan the Duskbringer.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Thel%27zan_the_Duskbringer) Thel'zan was formerly [Inigo Montoy,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Inigo_Montoy) Priest of the Brotherhood of the Light that turned traitor when he didn't destroy the phylactery of Kel'Thuzad. A Lich, you see, has a phylactery that essentially acts as a horcrux -- without the destruction of the phylactery, the Lich cannot *truly* die. After a fantastic quest chain in which you recover Thel'zan's phylactery from [a frostwyrm,](http://imgur.com/KbFJKEi) you confront Thel'zan. Inspired by Bolvar Fordragon, who illuminates Thel'zan's past, enraging him, you, he and 7th Legion operatives slay the traitorous Lich once and for all. With the commander of the forces besieging Wintergarde eliminated, the pressure on the Keep is significantly lessened and I'd hope that someone takes care of those poor souls down in the mausoleum. Who knows?

___

**[Purify:](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Purify)**

Quick, make a joke about how bad this card is!

Actually, I quite like Purify -- not as a card, but as an idea to discuss. You see, I've hinted towards one form of purification before, with [the Sunwell's reignition.](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Sunwell#The_Sunwell_Restored) However, there is also the purification of the Ashbringer, which is also covered in Nobbel's video linked above. Simply, the Ashbringer was formed through [a purified crystal that belonged to an Orc Warlock](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Ashbringer#Origins) and through the master blacksmithing of [Magni Bronzebeard,](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Magni_Bronzebeard) whose [lore of the cards video you can find here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsM7XzdjWCI) Magni, enraged by the news of the death of his brother, [Muradin,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Muradin_Bronzebeard) (which turned out [to not be true](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Muradin_Bronzebeard#Wrath_of_the_Lich_King)) brought his all to bear on the crystal over [the Great Anvil of Ironforge,](http://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Great_Anvil) suffusing the blade that is the Ashbringer with the emotions the great Dwarf was suffering. Rage and vengeance caused the Ashbringer to bestow the power of the Holy Light upon its wielder.

Purification of the Ashbringer after [its corruption](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Ashbringer#Fall_of_the_Highlord) (Renault slaying Alexandros? Yeah, that) occurred during the battle of Light's Hope Chapel. Tirion revealed to the Death Knight Alexandros Mograine that he was sent to his death by the Lich King. When the Lich King appeared himself, his power overwhelmed the combined forces of the [Knights of the Ebon Hold](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Knights_of_the_Ebon_Blade) and the Argent Dawn. When Alexandros threw the Ashbringer to Tirion, his grasp purified it of its corruption and Tirion's power with the Ashbringer on holy lands single-handedly repelled the Lich King's vile assault.

More purification, you ask? Well, [Legion spoilers ahead, guys!](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Alonsus_Faol#Legion)

[Remember Alonsus Faol? Well, we're going back to him. It turns out, he was raised as an agent of the Scourge at some point. Being able to break free from the Lich King's will, like many of the Forsaken, Alonsus Faol sought to work in the shadows to do good for the world.

He reveals Bishop Farthing as the leader of the Twilight's Hammer after the death of both Cho'Gall and Archbishop Benedictus.

[But wait, there's lore (spoilers)!](http://wow.gamepedia.com/Lothraxion)

[Lothraxion is a Nathrezim suffused with the Light that serves as a General for the Grand Army of the Light, currently being led by Turalyon. Demons are beings born of the Twisting Nether, where the powers of the light and the shadow bleed together. Do you remember Balnazzar? Well he attacks the Netherlight Temple mentioned above, and Lothraxion alongside the reformed Order of the Silver Hand arrive to help out and defeat the demonic Dreadlord. Talk about overlapping stories.](#spoiler)

I believe that's it for me. There are certainly more stories regarding purification in the World of Warcraft, and there certainly is more detail I could have gone into. This post, however, has pretty far already, so I'm going to call it a full post and I hope that it's been a good read for you all. 

I will depart with some sources for your viewing.

Thank you all for reading, I hope you find the videos interesting. Have a wonderful day and may you draw well in Hearthstone. If you have any questions regarding the lore, feel free to ask! If you have any feedback or suggestions, please do tell -- I'm more than happy to try and improve on how I carry out these posts.
Hey,

I don't usually visit Heroes of the Storm, so I apologise if this has been suggested before.

I'm enjoying the War Chest for Starcraft II and it's reinvigorated my interest in Starcraft lore a bit. Reading about Jim Raynor's history is cool. He was a former criminal and his greatest partner in that time was Tychus. Anyone who has played Wings of Liberty knows this, I'm sure.

Anyhow, here's [an image depicting a bank heist of theirs.](https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/starcraft/images/b/ba/ThompsonFindlayRaynor_Devils%27Due_Art1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110428140241) Pretty sweet, huh?

We have Marshal Raynor, and we also have Raynor in his typical armour and typical clothes, but we don't have him all nicely suited up. 

P.S. Give Garrosh a suit as well. The more characters with unfitting clothes/skins, the better. Banter.***TL;DR:***

The current plot indicates Sylvanas may have ulterior motives and the like, and that's cool. What isn't cool is how things are portrayed *right now.* Black vs. White is not particularly interesting, especially when it continues to drag the Horde's supposed values through the mud.

In A Good War, it seems Saurfang ends up agreeing at least in part with the practicality (but of course not the honour) of the Burning of Teldrassil. This is indicative of an ongoing problem in Warcraft storytelling, ignoring details here or there to rationalise a perspective. In Saurfang's case, the Burning of Teldrassil is not justified by ""Maybe we've tilted the Alliance?"" when you already should have attained an edge through military dominance on Kalimdor -- thus the Azerite it holds -- *and* the ability to make a hostage situation out of the hundreds, if not *thousands* of night elves still on the World Tree.

Justifying the burning of the World Tree in Saurfang's eyes after he originally perceived it as madness is really, *really* nonsensical. It was madness, and you should not be capable of convincing a brilliant, honourbound orc that there was anything practical about it. Seriously.

^(Despite the length of this TL;DR, it's still only 5% of the text as a whole at 196/4105 words, so no complaining!)

Hello,

I just finished reading Elegy, and then A Good War in one good solid sitting (minor breaks as necessary), and I've gotta say... I'm happy ish knowing what I did about the two short stories, but ended up being a bit flabbergasted by the end of A Good War with one particular point being made.^(Disclaimer: this will mostly focus on A Good War.)

With that said, let me set up what I think is a fair opinion on the current writing direction/standard/whatever you wanna call it. *The plot,* for Battle for Azeroth. I will also preface this by saying that I generally like or even love a lot of decisions Blizzard makes with the lore, including many retcons. This is actually one of the few times I've been genuinely concerned with where things are headed.

___

***Standing Concerns for Current Writing/Plot Development:***

 - The current plot direction seems a bit naughty. As in, it looks like the way they're portraying the Horde is unfortunate, because they're shifting them down the route of war once again as if they're irredeemable savages. 

Yes, this is *War*craft and Sylvanas is a *War*chief and whatever. That doesn't really justify bad writing. I still hate that in the Warbringers short for Sylvanas she just decided to down the World Tree. Why? Because Sylvanas being evil is expected -- her being *stupid* is not. That's inconsistent.

 - The current storytelling seems a bit naughty. In this thread, and as plenty of others on /r/wow have pointed out, there clearly seems to be other things at play. Old Gods, Sylvanas' ulterior motives, you name it. And I'm sure we'll get more on that as Battle for Azeroth progresses.

*But,*

I feel very little for the whole Alliance vs. Horde conflict following Sylvanas' short if only because it has since painted the conflict in an extremely Black and White fashion. I know who I'm ""rooting for,"" I know who's in the wrong, and I'm not really feeling much for characters because there is no real internal struggle. The only outlier on this is Saurfang, who [currently resides in a prison cell doing jack shit.](/spoiler) 

Of course his story will be elaborated upon, but the point is that even if we are given lore that retroactively changes my view on who and what is happening, the way things are presented *now* make me feel bored, and disinterested. Unlike my first point, this is a problem that could very well just be be resolved in time, but I think it will be forever a valid criticism because if they end up showing us things that influence how we look at the lore retrospectively, I'd still be asking ""Why couldn't you have alluded this to us sooner?""

I know a lot of Horde players especially are not appreciative of asking ""Are we the baddies?"" once again. The recent Old Soldier cinematic was truly fantastic, and a great way of helping raise Horde pride... but doesn't *actually* address these concerns, except indicating to us that Blizzard is definitely taking into account the side of honour and other *New* Horde ideals.

So, the short stories.

___

***Elegy:***

Elegy was all in all well written and appreciated, especially the gruelling detail it went into with the conflict between Alliance and Horde. It was great to see both sides in their short stories, even to the basic concept of silly mistakes being made by combatants of either side; it strikes as *real.* 

As much as it's cool to think every elf fights like Legolas or whatever, it was great to see how one mistake here or there was also construed as a combatant taking advantage of a weakness.

With that said, there's one particular thing about Elegy I could appreciate:

> Through blurred vision, he saw Genn Greymane’s face as his wife clung to him, and he realized that not even Genn, who hated Sylvanas with his whole heart, could believe it. No one had thought she would put her cruelty before her cleverness. There was no strategic purpose, no possible reason to destroy the tree. Far from it—with this unfathomable decision, Sylvanas had united the Alliance in a way nothing else could.

Huzzah! They acknowledged the decision as madness. That's fantastic, I can appreciate that, because such a brazen action from a supposedly cold and calculating leader cannot be left unexplained. And of course, it's not been explained -- at least not adequately (see the point about ""Evil Stupid"" above). This is just another hint suggesting that we'll be revealed something later on that shows an event such as this in a new light.

I will note finally that the whole assault was made possible by three things:

1. Spies and the ability to feed misinformation. Saurfang capitalised brilliantly on this, as shown by what Renzik got to see.

2. Azerite. The existence of Azerite. Had armies been suggested to be moving south through misinformation in point 1, there would be no matter of believability or even major concern on the Alliance's part had not a substance the strength of Azerite been presented to them. Azerite in Before the Storm's description is stated to ""[threaten to reignite the bitter enmity between the two factions.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Warcraft-Before-Christie-Golden/dp/1785655019/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1533605281&sr=8-1&keywords=before+the+storm)""

3. Severely depleted navies on both sides. Staging an assault on Teldrassil would take years, and in the meantime, the people are held hostage so retaliation is not a good option at all for the Alliance.

There is a fourth reason why the assault was initiated, and that was to attempt to sow discord among the Alliance, and Anduin catches wind of this. Despite what people say about the guy, he is far more intelligent and level headed than people seem to want to let on.

I will say though that sowing discord among the Alliance is a God awful idea. Tactically, it wouldn't work. And there are a couple reasons I say this, and both of them are quite obvious and are bases for concerns with current plot writing:

**Reason 1:** The Alliance just beat back the Burning Legion and did so through unity and mutual assistance. If the Burning Legion's greatest invasion of Azeroth yet and the death of the Alliance's High King wasn't enough, how do you fathom breaking their spirit by giving them *yet another* enemy to rally against? This is Sylvanas and Saurfang's severe and frankly baseless underestimation of the Alliance.

**Reason 2:** In Before the Storm, Sylvanas mentions that the Alliance no longer has any human leaders to rally behind. ""No Varian or Llane Wrynn, and no Anduin Lothar."" But she is missing out one person who is *extremely* relevant here. She remembered both Kings of Stormwind, but not both Supreme Commanders. She forgot Turalyon. She forgot her own sister's lover who had been part of [a Thousand Years' War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsaobgFiiso) against the Burning Legion. 

You *could* suggest she didn't know he'd returned or anything, except in [the Windrunners comic](http://assets.worldofwarcraft.com/expansion-8.0/comics/windrunner-6R2rvc3JU9WzSczV/WoW_003_ThreeSisters_enUS.pdf) which we know happens prior to Before the Storm, her reunion with Alleria should be indicative enough of *something* to do with Turalyon. Indeed, Vereesa says outright to Alleria upon Windrunner Spire with Sylvanas present, ""I envy you your time with Turalyon, Alleria.""

Yes, he has returned after *twenty years* of absence, and yet, something tells me that wouldn't be such an issue when we see Illidan taking the reins as well as he did after having been regarded an enemy of Azeroth. Turalyon is one of the Alliance's most revered heroes.

So I'm glad that Anduin saw through it, and I'm glad that Greymane confirmed the insanity of it by calling Anduin a fool if he'd ever thought he'd put the reclamation of Gilneas before the retaking of Teldrassil and freeing of its inhabitants from the Horde occupation.

Because it truly is ridiculous to suspect that the Alliance leadership could fracture because they don't have a human, or when they've faced the Burning Legion straight-on.

___

***A Good War:***

A Good War is where most of the rationale and many questions arise, in my opinion. Elegy is about the losing battle, and the tragedy of the burning of Teldrassil. About the incomprehensible nature of such an act.

A Good War is about... a little bit more than that.

As a small, positive aside: I *love* the almost banterous nature between Varok Saurfang and Nathanos Blightcaller when Saurfang leads him onto the trickery he is trying to play the Alliance under. Great interaction there.

Now, in order the short story gives this things in:

First, [a hint towards Sylvanas not being simply insane.](https://imgur.com/QJR4ChA)

> The warchief had done very well in giving the reins of this plan to the orc, Nathanos had to admit. Saurfang had learned warfare before he had learned to walk, and it showed. His reputation and legacy were well earned. He had sacrificed much for his people, and the Horde trusted him to make the right decisions, even in dark days.

> Although, Sylvanas has earned that reputation a thousand times over, yet she is still mistrusted. Too many in the Horde were short-sighted and weak-willed. Sylvanas had seen what lay beyond this life. She knew what waited on the other side. What else could she do but act on that knowledge? If her actions sometimes seemed cruel, well, life was cruel. Existence was fleeting. Her plans soared over the horizon of mortality, and that frightened many.

> It did not frighten Nathanos. It delighted him.

> Saurfang twisted in his seat, looking at Nathanos. 

Oh look, ulterior motives and plans. Now, we have been alluded stuff like this in, say, the Windrunner comic. She clearly is not *just* all for the Horde and whatever.

But, the way it is phrased here is far better than ""Eventually, they will all serve me.

They will all serve... death.""

Because seriously that just sounds unambiguously evil and voodoo baddie-like. This sounds like Nathanos is at least a little bit in on her machinations and, equally importantly, he doesn't necessarily perceive what they do as strictly evil. It's not explicit, however this here strikes me as ""We do *what we must,*"" very much an ends justify the means kind of thing.

And let's make no mistake; it seems abundantly clear from various sources that Sylvanas acknowledges herself as a monster. She isn't morally ignorant, she is morally deficient -- she *knows* much of what she does is wrong, but in the name of pragmatism she often does it anyway. That doesn't mean it isn't evil, but at least then it isn't Evil Stupid.

Secondly, [Sylvanas is willing to put her unlife on the line:](https://imgur.com/kzElwkm)

> Sylvanas stepped closer to the wisps, regarding them calmly. Saurfang ground his teeth but said nothing. She faced down the wall of swarming lights as though it were Malfurion himself. And perhaps, that was not inaccurate.

> Sylvanas spun around. “I am prepared to duel Malfurion alone.”

> Saurfang wasn’t sure he had ever heard a worse idea, not with circumstances this dire. “Warchief—”

> She cut him off. “I know. I would be facing him, his remaining army, and the spirits of his ancestors by myself. That will be … difficult to overcome,” she said dryly. “But we almost have them. I will not retreat.”

> The night elven ships fired again. Shots landed close by, explosions sending geysers of sand leaping into the air. A few of Saurfang’s guards flinched. Sylvanas didn’t. Neither did Saurfang. They’re just testing their range, he knew.

> “Wisps are dangerous only in large numbers,” Saurfang said. “Can you … kill them, Warchief? Enough of them?”

> Sylvanas eyed the wisps for a few moments, then shook her head. “Not enough to matter. But we can disperse them. Take anyone you need, Saurfang, and go into Felwood. Find a path over the mountains into Darkshore, and sweep into this forest from the rear. When I hear the attack begin, I will lead the remainder of the Horde through the front. We will squeeze Malfurion from both sides. He will fall today.”

When we already know from [Edge of Night](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/short-story/leader-story/sylvanas-windrunner) (and supplemented further by [this quote](https://imgur.com/cYeRMFf) later on) that Sylvanas cherishes her own self-preservation if only to avert oblivion/Hell, we can appreciate some complexity and arguably even a degree of selflessness in her actions and plannings here. She has *repeatedly* risked her life in Battle for Azeroth as we know, and while we could understand her being bold in an attempt to secure the best future she can for herself (and even the Horde), it is heartening to see her willing to put herself to the test and take grand risks to achieve these goals.

Now, we go [later on to after Malfurion has been spared by Varok Saurfang.](https://imgur.com/IBqVAws)

> This battle was not about a piece of land. Even Saurfang knew that. Taking the World Tree was a way to inflict a wound that could never heal. Losing their homes and their leaders would have ended the kaldorei as a nation, if not a people. Even the loss of one leader would have been enough to create a tide of despair. The wounds of this battle would have bled, festered, decayed, and rotted the Alliance from the inside out. Anduin Wrynn would have lashed out in a final, desperate war, looking for a miracle, because only a miracle would save them.

> But a miracle already had. A miracle granted by the honorable hand of a foolish old orc.

> And an overconfident warchief. Best to lay blame where it belonged. This was her mistake as much as Saurfang’s.

> This conquest of Darnassus would rattle the kaldorei people. They would grieve for their lost, fear for their imprisoned, and tremble at the thought of the Horde ransacking their homes. But they would not fall to despair. Not anymore. Malfurion’s impossible survival would give them hope. Their wound would heal. Even in this dark hour, they would say, Elune still watches over us.

> And that was almost certainly true, wasn’t it? Elune had intervened. Perhaps she had even stayed Saurfang’s killing blow. And she wouldn’t be the only force beyond the Alliance to oppose Sylvanas’s true objective. 

So the first thing is, this gives pretty damning evidence that Sylvanas' idiocy in letting Malfurion live was indeed her own idiocy. *She blames her own overconfidence,* so it's really hard to say that her inner-monologue criticising herself is going to be wrong.

That, honestly, sucks a bit, but I guess that's the best we can get from a situation where she lets one of her two *primary objectives* get away. It's a shit excuse, I'd still say it's a bad plot, but it's written as best as it could be.

The second thing however is of course the ""true objective"" bit. Blizzard has been really, *really* good given us sod-all in regards to what Sylvanas is doing and what her true motives are besides self-preservation. This is just another wink to the notion that she has more going on than we're led to believe. This is good, because I prefer her not being 2-dimensionally evil, even if this quote still shows she's being at least a little Evil Stupid. 

Again, bad plot but the best writing they can achieve for it I guess.

I will also say that this seems to ignore what I'd have thought would have been one of the biggest cruxes about capturing Teldrassil as was identified earlier: *hostages.* Retaliation is not so easy when you have something you can very easily, very quickly lose as a result of that. Hostages would be the best hope the Horde would ever have of spreading discord within the Alliance, between those who want to act and those who would hesitate. You would *never* get the Alliance split over *how* to act, only whether they could because thousands of lives are at risk otherwise. More on that, later.

[Here, we once again see an acknowledgement of madness.](https://imgur.com/T5c0XoT) 

> “Why …? Why …?” Saurfang breathed. He looked again at Nathanos. The Forsaken’s eyes were wider than the orc had ever seen. 

> Sylvanas had her back to Saurfang, watching the fire spread. Saurfang tried—desperately
tried—to rationalize her order.

> Did that dying elf tell her something? Were they planning to resist? Is the Alliance about to arrive with reinforcements?

> A dozen different explanations rushed through his mind. They all died quickly. There were no sails on the horizon. A couple of kaldorei ships were frantically moving away from the World Tree as burning branches rained down upon them. Even the captured ships were awkwardly steering out of the way. They had not expected this.

> Nobody had.

> What about Sylvanas?

> That thought struck Saurfang cold.

> Was this her plan all along?

> No. It couldn’t have been. She’d had a strategy in mind. Conquering the World Tree—taking it intact—would have been a brilliant move. Destroying it was …

> … madness.

> The entire tree was now engulfed in flames. Shimmers of blue and white grew and faded as the fire burned hotter and hotter. The edge of the fire circled around the tree. And then, the city of Darnassus began to burn. 

I don't have much to say about this, for one simple reason.

[They basically take it all back and say ""Screw logic"" in the next bit.](https://imgur.com/WIQctCp)

> “They will come for us now. All of them!” he said.

> “I know.” She was calm, as though nothing were wrong. “They will attack the Undercity in retaliation. You will need to plan our defenses. Begin evacuating my people.”

> He struggled to form words. Finally, pure hatred made him spit out a condemnation. “You have damned the Horde for a thousand generations. All of us. And for what? For what?”

> Her expression didn’t waver. “This was your battle. Your strategy. And your failure. Darnassus was never the prize. It was a wedge that would split the Alliance apart. It was the weapon that would destroy hope. And you, my master strategist, gave that up to spare an enemy you defeated. I have taken it back. When they come for us, they will do so in pain, not in glory. That may be our only chance at victory now.”

> He wanted to kill her. He wanted to declare mak’gora and spill her blood in front of Horde
and Alliance alike.

> But she was right.

> A wound that can never heal. That had always been the plan. And Saurfang had failed to inflict it. The story of Malfurion’s miraculous survival would have spread among the armies of the Alliance as proof that they were blessed in their cause.

> War would still have come. That had been certain the moment Saurfang had led the Horde into Ashenvale. And it would have been what he had feared most: the meat grinder, spending so many lives to achieve so little, ending with a whimper, and thus dooming future generations to a war nobody could win. Once again, Sylvanas had seen it before he had.

I have to say, what on earth is the logic behind this? No no, I can see that it is well explained within the quote above, but...

This has been a recurring theme of characters apparently just, *forgetting* details. Important details, when they're meant to be brilliant tacticians. And here, they have forgotten two incredibly huge details that have already been mentioned:

1. Prisoners. A hostage situation. This is again what I thought would have been the best thing to hold against the Alliance, and Sylvanas threw away this bargaining chip in a *massacre.* Evil Stupid.

2. ""Our only hope is to provoke them so much their vein pops out""? I'm sorry, did we forget about *how you just secured a continent and its Azerite?!*

Point 1 is ludicrous to me because those prisoners could have been extremely valuable, as was thought from the outset of this grand undertaking. Sylvanas threw it away for no real reason and while her being Evil Stupid is bad enough, *why the Hell is Varok Saurfang being won over by her atrocious logic?* 

He full on acknowledges that taking the Tree would have been a brilliant move. How does that suddenly go out the window by Sylvanas saying ""My grand strategy is to *tilt the Alliance into losing a war.*""

Look, if she was reaching for some shit all justification and she has ulterior motives or whatever, *fine.*

But the fact that Saurfang fell for this when he had not only the prisoners to consider, *but the Azerite that they would have had greater access to regardless,* is flabbergasting. *Flabbergasting.* I have no idea how a commander of his experience, so capable as to make the burning *or* occupation of Teldrassil so possible, overlooks these two overbearing advantages that the Horde would have possessed should they occupy Teldrassil.

Couple that with Sylvanas seemingly forgetting about Turalyon's existence, and both of them underestimating the Alliance and their unity *despite them having just stuck together through the Burning Legion's invasion,* and... I guess it's just extremely unfortunate how reasonable I find it to be concerned with the plot at this point.

At least Varok feels shame and dishonour at this point, but there's no real justification for what seems to be his agreement with the practicality of the Burning of Teldrassil, truly.

Overall, the current plot the way we understand it makes me very concerned for the story of Battle for Azeroth. The Burning of Teldrassil is the cornerstone of the expansion, the catalyst to war, and it seems to have been founded on some very, very bad decisions and misunderstandings.

Even if some or most of these details are addressed, like Sylvanas not being as ignorant or emotional or simply stupid as she appears, it still makes me question why the story had to be told *in this way,* with very little hint of moral greyness or interest between the Alliance Horde conflict.

Oh look, your plan was to piss to the Alliance off.

I guess you succeeded -- I'm not sure what you're hoping from that, but now you've just ignited war, because, war. 

___

***Closing Thoughts:***

Overall, it's just very disappointing to have had Sylvanas' Warbringers short be so disappointing with an anticlimactic answer to the ""Who dunnit?"" of Teldrassil. The problems associated with the plot from such a video appear to be glaring. It was easily forgiveable in just Before the Storm for Sylvanas to ignore Turalyon's existence. That one thing by itself is hardly merit for big complaint.

But continuing that theme of unusual ignorance from not just Sylvanas', but Saurfang's perspective indicates to me one very simple decision of bad writing: we wanted a Horde-Alliance conflict to reignite, so we will actively ignore certain story elements to achieve that. Even, it seems, Saurfang's sensibilities as a tactician or Sylvanas' intelligence.

If anyone ended up reading all of this, good on you. In any case, thanks for giving this the light of day and I appreciate knowing your thoughts about this as well. I know there's a lot of criticisms here or there on the storytelling or the lore, or even criticisms of criticisms, so hopefully this provides a fairly comprehensive basis for people to understand why I am discontent with the lore (and hopefully an appreciation for why that's reasonable)."

Long-Night-Of-Solace,4,7,"Hi all,

I love this app but this problem is really grinding my gears.

If I open a link in the internal browser and then leave the app (eg by opening my list of previous apps and selecting one, or minimising Relay, or using ""Okay Google"") when I come back to it the page is blank and I have to swipe up to the comments, swipe back down to reload the page, and then find where I was.  Maddening.

Normal refresh commands like swiping down from the top of the screen don't work.

Is anyone else experiencing this?

Edit: Pixel 2 XL, Relay version 9.0.11, android version 8.1.0Hi all,

This doesn't seem to be addressed in the FAQ or elsewhere but if it has already been raised and answered please forgive me.

I think we're all on the same page that the best/only way to address the worst of the work-related injustices and horrors we're unhappy about, and the best/only way to put an end to work as we know it, is by unionism.

So I'm surprised that this place isn't more active in driving union membership.  I'd be very happy to contribute to that process in any way I can because I recognise that unionism is our only legitimate option.

I'm more interested in whether there's a reason that this glaring option just gets a few mentions in the FAQ and not much else.

Edit: Based on the commentary so far, it seems that the general attitude to unions around here is: ""We hate capitalists, but let's do exactly what they want regardless. Wouldn't want to challenge their power or reshape society or anything.""A lot of the windows that pop up have a second or two of delay where you can't dismiss them, to prevent situations where they pop up just when you're hitting A (on xbox) for some other reason and get instantly dismissed. But not all of them.

It keeps happening to me: Just now I was in my shipyard menu and some other window popped up just as I was selecting something so it was immediately dismissed. It would have been on my screen for literally about an eighth of a second. 

Any way to go back and see what it said?

Thanks in advance!Hey all,

Someone recently linked a text post of a terrible dad joke from five years ago, and since I love terrible dad jokes I wanted to save it. No dice! I can't spot an option in the drop-down list or in the options below the text (there with ""Sort by"" for comments). I couldn't just go back to the main r/jokes list because I had followed a direct link to get there.

Seems like an oversight (possibly by me). If I'm missing something, can someone point it out for me please?  And if not, I suggest some attention on this issue.Hi all,

So the Ether Drake is in my space, and while science and construction ships have the sense to go around, military ships will just dive headlong into death unless I manually ask them to go around.

Is there any way to get them to act like civilian ships in this regard?

Thanks!I love this game because it's so meditative and calming, but I opened the app just now and now it just feels irksome. 

I had a win streak before work this morning, beat a level, and closed the app. When I opened it again my win streak was set to zero.

Not the end of the world, but I'd like to know if this is just a thing that I should expect to happen from time to time.

Thanks!Hi!  So my manager has some bizarre ideas about how OneNote works, and now I'm dealing with this really slow and ridiculous way of using it rather than having it function the way it's supposed to.

I don't know the technical detail of how it is supposed to be set up, but I'm certain it's not supposed to be this difficult.  There are plenty of videos online describing how to use it once it is set up, but nothing I can find which explains how to make it talk to my colleagues' OneNotes.

I'd like to chat with someone about how it's supposed to be set up to communicate/collaborate, so I can confirm that I'm right that it should be much easier than this, and just to get a bit of guidance about demonstrating that to my manager.

I'll pay you for your time, and if I can get through to my manager I'll attempt to get you the work of setting it up for us.

This is driving me insane so I'd be extremely grateful for the assistance of someone with some experience here.I'm sure it was explained at some point but I can't remember and can't work it out. 

For instance I killed the daily brutal just now and got six of them. I can't even work out where I can see how many I've got. 

I'm probably missing something super obvious. Any help would be appreciated!Hi,

So this morning I went to tap a thumbnail and I think I accidentally dragged it to the left or something because all the thumbnails shifted to the left.

In my settings, ""Thumbnails on left"" is suddenly checked. No bother, I just uncheck it. Nothing happens. I open settings, and it's checked again. 

Anyone got any suggestions?"
pcprincipal69,3,5,"This wouldn't be a drop in the bucket to reduce CO2 emissions. Australia did the same thing and they already got rid of it in 2014.

It raises the cost of living because it increases your hydro bill, cost of food, and the price at the pump.

Let's let China be the leader on this issue.I've only recently been following politics, but I saw a post from /r/LateStageCapitalism on /r/all and submitted a post asking if they were for communism, which led to an [interesting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/5fv8pj/would_people_here_prefer_communismsocialism_over/?st=iw6al9vu&sh=9365f29b).

Is it the education system and not teaching world history? Is it media and globalists? Or is communism really a great thing that we should try again because the people who tried it 'didn't do it right'?



Just wondering, that's the gist that I'm getting. If not, what kind of society are you wanting?[removed]I swear it wasn't like this before the patch. When playing Ana and healing someone who isn't full health you get a distinct sound effect for the duration of the heal (0.9s or until they are fully healed).

However when healing someone's shield HP you no longer hear this sound effect. It's obviously not game breaking, and is something that I'll probably adjust to quite quickly, but for now it's throwing me off making me think I missed the heal when I do a quick unscoped flick heal."

Unfairbeef,6,4,"Did the sub just run its course and this is what is left? It seems like most of the food videos here are just foreign cooking videos and zero 'collaboration' cooking content. I don't inherently have an issue with that at all, it just isn't what I thought this sub was. I don't mean to demean or disparage any of the current posters in any way. I just want o know if this is what it was/is meant to be or if this is just what happens when you leave a sub to become free range.I started a cook last night and set it to 24 hours (two eye of round). This morning I woke up to a notification that the time was up and it was sitting at 118f. I have no way of telling how long it was under temp. The container is well insulated so it could have been quite a while. Does anyone know of a log that I can access to determine when/what happened? And, after sitting below temp, is the meat still safe to eat after finishing out the cook (adding some time to compensate)?

Edit: The android notification log shows an event from Anova at 3:54 am. I turned it back on at about 6:45 am. I am going to test how quickly it cools down this evening to see if that time frame matches the alert > power back on time frame. If it matches, that's roughly 3 hours that it sat under temp.

Edit 2: I started the cook at 11pm at 131f.

Time table:

11:00 pm: start cook at 131f

3:54 am: time is up notification, heating stops

6:45 am: temp is 118f, started heating again

6:56 am: temp reaches 131f again

Edit 3: [The setup.](http://imgur.com/a/Hjdqg)

Edit 4: After much deliberation, research and flipflopping- I ate the meat last night. I did not die. Thank you everyone for your advice and info!

I would like to know if any of you have any tips on achieving that at home with standard equipment. I do not want to make it with ground meat (that is a different product in my mind), I already slice against the grain and on the bias, I have tenderized with a hammer, I use a marinade that contains apple cider vinegar and have tried lower temp and longer dehydration.

I am starting to think that the only way to obtain that texture is to cure the meat with prague powder #1 and leave a good bit of moisture in the meat. 

Any ideas?The [all-in-one style guide on ChefSteps](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/sous-vide-time-and-temperature-guide) has a lot of info on it that I want to utilize. However, I didn't see anything about the expected starting temp of the meat. I have mainly cooked larger cuts so far and have enjoyed the haphazard time frame margins that they afford. What do you do?Just a simple dumb question. I ended up having to leave two batches of sliced meat curing for 7 days. Any issues with that at all? I want to smoke it and dehydrate it or just dehydrate it at 130-140f for some hours until it is pleasing. 

Edit: one batch is top round thinner slices, one is pork tenderloin thick slices

Edit 2: I used prague powder #1 with each, if that makes a difference; they still smell 'not rotten'

Edit 3: The meat smelled and looked fine so I dehydrated it as I normally would. It came out delicious and hasn't killed me. Thanks for all the advice!"

/u/attacker3Hello folks,

I see a lot of start ups fail early and quickly. They seem to fail because they overestimate their selling ability or their ability to plan ahead. Just because your service/product is unique does not mean it will sell. Make sure it is a viable business before you take the huge step into spending all your savings on starting the business. Start at a small scale and see what happens.

If you dump all your funds into it and it goes belly up, what can you do? You do not want to end up broke and depressed because you thought your idea would work. Plan for the unexpected. Have backups for backups. 

Go over your business plan and your name. Have people you trust look at it. 

Most importantly, do you research. Research your market, set your prices accordingly.With that I meant, do not trade with someone who randomly adds you on Steam. Although some of the people may actually be legit, you can't be sure for all of them. The best thing to do, is to post your thread and make sure that anyone who wants to trade posts on that thread. If they add you randomly, be sure to verify their identity by checking on here or steamrep. Because usually you will find that that person is banned from here or has bad rep on Steamrep. And be sure to read all of the rules before getting started here on SGS. They are put in place to keep the place scam-free. 

Enjoy your day!Post a comment and I'll run the comments through a randomizer thing and we'll have our winner. Winner decided on Thursday 03/22/2018

Hi all, I got these extra keys from Humble Monthly and decided, ayyyy I bet some peeps on GOG will want them. All you have to do is reply here and I will give the game to the first person who asks for it. Also I lost my custom flair so want to just say fuck you mini, fuck you freedom, fuck you antim."
blu1996,4,7,"Title. If the Dementors performed the kiss on Harry, what would have happened? 


Edit: Would make for a really interesting fan fiction. Harry Potter dead at the end of POA and Voldemort returning a year earlier in Harry's body. I sorta wonder what it would have been like if this were the alternate universe we got in Cursed Child. If Albus and Scorpius went back even earlier and fucked up the ending of POA. The intent is to provide workers with a sense of pride and accomplishment for slaving away in order to push someone else’s product.  In my opinion, it's the fact that they cut Harry's rage out scene from the end of OOTP, where he trashes Dumbledores office. I feel like we got robbed of seeing some excellent acting from Radcliffe and Gambon. They would have killed it. Seeing Harry finally break down like that was to me, the true climax of the book. Everything builds to that moment. From the last 5 books to now, this is the moment where Harry finally snaps.  Where he can't take it anymore. It's one of the most well written scenes in the series and it breaks my heart that we didn't get to see it on screen. 

Honorable mention: The Harry/Ginny relationship. They fucked this one up real bad. 

What change or cut did the movies make that made you the most unhappy? Im starting to think HR will be the big character death this season. His character has been set up for it pretty well. He's constantly trying to find his value on the team, wishes he was like his more intelligent multiverse counter parts, and than of course, there's what Savitar said to him. I'm paraphrasing but he said ""you the coward, are the only one to survive"". I think it would be a great pay off if HR is the one to save Iris and dies in her place, thus fuffilling his character arc of wanting to be important/useful to the team and Barry. I can absolutely see him doing it, not in a ""I have to prove myself to them"" sort of way, but in a ""these are my friends and it's the right thing to do"" sort of way. Ironically and sadly, in death, he DOES prove himself and becomes the great man/hero he always dreamed of becoming and wrote about. In some ways I think so. I feel the ways of thinking that are ingrained in people by religion, and other cult like organizations such as the DNC and RNC, are flawed and dangerous. I call it faith based thinking. To trust in a ""higher"" or ""other"" power, without questioning it or looking at why you would do so logically.  This is what leads to Dictatorships. This is why the common people were not allowed to read the Bible back in the day, because knowledge and truth is the enemy of those who seek to rule over others. Just some thoughts! What do you guys think? I absolutely love Sagara as Adrian Chase/Prometheus. But can you imagine some of his most epic scenes if he had turned out to be Tommy? Hey may have used a stolen tech that allows him to change his face similar to HR. During the episode when Prometheus captures Ollie, just imagine Tommy saying ""confess your secret Oliver"" , ""you don't kill because you have to so why? Why Oliver, why do you do it?"", And ""I know Oliver, I just don't care."" Imagine him smiling as Oliver confesses he enjoys killing. Would have been pretty badass. The time is right. I feel a really good Potter game could sell really well. Some of my ideas on what id like to see are

1. A first person Skyrim type open world game that takes us through the 8 books 
2. Give Nintendo the license to adapt each book into a video game, as they originally wanted to in the 90s. I feel a Nintendo HP game could be really unique and interesting. "

And most of the time nobody can even see what you're doing anyway, even if you don't have tinted windows.

azriel777,5,10,"Lets be honest, kingspray was one of the titles that everyone was getting excited for, now all of a sudden they change their release date and are silent.  Seems pretty obvious what happened and I am really bummed because I was so looking forward to it.

On a side note, I wonder if this is desperation on oculus/facebook part.  It seems pretty clear devs and consumers overwhelmingly prefer the vive and oculus/facebook have resorted to bribery to keep from going under.  I was fine with oculus being around doing their own thing, but after this bullshit I hope the company goes under.
Was watching Severance and just really like the weird and eerie feeling the luman corporation has, almost a subtle Lovecraftian mystery feel on how you know something really messed up is going on, but how most of the people just accept it and turn a blind eye to it.  Is there anything that is similar?  Looking for something with a more horror and serious angle, so something like The Atrocity Archives does not fit since it is more of a comedy in which the horror elements are defanged by the humor in it.While I would rather have a skyrim VR, I will take what I can get.

It's really minor, but I just kinda expected it to go as usual. She's dead, you say ""Grelod the Kind is dead"" as usual, but I was pleasantly surprised hearing a small bit of dialogue I've never heard in the five years of playing and countless times completing that quest.Boots, like on the legacy outfits and the Sekhmet costume, sound heavy and click on stone surfaces.

[YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp3-KQ922RELlU_q8bmxEMtweK_b8jo0j)

[Steam Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785603956)

In honor of the three-year anniversary of the events of Episode 1, I have finally finished and released the Life Is Strange Complete Soundtrack on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp3-KQ922RELlU_q8bmxEMtweK_b8jo0j). In this post, I will explain how music works in certain scenes.

This project began when I downloaded Człowiek Drzewo’s soundtrack. In his version, he labels each instrumental track as “Track 1,” “Track 2,” and so on, so I tried to label each instrumental track based on when it played in the game. The project quickly grew when it became apparent that there were still some pieces of music in the game not present in his version.

**What this soundtrack includes**

This soundtrack has every piece of music that plays during the main game in order of appearance, resulting in 142 tracks and 5 hours and 57 minutes of music. This includes both instrumental tracks composed by Jonathan Morali and licensed music by various artists. In turn, there are two types of licensed tracks: those from [Audio Network](https://us.audionetwork.com/) and those that are not. Audio Network tracks are usually less prominent and not in cutscenes, such as the music Dana plays in her room, music at the Two Whales, and most of the music from the Vortex Club party. Licensed tracks not from Audio Network are almost always used in cutscenes and were officially released outside of *Life Is Strange*. These tracks were also included in the *Life Is Strange Official Soundtrack*, and in some cases, were shortened in the game. For these, I have included both the original version of the track and the edited version that appears in the game. The official soundtrack only includes the original versions.

Additionally, when possible I have included the lyrics with songs in their metadata. I do not guarantee they are 100% accurate, especially in the case of difficult songs to transcribe like “Got Well Soon.” Also, not all of the songs from Audio Network have lyrics online and transcribing those lyrics would be labor intensive and delay the release of the soundtrack. If anyone is interested in lyric transcription, contact me and I will gladly include your lyrics and give you credit.

**What this soundtrack DOES NOT include**

This soundtrack does not include any music from trailers, teasers, or the recaps that play at the beginning of Episodes 2 - 5 unless that music is also present in the game itself. As I recall, only the teaser for Episode 4 has music (“Got Well Soon”) and the recaps plays “Max & Chloe.” It also does not include the instrumental tracks from the official soundtrack, as many of those are slightly different than the music that plays in the game. For example, “Kate” from the official soundtrack has a slightly different arrangement on the official soundtrack. While I do want this soundtrack to be as exhaustive as possible with regard to the original game, I also do not wish to compete with the official soundtrack release, which is why I decided not to include the instrumental tracks from the official soundtrack unless they are the same as what plays in the game.

As for audio in the game itself, obviously this does not include dialogue or sound effects, with just a few exceptions that I will note in the track listing. I did not include what plays when Max focuses on a photo, as the game considers it a sound effect. Additionally, there are four appearances of music in the game that I do not include. The first is on the main campus in Episode 1, where Justin and the other skaters play their own music in addition to the non-diegetic background music. I do not know the source of this music. I also do not include music in the hallway of Blackwell in Episode 2. There, Luke plays two songs on his phone ([“Cool Power” by Darren Leigh Purkiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDi7KZQVJfk) and [“Storm Warning” by David O’Brien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wandUHENg2s)), and an unknown girl plays music near the bathroom. I do not know the names of these songs, but presumably they are also from the audio network. Next, when Max first arrives in the alternative timeline at the end of Episode 3 and is sitting with members of the Vortex Club there is a light background beat. No idea where this is from. Finally, Max can hear music from Evan’s room in the boy’s dorms in Episode 4 ([“Drifting By” by Richard Lacy and Sarah Elizabeth Lacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E7YZBfrQ6c)).

In all these cases I decided the music was too faint and not distinct enough to be worth including and was better classified as part of the background sound effects.


**Audio Sources**

The tracks come from four primary sources. Most of the tracks are audio rips using [audio ripping tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3qnjpg/ep5_spoilers_release_life_is_strange_complete/) made by /u/RenegadeWade on reddit. Some are renamed tracks from Człowiek Drzewo’s soundtrack. The original versions of the licensed tracks are from the official soundtrack. Finally, if I could not find the music in the audio rips, I recorded the music directly using Audacity and turning off dialogue and sound effects in the game’s audio settings.

**How Music Works**

Music in Life is Strange is controlled by triggers, meaning when an event occurs the game will play a music track or multiple tracks. In many cases the trigger is the beginning of the scene, but in some cases it can be caused by a change in the scene as triggered by the player. For example, when Max goes downstairs for breakfast in the Price household in Episode 3 there is no music track playing. When she talks to Joyce however, “Golden Hour Breakfast” (track 75) will play. In the track list and the comments metadata for each file, I have noted every trigger for each music track.
Also, the game plays music two ways: on loop and finite. “Max & Chloe” (track 25) plays on loop when Max and Chloe first ride in the truck in Episode 1, meaning once it reaches the end of the track, it will start playing from 1:20 in the track until the scene ends and the music fades out. Finite tracks only play the track once and then no music plays. “Back to the Junkyard” (track 115) plays from the beginning of Max and Chloe’s return to the junkyard at night in Episode 4, but after playing for the full 52 seconds, the track ends and no more music will play until they reach Rachel’s burial place. In the track list and comments metadata, if I do not say the track plays on loop, then it is a finite track.

In addition, sometimes the game plays multiple tracks at the same time or adds a new layer of music due to a trigger. For example, when Max and Chloe break into Blackwell at night, the scene starts with “Breaking and Entering” (track 67) and will play on loop. When Max walks further into Blackwell to get bomb supplies, an extra layer of music starts playing on top of “Breaking and Entering,” together making “Night Walk” (track 68). The extra layer will fade away when Max goes back to the principal’s office. In some cases I use two files for this; in others I include both the single and double layers in the same file.

Some of the scenes in the game are too complex to fully explain in the track list or metadata, so I will explain these scenes in this post.

**Pause Menu and Max’s Diary**

There are two different tracks that play on both the Pause Menu and Max’s Diary, though they both sound very similar. The difference is their opening and the opening’s length; version 1’s opening lasts for 1:03 and version 2’s opening lasts 0:50. Both versions then start playing an identical track that loops every 1:05.

When you first open the Pause Menu or diary, the game randomly plays either version, and then alternates back and forth between the two versions as you open and close the Pause Menu or diary. In other words, if version 1 plays when you pause the first time, version 2 will play when you pause the second time, and version 1 will play again the third time.

Perhaps obviously, opening the pause menu or diary will pause the music and audio playing in the game itself and will resume right where it was stopped when you resume play.

**Blackwell Academy**

The “Main Campus” area in Episode 1 and “Dormitories” area in Episode 4 both follow unique rules for area music. “Main Campus” opens with the finite track “Blackwell Academy” (track 13), which either fades out when the track ends or will fade into the loop “Blackwell Academy Fountain” (track 14) if Max sits on the fountain or under one of the trees. Once the opening track has played, after a couple minutes without music one of the four tracks I named “Blackwell Academy Main Campus” (tracks 15 – 18) will play at random. Once the track runs out it is followed again by another two minutes without music and then plays one of the four tracks. I’ve never heard the same track played twice in a row, but the order the tracks play does vary. For example, you might have track 16, then 18, then 17, then 16 again. At any time, if Max sits on the fountain or under the tree it will fade into track 14.

“Dormitories” in Episode 4 follows similar rules. It also opens with a finite track, “Return to Blackwell Academy” (track 94), and again plays track 15, 16, 17, or 18 at random after two minutes without music. It does not have a place for Max to sit that will play music.

**Max’s Room**

You have control of Max in her room four times: Episode 1, 2, 3, and 5. Episode 3’s appearance does not have any music after the opening cutscene, and Episode 5 plays “Reality Breaking Apart” (track 129). Neither scene lets you play music on her Hi-Fi or guitar, which you can do in both Episode 1 and 2. In Episode 1, Max can play “Crosses” on her Hi-Fi, and she will play a solo version of “Crosses” on her guitar. If the song is playing on the Hi-Fi, she will sync her performance to the song. Episode 2 opens with “Something Good” playing in Max’s room, which she can either turn off or will just stop playing after enough time passes. She can then turn it back on. She plays a solo guitar version of “Something Good,” which she will sync to the song if it’s playing.

**Dana’s Room**

Dana will play music in her room in Episode 2. She plays three songs from the Audio Network. Dana turns the music off if Max starts to talk to her. The three songs initially play in this order:

1. What a Day
2. Naughty
3. Save the World

Then, the songs go back up the list, so “Naughty” plays again followed by “What a Day.” Then it goes back down the list again. In other words, the loop continuously goes up and down the list, meaning “Naughty” plays a lot more often than the other too songs if you bother to stand around in Dana’s room for a really long time.

**Chloe’s Room**

Aside from the alternate timeline, Max visits Chloe’s room four times, once in Episodes 1 and 3 and twice in Episode 4. Two songs play on Chloe’s Hi-Fi in Episode 1: “Santa Monica Dream” and “Piano Fire.” Aside from putting in the CD that plays “Santa Monica Dream,” Max does not have control over when the songs play, unlike in later episodes. In Episode 3, Max can play a song on the Hi-Fi once “Lua” finishes playing. At that point, she can choose between Angus & Julia Stone (“Santa Monica Dream”), Sparklehorse (“Piano Fire”), and Bright Eyes (“Lua”). Once that song finishes playing, she can choose to play another song. Episode 4 introduces a fourth song in Chloe’s room, “In My Mind,” when Max returns to the original timeline. This first time in Chloe’s room in Episode 4, she is unable to play further songs on the Hi-Fi once it finishes playing. When Max and Chloe return to her room to complete their investigation, Max can play any one of those four songs that have previously played in Chloe’s room. Once again, she can choose another song once it finishes playing.

**Vortex Club End of the World Party**

The party scene begins outside with a muffled version of the entrance music, which I called “Outside the Vortex Club Party” (track 101). This plays during a finite cutscene, and plays again, this time on loop, in Episode 5 when Max uses Warren’s photo to go back to warn Chloe. It then plays on full volume on loop in the party lobby in “Vortex Club Party Entrance” (track 102). The last ten seconds or so of this track play when Max walks into the main party area, which will cause the game to crossfade into “Got Well Soon.”

The music in the main party area consists of the following ten tracks in this order:

•	Got Well Soon

•	Bamalam

•	Make the Call

•	Hot In There

•	NRG Flex

•	All Eyes On Me

•	All Wrong

•	Check ‘Em Out

•	Bang Tidy

•	Byte Me

Except for “Got Well Soon,” all of these tracks are from Audio Network. Each track transitions into the next, much like a real DJ would. For example, the last 17 seconds or so of “Bamalam” (track 105) include sampled audio from “Make the Call” (track 105). As a result, the division between some of the tracks is fairly arbitrary, and the game itself places them together in one track. Most releases of the party music that I’ve seen release them this way, but I decided to make them separate in order to make the name of each track and the artists clear. To make the transitions between tracks seamless, I recommend playing them in a medium that does not have a break between tracks. This is why I decided to combine them in my YouTube playlist.

Also, the music will also become quieter if Max goes into the locker room and become louder when she goes back out into the pool area.

Because “Got Well Soon” is the only track released on a separate album, I include the original album version (track 103) without the DJ transition. In most cases I put the Life Is Strange version first, followed by the original. In this case, I place the original first so that the in-game version (track 104) can transition into “Bamalam.”

Finally, a muffled snippet of ""Make the Call"" plays during the cutscene when Max and Chloe leave the party and get a text from “Nathan.” I include this as “Leaving the Party” (track 114).

**Credits**

The first half of the credits track is identical to the original Max & Chloe track in Episode 1 (track 25), except for a slight hum at the beginning from ""Golden Hour."" It’s possible the game tries to load the menu before loading the credits at the end of each episode. While it might be an error, I decided to include it as it is what plays in the game. The second half is a loop that differs in length for each episode’s credits. The version I use is from Episode 5. I also use ""artistic license"" in the track’s conclusion, as the version in game merely fades out abruptly at the end. Because this is the final track, I wanted the ending to be a bit more substantial, so I used a volume drop in the last few seconds followed by a fade out. This was heavily inspired by the conclusion to the credits track in Człowiek Drzewo’s soundtrack, though my version has a slightly longer fade out.
Here is the length of each episode’s credits:

•	Episode 1: 7:21

•	Episode 2: 6:33

•	Episode 3: 6:51

•	Episode 4: 6:36

•	Episode 5: 7:10

**Rewinding**

Music does not play during rewinds (with one exception). All the audio during a rewind is sound effects.

I did not test this exhaustively, but almost everywhere I tried handles music the same way when Max rewinds. The music simply mutes while Max is rewinding; the music does not rewind along with Max. This is true for both diegetic and non-diegetic music. For example, if “In My Mind” has played for exactly 30 seconds and Max rewinds for 5 seconds, the song will resume at 35 seconds, not 25 or 30 seconds. This may not make a whole lot of narrative sense for diegetic music, but it was presumably easier for Dontnod to program.

There are two exceptions that I know of. When Max saves Chloe from the train, the track “Timeless” plays (track 55), which is 1:30 long, the exact amount of time Max has to save Chloe without rewinding. (Side note: it is possible to do so if you do everything right, which I learned from frequent audio testing). Rewinding during this scene will also rewind the music, so if the track has played for 30 seconds and Max rewinds for five seconds, it will resume playing at 25 seconds.

The other exception is during the nightmare: “uoy fo lla oT” (track 136). Here, when Max rewinds the track becomes “To all of you” (track 3) during the rewind, then reverses itself again when the rewind ends. “uoy fo lla oT” begins at the end of “To all of you,” so Max rewinding at 30 seconds into “uoy fo lla oT” plays “To all of you” at 3 minutes. If she rewinds for five seconds then, “uoy fo lla oT” resumes at 25 seconds.

Zeus: 2A while ago, I tried to play a Neverwinter Nights 2 campaign called Baldur's Gate Reloaded. It... didn't quite work right. SO I waited until now to try again after hearing about a couple of mods for this modded campaign to make it work more the way I wanted it to work. I played through on the ""hardcore D&D"" difficulty, which is comparable to ""Core Rules"" in Baldur's Gate--no mercy for potion drinking, moving in combat, casting AoEs over your party, etc.

To put it short, Baldur's Gate Reloaded is a bizarre mess. It's a ton of fun still, because it's Neverwinter Nights 2, but it's a mess. I'll start with the items: there are Baldur's Gate copies of 90% of the base items in the game. Why? Why do there need to be two different longsword items used? Or shortsword? Or arrows? It's jarring, to say the least. Some of them are different prices too! I get the feeling that the original intent of this mod was to make NWN2 use a modified 2E-D&D ruleset instead of its 3.5E version, which would be too ambitious for basically any modder on the planet.

Another strange feature of this campaign is the large amount of extra custom content packaged with it. It's about what you'd expect from a big bundle of features: some is cool, some is redundant, some is questionably balanced--and each of these factors are, of course, doubled, since we are working with D&D 3.5 materials. The Thug class, for instance, is a Fighter-type that gets sneak attack dice instead of extra feats. Cool, although it's definitely treading on the multiclass fighter/rogue territory. Giving most non-spellcasting classes Tumble as a class skill also is in the cool-but-questionable balance territory, but since the game's movement detection and attack of opportunuity system is so borked, I'll accept it. They also dug up a ton of spells from the deepest splatbooks, like a Druid spell which is basically Scorching Ray but piercing damage. Why? Who thought Druids needed another spell that does basically the same things as Sorc/Wiz, in a game where Call Lightning is basically ""fireball on my feet but don't hurt my allies""? Also Druids get Glitterdust here. Glitterdust is especially a complaint of mine since it was buggy. The targeting indicator was made extremely small, but it has a massive area! This looks like another weird ""we want Baldur's Gate with 3D graphics"" element, where the mod direction left out the spell AoE graphic so that you would have to eyeball it. Then there are the wands. They all seem to be set to 99 charges. This is ridiculous. I don't want the temptation to use a 99 charge 8d6 cold ray wand, for instance.

BGR also gets some things just plain *wrong.* Xan, for instance, is marked as an Illusionist, whose chosen deity is not an Elven one. A lot of characters' ability scores did not translate directly, but that might be understandable given the difference in meaning between D&D editions. I am pretty upset that Kagain doesn't have his 20 CON though. Several item descriptions, copied from default NWN2 items, are not updated to reflect what they do now. I have seen two different potions called ""Potion of Frost Giant Strength"" with different graphics and implied different effects (I haven't checked if they are different). Ettercaps are possibly the most egregious example though: they use a copy of the Umber Hulk model, which I do not mind since making models can be time-consuming, but they STILL HAVE THE UMBER HULK CONFUSION GAZE ATTACK. I don't even know if they poison. Also, Lucky Aello's shop is a generic weapon store instead of the local cursed item dispensary--bigly missed opportunity IMO.

Then, there is the difficulty. I am not against playing a difficult campaign. I am, however, against some of the places where difficulty has been injected.

This is a difficult fight naturally, though doable at a low level, but now it's a nightmare since you can't maneuver the party around--there are no formations in NWN2, nor ability to arrange your party order, so good luck if the game decides Imoen is going to stand at the front of your team!
* Hobgoblins hit like they have 18 strength or higher. They are absolutely brutal.
* In the Bear River zone (the place with the paladin trying to kill Gibberlings, and the passive Ogre that I affectionately call Shrek), the Bear that you have to kill for a quest does not appear until you talk to the quest-giver. Unfortunately for me, it spawned right on top of Xan and killed him. I loathe teleporting/spawning-on-top-of-you enemies, and believe this design choice should be avoided at all costs when it could put monsters on top of a party. It's a BEAR, not a NINJA. It isn't going to sneak into the middle of my party to attack. This isn't really difficulty but I needed to complain.
* The Spider Lair in Cloakwood features not just a mix of blade spiders (used instead of sword spiders), giant spiders, and Etterhulks. Oh, also, Centeol is a Hag now. I don't mind Centeol being capable of contributing to the battle somehow. I DO mind that she is a tanky bitch with insane damage reduction, such that I can only hurt her because of Inspire Courage giving extra magic damage on attacks! ALSO, as if an indestructible boss that holds all of the treasure personally wasn't enough, the fight spawns TWENTY MINI-SPIDERS. You cannot move in this area. If you do not have a discriminate AoE damage spell, these spiderlings will drive you insane. I bugged this fight out since I broke the dialogue introduction (probably only possible because I modded the dialogue system to not be cutscene-style with no time given to the long sections) and attacked Centeol directly, skipping the spider spawning. This is the part where I decided that any fight that annoyed me too much would warrant unloading the 99-charge wands. Addendum: some idiot put a ton of spider webs on the ceiling of this room, meaning if you don't position the camera in delicate spots or use behind-the-shoulders control, all you get is visual distraction.
* Cloakwood doesn't stop at the spiders, since the Wyverns used are bullshit. The Fortitude save DC for their poison is 26--I checked my Monster Manual, and that one lists it as being 17. This is a massive difference, since failing the save for this poison drops your constitution by so much you are basically dead. For reference, I am running a Barbarian/Druid with 18 CON, and my saving throw for Fortitude is +13. This means I only have 50% chance to pass. Short of obscene cheese, you WON'T get anything better than that.
* I later discovered that Baby Wyverns also force the DC 26 fortitude saves. This feels like poor proofreading.
* In a lot of fights where you are protecting an NPC, they assist you in the battle. Great! It often didn't make sense that they weren't willing to fight for their lives. However, they are still often way out of their league, and the enemies like to target them first.
* Bentha, the ""witch"" at the Nashkel Carnival, dies extremely fast, leaving you to deal with a Stoneskinned Wizard chucking fireballs (a bunch of spells that Zordral never cast in vanilla!) and no quest reward.
* Aldeth Sashenstar, the nobleman with a hunting cabin in Cloakwood, stands no chance against a Druid throwing around Call Lightning Storm and a bunch of other AoEs (with Stoneskin, naturally.) He doesn't know how to run away in the middle of a spellcast to save his own skin. I can't see a way to save him unless your whole party takes the Knockdown feat and you fish for good RNG. I didn't try this battle from the other side, but I imagine it's hilariously easy with a high-level 3.5 druid on your side! (side note: Sashenstar didn't seem to have his personal retinue with him. That said, they would all probably die in one blast from the Lightning Storm.)

Surprisingly, so many of my gripes with the mod ended when I reached the city itself! The main issue at that point was the loading time, since the module for the city was 206-ish zones. On a modern computer, it's not a big deal. At this point, my characters were strong enough to take care of themselves, and the challenges in the city didn't have schizo-difficulty. I should note that I did find a weird item in a shop which was hilariously expensive and also hilariously worth it. That, and the fact that Lucky Aello's shop isn't full of cursed garbage, were probably the only disloyal things I have to say about the game. I particularly enjoyed a moment when a large amount of spiders and ghasts in the sewers all barreled down the same hallway! One bug did hurt me a lot though: at the end of the Ducal Palace scene, an Acid Arrow I fired right at the end never stopped ticking on a ""Someone"" character, which made it impossible to rest. I also felt that semi- and final battles were of appropriate difficulty, and I don't think I was overleveled; my party was a mix of level 8 & 9. I *did* have a veritable hoard of random buff items and scrolls that I needed, but who doesn't do that? It was a tough battle at first but quickly became Sarevok's certain doom. Then, when the deed was done, I received a new background feat called ""Child of Bhaal"" and the game crashed.

In case you are curious, my final party was CHARGNOME (Barb 4/ Druid 5), Imoen (Rogue 6/Swsh 3), Xan (Wiz 9), Garrick (Bard 9), Ajantis (Pala 8), and Yeslick (Cleric 8). I don't recommend doing that multiclass since I forgot that wild shaping can deduct from an obscenely high CON score, although it was fun at the start. I would also like to note that there was a very high party member body count, and this group was short on durable characters for a while.

I have no knowledge of the TotSC content, since it either doesn't exist or I just forgot to install it.

Final recommendation: if you want to mix up your usual experience with Baldur's Gate by changing the game, it can be fun. The early game is even more hellish than normal, and the city section is comparably very short. If you want to pick up Neverwinter Nights 2 to experience this mod, I would consider the acquisition worth it just for the short-but-sweet Mask of the Betrayer campaign. The vanilla campaign is fun but long and by no means a masterpiece, and Storm of Zehir is an oddity with some high points. If you already have Neverwinter Nights 2, don't hate it, and you don't hate Baldur's Gate (a trait that I assume is consistent with everyone reading here...), find the time for it! It takes a can-do, ready-for-any-bullshit attitude, but again, I'd be surprised if anyone here hasn't put that on before. Also consider that the team is mostly done with their sequel, Shadows of Amn: Reloaded!

TL;DR the mod starts out jank, stays jank, but NWN2 is already fun. The city and onward is a great experience, and there is a sequel in the works.Before I finished all of these campaigns, I got the stupendous idea to write down my reflections on missions that stood out to me whether for their elegance, their frustration factor, or sometimes their cheesability. Some of these were written months after the relevant mission, but some were written directly after I escaped from another layer of the abyss.

Joan of Arc 3: After I landed my base on top of Burgundy, I built up 30 petards to oneshot 3 castles at the same time, thus avoiding Fastolf's charge. Usually whenever I could, I would drop my starting base on top of an enemy to neutralize them, a strategy which worked much better in the AoK/AoC campaigns than the Age of Spam ones.

Barbarossa 4: Notable because when I took the achievement for not using villagers, I didn't know about the sneak/rush strat so I made the whole thing take 2 hours.

Attila the Hun 6: your starting army is strong enough to tear apart Mediolanum (green) if you maneauver around the Paladins well. You don't even need to set foot in the city to take it down with your Trebs, which will save you from the trigger that starts Verona's wonder (a fact I didn't know on my first attempt, so I had a panicky 4-year time left on the clock). Also, for some reason Rome is marked Italian and not Byzantine, so you can recruit Condottieros on this mission. They have some use when attacking Aquileia (red) because they beat Halberds and have enough health to survive a few hits from the enemy scorpions.

Montezuma 4: I don't know if I did something horribly wrong, or if I was just late arriving to the enemy base, but this map stalled me hard because I had to convert loads of Spanish ships to buffer against the loads-more Spanish ships constantly spawning on both sides of the bridge, before I got ANY villagers. This was the first mission that made me push myself to complete it.

Saladin 6: this is one of the classic missions that has a difficult reputation, but I decided that defense is boring and offense is fast, so I marched up the coast with my cannons and mamelukes and tore apart the bases north->east. Your starting army is pretty potent, and the mix of mamelukes and cavalry archers will rip apart anything in smaller numbers.

Vlad Dracula 2: this mission wasn't difficult, but rather than let myself be frustrated by the zoning system on this map, I spammed monks and towers as the core of my army since monasteries had unrestricted construction.

Vlad Dracula 3: I started by bringing my army + the bonus cannons to yellow's base and tearing him apart, before I even started my own base. After that I had to migrate my base off of the cliff because cannon galleons are hard to fight, but it beat trying to play a fair 5v1 :P

Alaric 5: Since I foolishly trusted the game's hints that I needed to develop my position before going on the offensive, I didn't know that the best way to start is by killing Sarus in his own base. Instead, I set up a town center on the starting island and watched all of the enemy soldiers jam up on the west side of the river while I researched champion and heavy scorpion, then used market to get a castle and treb down Sarus's base. I also had to run a large navy to keep red out of my hair. This mission was stressful even when I 100% cheesed it.

Pachacuti 2: I don't think any campaign has made me angrier than Pachacuti's, although Tariq did his best. This mission was probably the most difficult to figure out. I started by dropping my army on the Cana village (orange) and defending them as long as possible while hard-booming (zzzz). I transitioned to a defense of Scorpions, Redemption Monks, and... Pikemen? Really all I needed was a unit to buffer against eagles and crunch rams, and Villagers are hard to control in that regard. I would have used Kamayuks if gold was not extremely tight on this map. I also discovered that securing the western-most bridge with towers keeps basically all of the raiders out since there is no siege workshop on the camp that feeds to there. All in all, making me defend 2 measly villagers (I blocked them in with a house, I think it helps a little) while they construct a wonder and THEN waiting through the countdown was very exhausting. I actually skipped this one so I could clear the next mission in the campaign, since it also has a... reputation.

Bari 4: Well-Laid Plans. I think the difficulty of this mission is overstated even if it is still tricky. I used the mysteriously-available Elite Cannon Galleon to bring down both Datus's Tower (orange) and then afterwards Capua's (blue) castle, and I quickly recruited the Norman Mercenaries (yellow) to help tackle the orange army. In a normal mission, eliminating two threats and making two allies would be the turning point, but this was just the first 15 minutes. The Holy Romans (red) still start in the Imperial Age, and persistently send cavaliers, teutonic knights, and trebuchets at you. Not very easy to stop. I sent my scout to harass their first attack and kite it into the western corner of the map, and then used that time to build a wall in front of my castle. Getting started was difficult because of the high cost of recruiting the Normans. I think I used a small stack of Cataphracts to bash trebuchets and a big stack of archers jumping in and out of the castle to pick off soldiers. Once you mine out the stone pile indicating an avalanche, the two main enemies will slow down, giving you plenty of time to wait out the victory countdown or crush them.

Tariq ibn Ziyad 1: this campaign was the first one I tried out in African Kingdoms. The first mission made me cry. This campaign should not be marked as easy. This campaign should not be marked as medium. The whole thing is torture. I recommend ignoring water and mass-producing rams until you can crush the Visigoth (cyan) castles. I eventually had to use a chain of castles to break into Cordoba's (pink) inner sanctum. Fire towers suck.

Tariq 2: Also a shitshow of a mission, but luckily you (very infrequently, and after a delay) get trebuchets, so the fire towers are not as big of an issue. This was around the point where I strongly questioned the tactical reason for bringing an army of 90% camel riders against huskarls. I had to use the trebuchets from Musa's reinforcements to finally finish off Talavera (pink) since a mix of fire tower and mangonel spam made me want to pull my hair out.

Tariq 4: I have no clue why this campaign is so brutal, but this mission really isn't that bad since you can move as slowly as you like. I cleared 90% of it by microing my hero unit and pulling enemy infantry into a camel archer kill zone. Boring, but very practical, since he was my only mounted soldier that could heal. Notably, you can get equipment upgrades from the eastern pass without having to move through any of the pain-zones.

Sundjata 1: many of the campaign missions are ""solved"" by building a castle and laughing at the fools who rush onward. This mission is no different, being brutally difficult from the get-go with a high chance of losing your starting army through the ambushes. From there I had to pallisade from the edge of the map to the river, since the starting barricades around your base do less than nothing for you. The AI spazzed on the complete wall. I got to mine a ton of stone and drop a castle, then it was just a normal grind through a very large enemy base, except I barely had the population to run a decent army because the map caps at 75.

Sundjata 3: I don't know what I was *supposed* to do for this, but I made something work. This one dragged out for a while. I settled my base in the western corner, built a castle, Every time I tried to attack the enemy city they still had a ton of soldiers inside. I eventually ran out of gold. Gbetos ended up being the core of my army since I had nothing to do except micro the crap out of them. They were useful for breaking rams while safe underneath a castle. I don't remember how I escaped my shitty base, since infinite spam missions tend to turn into a blur the moment your army takes a major hit.

Yodit 5: I don't understand why this campaign was marked as ""hard"" when it was the easiest of African Kingdoms for me. This mission is very fun to rush down. I scouted the traders in the northeast, recruited their camel archers and saboteurs, and set up siege workshops and barracks on the east side of the city. I swung my army from the west side around to the east and used my west villagers to begin a small economy. With rams, pikemen (I don't think I even upgraded to halberd, they were mostly for making rams go faster) and Camel Archers I was able to clear most of the defenses in the city.

Gaja Madah 2: holy hell. The first phase, freeing the king, is bad enough to complete with a short timer, and random enemy units attacking your base from weird directions. It doesn't help that there are a bunch of join-on-sight buildings, villagers, and even a *VERY HIDDEN* stack of elephants that numbers higher than your starting army. The very start of the mission is a mad dash to pick up all of your joiners and set each individual villager to work, then using the sudden increase of resources given to you as gifts for finding everything. It's unnecessarily chaotic since you could also start with the increased resources, or have the elephants much closer to your start, or just start with a normal base. Additionally, the map does not end when you save the king. No. It just gets started after that. Orange sends a very large army to take down the king's castle just when you thought you could breathe, and then Blue. Oh FFS, Blue just does not. Give up. They spam units your way like there is no tomorrow. The map could have been simple and elegant and short and sweet if all you had to do was get your king out of the city, but instead you have to march him around the whole place and choke on an infinite wave of elite elephants and arbalests before you run into one more fortress.

Gajah Mada 5: I think this mission is supposed to be on a timer, but it never started counting for me. Regardless, I don't know who was the absolute fucking genius who thought you should have to push into an enemy city with a massive navy guarding one side, with infinitely-spawning enemies (I think they build up forever if you step into the city and never take over a district), without being able to build siege workshops. I would have been so much happier if I was allowed to mass up scorpions and rip through the stacks of enemies, but clearly that's too fun for the fucking Malay campaign. I heard there was an old version of the map where the enemy princes were all in the middle area instead of having ~5 scattered to each corner of the city, and that would have been a much more cohesive map idea.

Le Loi 1: OH **** OH GOD PLEASE JUST LET ME WIN. STOP RAMMING THE ALLIED CASTLES AND STOP AMBUSHING ME AAAAAAAAAH. *deep breath* This mission sucks. I don't think there is a way to play it that doesn't involve lots of stressing and suiciding your army. I ran Skirmishers and Elephants for most of the game, but even with an army composition that held 100% of my confidence I still felt like I needed two or more attacks to clear out the enemy bases in the back, and reinforcing the front was very difficult with large enemy patrols moving along the road-lines or constantly streaming into the enemy castles. Missions like this one make me question my decision to clear all campaigns on hard, but at least Le Loi 2 was pretty fun and returned a shred of my sanity. This is a candidate for the hardest campaign mission--Bari 4 and Prithviraj 4 have nothing on the constant attack on your very psyche provided here.

Le Loi 3: You are supposed to play this map by circling with your limited army, picking up reinforcements until you reach the mountain base in the north and starting your economy. I didn't feel like doing that. The Ming (blue) do not research their Castle Age upgrades until you (a) enter their city, or (b) reach the mountain. If you use a scout to dodge-tank the southern castle, you can break in with the ram you obtain halfway through the mission, and then knock out the castle. Then, if you are lucky, you can run in with your whole army and villagers and knock out the other target castle just before they all die. Stash one lousy soldier in a transport and run to the mountain bearing good news!

Ivaylo 3: OUCH. I could not imagine another method to complete this mission besides building a double-Krepost death zone at the front of my base. I had to spam-sell wood at the start because you get far more of it than you need, but the Market is at the front of your base so it goes down very fast. I built an army of Cavalry Archers literally only to fill up my Kreposts, and through trial-and-error, I found the right times and locations to assassinate the enemy Khans. It's a brutal mission, and if I had tried it any earlier than this very week I probably would have thrown up my hands and given up; it really helped my enjoyment of the campaign that the next mission was very relaxed.

Dos Pilas battle: this was the first Historical battle I tried. Many tears were shed in figuring it out. My winning strategy was to turtle inside of the village for as long as I could, grabbing every single upgrade before deleting all defenses and vacating to take control of the neighbor city, Uaxactun (blue). I let Naranjo (red) fall since defending it was too much of a pain, and focused on massing a large enough army that Calakmul (magenta) couldn't wipe it all. The constant attacks from Calakmul while Tikal sent basically no help made this scenario unnecessarily aggravating. Bonus points: Tikal and Calakmul are both gigantic cities, so no matter who you side against, the map will take a long time between when you secure your win and when you actually complete it.

Honfoglalás battle: I immediately scouted as many sheep as I could before trashing Great Moravia's (yellow) villager population and smashing their town centers. Then I trampled the Avars (orange) and set up a TC inside of their old base, and mined as much stone as I could so I could drop a castle between me and East Francia (red), then I watched the bodycount rise. I ignored the Bulgars since I didn't need the bounty on them.

Lake Poyang battle: even though there is an achievement for purchasing a lot of Dragon Ships, I found them mostly useless since the enemy has endless demolition ships. That gold was much better-spent on bribing the pirates. I also recommend developing a weak defense position against the Han Army (grey)--it's not worth fighting them over anything, but there are resources between your bases that you will most likely need. Also make sure to start the game with a boom and cram as many Docks as you can into your harbor, since you need high production to handle the turnover your enemy will inflict upon you. The final stage of the mission will have a lot of things attack you, so before the last shipment lands, move as many villagers as possible to construct the towers around your Temple of Heaven, then construct it as fast as possible.

Favorite campaigns: Prithviraj, Alaric, Saladin (except mission 2), Yodit, Francisco de Almeida, Bari, Bayinnaung, Ivaylo. These campaigns usually had diverse objectives and/or let you play to your civilization's strengths well.

Least-favorite campaigns: Joan of Arc (longbow kiting and ramming castles are not fun), Montezuma, Tariq, Pachacuti, Suryavarman I, Gajah Mada, Gajah Mada (so bad it deserves two mentions)

I really enjoyed maps that let me start running from the get-go, not necessarily because of large resource piles but when my starting army is actually worth something. In that regard, Sundjata 5, Joan of Arc 4, Tamerlane 5 & 6, and Kotyan 2 stood out in campaigns I was otherwise negative or neutral about.

For the record, I also have almost all of the achievements, but I wanted to get Sushi Lover last, didn't feel like finishing Kaboom just yet, and Masterpiece is either very buggy or needs a better tooltip.Two rules: everyone is Vamana, and everyone auto-buys Mystical Mail. I don't know if this is possible, but it would be hilarious.

Explanation: Vamana's ult gets a duration extension every time he takes a tick of damage. All of the Mystical Mails would do little bits of damage that would quickly convert into long ults. A bunch of giant golden babies kicking each other would be an amusing image. The mode would probably drag on way too long though.Is is possible that 1v1 Jousts could wait a little longer before trying to start a match? I wait about 30 seconds to get in, and I'm greeted with ""Game Starts in 0:05."" I find this characteristic to be the most broken part of the joust map, because it looks so easy to fix.I just realized that the S3 change to lifesteal that prevents people from healing off of overkill damage is a stealth buff for Kali. When she drops to 1hp in her ult, hunters can't sit there and sustain off of her anymore. I'm not sure how often this happened in the first place, but I'm certain there is at least one Kali player who has been cheesed out of a kill is this manner.Title. The ground target is much harder to see on this skin than Nox's base. The globe around the spot target is particles instead of translucent darkness. It's not as bad as Recon Artemis traps on the joust map, but it's still difficult to see, which is bad considering how powerful an ability it is.

Is it easier at higher graphic settings? I keep mine as low as possible to help my weak laptop handle the game."

Never will I play Hieratics with a straight face again.It should be nominated in the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" Award... as in ""5 More Minutes"" of maintenance. /s

In all seriousness, ""5 More Minutes"" is a good nomination, though it probably will get beat out by the Civilization series.So I decided to build a fun and trolly deck: http://devcat.nexon.com/duel/us/deck?5f8a38e

Basically the concept is to rush to Avatar and multiply it to create an unbreakable monster wall and just win from there. So being an excited prick who's testing out a trolly deck, I hit up the Internet Duels to test this baby out. So far so good in making the successful combo, albeit the weak HP Avatars due to taking too much face damage, the opposing player plays his Phantom of the Dragon, then Hellhound afterwards. Hilarity comes after as the game goes into a forever loop...

zedoktar,2,5,"We're playing the bloody Rickshaw! Anyone who knows Vancouver knows what that means. I've seen so many legendary shows here and now I'm part of that legacy! 

We're not metal or punk perse but we've been called Viking folk punk. We prefer Viking Power Folk. Bands called Wolfbrood if anyone wants to look us up. Not sure on what counts as promotion so I'll leave it at that. 

We've been a band since October. Our leader has been developing most of the music for years. Prior to this I was a dork playing with myself at home doing youtube covers, and I played in one super casual band with my BFFs that barely ever made it out of their livingroom.


I joined this band on a fluke in October because my friend was looking for session musicians for a bday show for Chi Pig of SNFU. I thought it'd be like one and done.


6 months later we're on stage at the bloody Rickshaw. I'm still waiting to wake up and it all have been a cheese induced dream."
JLR-,5,8,"It was just a typical day on the green side doing my usual Sick Bay duty in the morning.  Nothing serious other than a few headaches easily cured with some meds and a few blister kits given out as well. 

Then this one Marine (Private) comes in who I shall call ""Alabama"" as he was from there and a tad bit on the slow side but a nice guy from what I knew of him.  He stood about 6foot and was on the husky side. He had brown hair and his yellow teeth would show when he smiled.  So Alabama comes in and was complaining of a sore throat.  In one hand he had his trusty spitoon as he loved his chewing tobacco.     

""Devildoc"" he said. *spit* ""My throat be hurting me""  *spit*.   I looked at his throat and did not see anything major.  I told Alabama to hang tight and he said ""Sure thing devildoc""  *spit*. 

I told Alabama to stop with the spitting and put that damn thing away as he can wait until he leaves my sick bay to chew his tobacco and it's a fucking nasty habit.   ""Sure thing devildoc"" *spit*   DAMN IT Alabama I said put that away!     

I leave/turn my back to get my penlight and some paperwork and when I return I grab my can of coke on my desk and take a huge gulp of it. 

I recoiled in disgust and gagged and looked down at my desk/table and noticed there was another Coke can on there.  My mind raced as if there was 2 cans on my desk then this can must have been....  

ALABAMA!!!    

Sure enough Alabama had put his Coke can/spitoon on my desk right next to my real can of Coke.  

I spat out the foul liquid and I about lost it. I told Alabama to get the fuck out of my sick bay.  ""What about my throat?"" asked Alabama.   I threw some throat lozenges at him and said ""GET OUT!""         
  
He leaves in a hurry but seconds later comes back and has the nerve to ask me ""Can I have my can back devildoc?""   ""Fuck no Alabama!  GET OUT!""      

I then proceeded to rinse my mouth out for the rest of the morning and cursing Private Alabama under my breath.   

And this is why I can't drink Coke from a can to this day.  

I was on my to work at the base hospital (Corpsman) on the green side.  About one and half km away from the hospital I see a Marine in PT gear running quite slowly (not that unusual as many would do morning PT on their own) and then fall to one knee (very unusual!).  

I pull over and ask the Marine if he needs help.  He looked at me and snarled ""I don't need your help devildoc carry on"".  I glanced down at his leg and noticed a red mark with two puncture wounds.  

He admitted he could have been bit by a poisonous snake (lots of rattlesnakes and other poisonous snakes on base) but was adamant he is fine.  I take his vitals and his heart rate is through the roof.  I tell him calmly ""You really need to get in my car so I get you to the hospital"".  He raised his voice and shouted ""I CAN MAKE IT TO THE HOSPITAL ON MY OWN!""   I shout back ""NO YOU WON'T!  THE MORE YOU RUN THE FASTER YOU'LL DIE!  GET IN THE FUCKING CAR NOW!""     

You'd think that would have been the end of it but nope.  He tries to pull rank on me (he was an E-6 I was an E-4).  I said ""I can call my Division Officer and he can order you to get in the god damn car or you can get the fuck in the car and use some common sense""  

He complies and I speed off to the hospital.  Since I had no time to find proper parking I park in the Head of Radiology's parking spot and get him to the ER Stat.  

Luckily he gets the anti venom and lives to grumble another day.  I head to my department and my Division Officer chews me out for being late so I have to explain the entire story to him.  All was well or so I thought.  

About 30 minutes pass and I realize I left my car in the Head of Radiology parking spot!  FUCK!  I run to Radiology to explain myself before he came looking for me (My car was obvious and everyone knew it was mine) or worse he announced it on the Quarterdeck.  

As I hurry down the halls a couple of shipmates stop me and tell me I have big balls for parking in the Head of Radiology spot.  I wanted to explain myself but stopped halfway through the story and told them I had no time to talk.  I enter his department and was told he was headed to the Quarterdeck.   SHIT!  I run to the Quarterdeck cutting through other departments and see the Head of Radiology moments from announcing it on the PA system.  

""STOP!"" I shout.  ""Excuse me Petty Officer JLR?"" he said back to me.  ""umm STOP SIR""  I said.  He looked at me and said I better have a damn good reason for parking in his spot.  I said ""I have a damn good reason Sir!""  After explaining the story for the 2nd (and a half?) time today he checked with the ER and his gruff and surly demeanor stayed the same.  He hung up the phone and asked me ""So when are you going to move your damn car Petty Officer JLR?""   I said ""Right now Sir.""  He said ""Negative, Petty Officer you'll move it a week from today.  Thank you for a job well done.""   

I head back to my department and one of the HA's (E-2) said a Lt Col called for me and I need to call him back ASAP.  ""Now what?"" I thought.  I call the number and the Lt Col says his Sarge was late for muster and he heard it was my fault.  I start to explain why but he cuts me off and says ""Thanks devildoc as I'd rather have him late than dead"".  The next month I got a NAM (Navy Achievement Medal) at the base award ceremony although I felt it wasn't worthy of a NAM at the time.  Looking back maybe it was?   

tl:dr - Sarge got bit by a snake, argued with him, parked in the wrong spot, pissed off the Head of Radiology and got a medal. Being a Corpsman there were times things were slow and I also enjoyed messing with others and was known for being a joker.   

One of many jokes I would do is find some shipmate (or Marine) who just arrived at their first duty station and tell him (the females always got the joke so I never asked them anymore) that I need some red Fallopian tubes and need them as soon as possible (if it was aboard ship it made it even more amusing).     

Now most who knew me were in on the joke as they knew it was me just fucking around.  As a result the person would return with white PVC piping.  I would get annoyed and say ""Damn it, I said red!  Can't you follow simple directions Shipwreck (or Private).""  

This would go on for hours with them bringing me red straws, metal pipes...etc.   ""Damn it, these are red straws!  Who gave you these?""   ""Sorry Petty Officer, they said this was all they have""  ""Well go back and return them!""

""Damn it, these are not standard issues tubes!  Go to MWR (which was on the other side of the base) and ask for some!""   ""Yes, Petty Officer!""   

I'd get a phone call occasionally from Motor Pool or the Galley saying ""Bored again Petty Officer JLR?""  To which I said ""Yup, feel free to keep the fun going""  

Eventually, either someone let them in on the joke or I told them I was fucking with them and how the hell do they not know what a Fallopian tube was? 

Although my jokes caught up with me once as a Private asked the wrong person but it's late where I live and will write about this another time.  

       


 After reading about the guy who was hungover before a PT test it brought back a memory/story about the time me (Navy Corpsman), 2 Marines not in my unit I shall refer to them as Dude and Scar  (Scar because he had a large scar from combat and Dude because he was like ""the Dude"")  and a civilian friend of theirs went out drinking.   Did I mention they had a PT test in the morning?    

Right after work we hit up the bars so needless to say we started early.  Better yet the base/area got 59 minutes off early (the reason it was 59 minutes was that was the max allowed).  

So it wasn't even happy hour yet but the drinks started early and often.  The civilian friend they knew from somewhere but hell if I can remember.  He met up with us about an hour so later. 

As for me I would drink just enough not to get shitfaced.  I had a mild buzz going on but was OK to drive and think coherently.   My 2 friends and the tag along were plastered and the civilian kept teasing Dude & Scar how they won't be in any condition to pass the test tomorrow.  They laughed at him and joked how in boot camp there was a whole week dedicated to drinking tolerance.  The civilian looked at me to verify to which I said ""Hell if I know I'm Navy"".      

We were about three? hours into drinking and a Marine from their unit (one pay grade above them) showed up at the bar and asked them how long they have been here.  Dude said as soon as they were off duty.  He told them they have a PT test tomorrow and they better be able to pass it.  Both of them just laughed and said all is right in the world and they will pass the test.    

As it became obvious all parties (Dude and Scar) were officially shitfaced we headed back to my apartment off base.   The civilian had enough and stumbled back home (he lived near the bar).  When we got back to my place I pulled out a few IV's while the Marines were chilling on the couch.  Hooked them up and after the IV did its job we were back out drinking again in abut an hour or so.   (Don't ask how I got the IV's but rest assured I did not steal any from base)

It wasn't that late when we went back to the bar and as luck/fate would have it another Marine (same paygrade) from their unit entered the bar.  They got the same lecture about not being hungover the next day.   Dude and Scar said they would be 100% and ""with all due respect"" kick his ass tomorrow.  Then they ordered another round.  

After being shitfaced for the 2nd time it was back to my place and the IVs were hooked up once again.  By now it was getting late so we agreed to go back to the bar and only have 1 or 2 beers and call it a night as it was starting to get late.  Ok, I lied it was more of me telling them the IV treatment was over for the night.  There was no real agreement on their part.    

After one last round I drive them back to the barracks and head off home.  The next day Dude and Scar tell me how they passed the test and ""kicked ass"".   The funny part was the look on the faces of the two Marines in their unit as they said the first Marine questioned how it was possible if they had been drinking for about 3 hours nonstop after duty.   The other Marine said ""3 hours?  They were still drinking when I got there!""   Then another Marine from the barracks mentioned that they got back to the barracks around Zero dark stupid.  They compared notes I guess and could not comprehend how anyone can have that high of a tolerance and still kick ass on the test.  Scar told them his scar gives him superpowers.  Dude told them his blood was from the gods.  

Dude and Scar said the beers were on them for now on so I never paid for beers during the rest of my tour there.   I was in RTC in Great Mistakes (I mean Great Lakes).  It was week 4 and we had just finished lunch at the galley.  We were lined up across from the galley on the grinder when some flashy red sports car s..l..o..w..l..y.. cruised on by playing Boombastic. 

I somewhat got into the groove along with my friend I called Shaba (he looked like Shaba Ranks).  I blame Shaba as he was grooving first and kept saying ""Yea man, I be Mr. Fantastic"".  To be fair I didn't think it was that noticeable as I was just moving my head and shoulders and getting into the groove.  Clearly I was wrong as my RDC came storming over and shouted at the both of us. 

RDC - ""RECRUIT JLR AND RECRUIT SHABA!  WHO SAID YOU COULD DANCE?""

me - ""This recruit apologizes for dancing sir.""

Shaba ""This recruit wanted to get his groove on sir"" 

RDC - ""OH DAMN! WE GOT A COUPLE OF DANCERS HERE.  SINCE YOU TWO LIKE TO GET YOUR GROOVE ON FOLLOW ME!""

We marched back into the galley and our RDC made the following announcement:  ""RECRUIT JLR AND RECRUIT SHABA WILL DANCE FOR YOU SO YOU GET ENTERTAINMENT WHILE EATING!"" 

He played the same song and told us to dance.  I reluctantly started to move my shoulders as did Shaba.  Alas, that was not good enough for my RDC as he shouted ""OH SHIT!  I KNOW YOU CAN DO BETTER SO START DANCING!""  

I figured I better well own it so I attempted to dance but being a white boy from So. Cal it looked more like I was Vanilla Ice.  Needless to say Shaba was a far better dancer than I was.  Luckily the song was over and I thought it was the end.  

NOOOOPE!  My RDC said we can dance until the head of the galley got tired and left.  About ninety minutes later of the same song we were allowed to leave.  I figure word got out as it felt like every RDC strolled in to see us dancing and took photos.  Plus the insults and mocking and some making us sing the song while dancing.  The worst part was some RDC took video and the dancing marathon was replayed for everyone the last week of RTC.  

tldr:  RDC made me and my friend dance for everyone, I can't listen to Boombastic without getting flashbacks.  Looking back I have no regrets and would probably do it again.       "

Two of the biggest chinese development firms are trying to cash out and get out of there. Watch.

Even if you disagree with the concept of CNBC, you gotta admit it doesn't look good no matter how you look at it.

End of edit:

&#x200B;

To begin, let's start with a basic, but provable assumptions. China has extreme control over their media, similar to how north korea has control over theirs.

With this in mind, we must piece together the puzzle, to put A to B and C to D. This is basically trying to figure out how the input effects the output for a black box.

While seemingly impossible, it's a matter of seeing it as A then B then A+B formula.

&#x200B;

Let's begin, starting with The Coronavrius.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2022/01/05/beijing-is-intentionally-underreporting-chinas-covid-death-rate-part-2/?sh=2ea69f2573b8](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2022/01/05/beijing-is-intentionally-underreporting-chinas-covid-death-rate-part-2/?sh=2ea69f2573b8)

It's safe to assume that the numbers for china are not the actual numbers, as they probably have no reason to announce how much of their country died to this.

We will never know, at least until the mass gaves are dug up in fifty years by accident. EVen then, we will not know the names of those who were buried to keep a secret.

&#x200B;

this, the pandemic, alone could have triggered a internal struggle about the 'mandate of heaven'. But that's not all that's going on, for there are two more natural disasters.

&#x200B;

The locusts [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3099346/crops-risk-southern-china-battles-worst-locust-infestation](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3099346/crops-risk-southern-china-battles-worst-locust-infestation)

&#x200B;

And the famine. [https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00362-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00362-1)

&#x200B;

These two things have basically all but stripped what little agricutral production china might have,

as the locusts will eat everything and the feaver they carry will kill much of their meat production. So the populace is stuck inside or working, all while possibly starving to death in some places.

This, in addition to the fact a good chunk of the mainland is in currently in the state of becoming a 'dust bowl', means there is no food. There is only famine, and pestulance, and locusts. And amazon.

&#x200B;

That's not even the PEAK of their issues.

&#x200B;

Next, we have the power grid. With china unable to get their fill of fuel, combined with the need of manfuacturing and delivery services, their eletrical grid is starting to fall apart.

without america and austrlia to feed their turbines, they have to take extreme measures- such as cutting the fact and taking a starvation budget approach to keeping the lights on.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/chinas-coal-shortage-eases-after-beijing-steps-in-cba-report-shows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/chinas-coal-shortage-eases-after-beijing-steps-in-cba-report-shows.html)

This, combined with having to manufacture everything everyone needs during this pandemic, means that measures must be taken.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/bitcoin-btc-price-drops-on-china-crypto-mining-crackdown.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/bitcoin-btc-price-drops-on-china-crypto-mining-crackdown.html)

And that's why they've cracked down on crpytocurrency, a resource that would otherwise give them a ton of potential leverage in black markets for their fixers and operatives to get what they want.

with these things in mind, you also need to keep in mind their economic situation is one of utter shambles.

&#x200B;

Then there's the economy, the bubble that so many have speculated that would eventually pop.

&#x200B;

[https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3161717/china-gaming-crackdown-freeze-new-video-game-licences-extends-2022](https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3161717/china-gaming-crackdown-freeze-new-video-game-licences-extends-2022)

This alone, while a indicator of what's going on, isn't alone to tell us that their economy is basically falling apart.

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/10/chinas-unsold-housing-stock-hits-5-year-high](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/10/chinas-unsold-housing-stock-hits-5-year-high)

But something like this does. without the populace getting the capital, those that still have houses or property

are relying on rent and loans to get enough to keep things afloat as the enecomy all but crumbles around them,

their infrastructure fails, and their lands are hit by locusts, famine, and pox.

&#x200B;

And now, the last nail in the coffin. The thing that's been keeping the bubble afloat. The defaulted loans of Evergrande.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/business/china-evergrande-default.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/business/china-evergrande-default.html)Evergrande is trying to liquidate, shimao is trying to liquidate, sunac is trying to do a Share drive to sell it's stock off. one of the biggest privately owned banks is doing their best to proper evergrande up with a absurdly huge loan.

yet. it's barely being reported in the MSM. Are we seriously suppose to wait to hear about all this after the fact?Julian and O'Keefe have nonthing, and will have nonthing, to stop Hillary and her team. The emails are pointless and just tacky, and if they had anything to sink her, they would of used it by now.

I'll explain how the abilities would work in the comments.Let's all take a moment and remember. This is just the -preamble- to Trump's and the republican's bullshit. Remember, Trump can appoint -anyone- with very few restrictions to the supreme court, most likely because congress will just goose step with this mother fucker, either by force or choice.

You thought it was going to be bad already? just wait. Trump think's there's oil under the bottom of the barrel."

bodysnatcherz,7,9,"A year ago I got my first tattoo. It is small,[ simple, and meaningful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C5%8D). Honestly I don't get many compliments on it, but I don't mind because I'm happy with what I got.

My Nmom isn't anti-tattoo, but of course she's anti-MY tattoo. Straight away she told me she didn't care for it. The first time she saw it in person she groaned. 

Nmom is an artist so she offered to 'fix' my current tattoo by designing some things to go in/around it. 

Besides that being a terrible idea, it just says so much about her personality. Not only does she insult my tattoo, but she then decides, totally unsolicited, that she should be allowed to decide how to *permanently alter my body*. If that doesn't exemplify N behavior then I don't know what does!I remember one time in particular my mom was screaming at me for something and in a rage told me that if I didn't shape up ""I'll find somewhere else for you to live"". This wasn't a 'clean your room or we're kicking ya to the curb' type thing. This was a raging adult being totally serious.

I was a fundamentally good kid. Good grades, never in trouble. I sucked at chores and broke the rules sometimes - but what kid doesn't make those mistakes?

I was always completely terrified I would be abandoned. If my parents were furious at me they'd shut me outside (no matter the season or how I was dressed) and tell me to go away. One time I was taking a shower and when I got out the house was quiet. I started bawling because I was so sure they'd left me for good. Turns out they were just in the basement. Every time we went to the grocery store it was my job to put the cart away while my mom started the car. I would do it as quickly as possible because I was terrified she'd use the opportunity to speed away and leave me there.

It sucked to live in fear like that. Can anyone relate?For years and years, all throughout undergrad and grad school I've always been told that opportunities for physicists are boundless. We can engineer, we can code, we can problem solve. Even websites for physics organizations and university physics departments say ""Companies love to hire physicists!"". There is this idea that just because we're smart and science-minded any hiring manager will be happy to have us and will throw money at us, and we can just learn the specifics on the job.

IT. IS. A. LIE.

Companies are looking for certain majors and skills. Period. They want someone who can hit the ground running. I'm coming out of grad school being good at a bunch of stuff no one cares about, and being mediocre at skills that matter in the real world. We may be smart and have accomplished something difficult, but we just don't check the right boxes.

My advice to other grad students (especially physicists) - Look for jobs NOW. Not just an idea of a job, but find actual job listings of things you'd want to apply for. Take the requirements of job positions seriously and make sure you can hit every mark(they won't waive them for you unless you have a connection) and develop a useful skill-set.

As for me.. I'm finding my way through this mess and I'm close to getting a job. But it's tough out there.. and I wish I would have had a more realistic expectation of what employers are looking for."

dipiro,1,1,"FU because I'm going to have to buy a lot more ammo. 

I traded my beloved Glock 35 with vortex red dot sight for this hunk of commie steel: https://imgur.com/a/LoVXu

Best handgun I have ever held or fired. Best shooting that I've ever done with iron sights. Better trigger that I could have imagined. 

I enjoy collecting, customizing and shooting my glocks but shooting this is just sublime. I actually made a sad groan when I realized that I was out of ammo. 

Thanks for the recommendations you CZ fanboys.
On a certain stretch of my home trail, there are 3 big roots that run across the trail and perpendicular to it. Total distance from first to last root is probably 4 feet. 

When I first started biking in July, I’d hit these sitting down going like 3mph huffing and puffing thinking “yeah this full sus bike really makes it comfortable to ride over these”

A month later I was hitting them standing going like 6mph and thinking “yeah this full sus bike really tracks well through the bumps”

These days I carry great speed through the preceding corner, get a couple of hard pedal strokes in, hit the first one going like 10mph and jump right over the other two thinking “YEEEEEEEAAAAHHHH”

It’s super cool how I’ve ridden this trail 50+ times and it keeps getting better. It motivates me to keep trying to go faster. All of my trails around here are covered in leaves. Hitting known corners at known summer speeds leads to a lot of sliding (and some crashing). 

But when you get it right and countersteer a bit and come through it at the ragged edge of traction, it feels like such a accomplishment.

I was thinking about playing UR delver, but I’m not sure if running 1 Volcanic island and a steam vents or two would be viable. What do you guys think?So I've been playing GDS for a few weeks now and I'm tinkering with the list to see what I like best, and keeping updated on what other decks are adding/subtracting from the list. But the biggest question remains, Opt? Or Serum Visions?

They both have their upsides, Opt is instant speed and allows you to have a little bit more selection when drawing the first card. Serum Visions, although at sorcery speed allows you to dig 3 cards deep, but you don't get that immediate card selection.

I'm leaning more towards Serum Visions  as the better option as it allows you to see more cards, and allows you to scry after you draw, which has some synergy with Street Wraith. 

What are your opinions?

Also what matchups have you found to be bad matchups, and which do you think are good matchups? Most of the games I play are with my local meta and I don't get to see much variety of decks so I don't have much expirence against other ""common"" decks like Ad Naus, Scapeshift, Elves, ETC.New to the legacy format, I don't know if any local places that hold legacy tournaments, I want to practice playing in paper for GP Santa Clara. Anyone know any events happening in the legacy format?"
supersonic-turtle,2,4,"Two things, he discusses alcoholism and said some enlightening things like ""addiction replaces adventure"". Resonates with me as a recovering alcoholic.

And he says he's a fan of Gogol Bordello, I thought that was hilarious. 214 days! Thank you stop drinking and thank you to my sponsor and home group! It's not easy but it is worth it, here's to one more day![removed]With all the free time and peace of mind and body I got a second job for the heck of it. Spiritual progress is a good feeling, I haven't had to apologize for my antics or wake up feeling like death in 8 whole months!

IWNDWYT!I can't say how grateful I am to have found Jordan B. Peterson's works. Short story about me. I am a recovering alcohol and as of now it's been 342 days since my last drink. During my decade of drowning myself I lost my way in life and essentially ceased to mature. But AA and Jordan's lectures have given me the guidance I so desperately needed. 

To put it into perspective the teachings of AA are in the same vein as Peterson's.
Cleaning house, is a parallel, how can I positively affect the world around me if my life is not sorted? So that's what I have begun to do. Cleaned house, organized my possessions and mind. What are my priorities? Sobriety is number one and usefulness to my fellow man second. 

How to unclog a mind hell bent on dwelling in the negative? Treat myself as someone who is worthwhile, stop being nihilistic. The voice of doubt should have no say in my happiness and today it does not but not without constant attention and practice. 

Relationships have improved the most dramatically. I once treated people as burdens or stepping stones to something I wanted. I no longer allow myself to be this way. Give people the benefit of the doubt, cynicism while alluring and often a safe bet cannot dictate how I relate with people. Maybe just maybe ""they know something I don't"". So basically look at people as assets not liabilities. 

In summary Jordans teachings and my own AA experiences are the driving forces behind my self improvement. I dare not criticize the world as my house is not in perfect order. The basic principles between the two ideologies are very similar and work in tandem in my life. 

Anyway thanks for reading and if this isn't a post that's relevant to the discussions we have here I will gladly remove it. I just wanted to share the parallels I have found and the recent improvements I have made. 
there are many like it but this one is mine!"

[A Redditor recently wrote about their experience being aggressively pursued by a female coworker](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6vkv66/whats_the_most_sexualweird_thing_a_coworker_has/dm106vl/), and the response was overwhelmingly questioning him why he didn't go for it.  (Not that anyone should have to explain themselves in this scenario, but as it turns out, [he was technically married and getting out of an abusive relationship and was ""very much broken"" at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6vkv66/whats_the_most_sexualweird_thing_a_coworker_has/dm2aixq/)).

A selection of the responses (most of which were upvoted):

> So... did ya?

> So, how is life in the monastery?

> We're you single at the time? Was she physically attractive?

> I really don't understand why all the guys on this thread are getting so angry by these incidents. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Almost no one was angry that this happened to him.] As a guy who's been with his girlfriend for 6 years I'd be stoked if I got unsolicited nudes. 

> What's the problem? Were her eyebrows not on point?

As well as several downvoted responses asking for him to post the nudes, questioning his heterosexuality, etc.

If you feel pressured to get romantically involved with someone, know that you are perfectly free to say ""No.""  She does not need to be unattractive; you do not need to be in a relationship; you do not need to explain yourself.  Your body is your body.  If you see others put each other down like this in real life, call them out.

That is all.[The vote over not allowing witnesses and new evidence in the impeachment trial has dominated news cycles lately](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/31/us/politics/impeachment-vote.html). Are these elements of a trial that are so fundamental to the proceedings, that they should be accepted out of hand? (And/or there are other fundamental elements of a trial that were skipped that should also be deemed necessary?)

Did the framers leave [the process of the impeachment trial](https://constitutionus.com/#a1s2c5) too open-ended when they allowed for the possibility of the president being acquitted without witnesses or evidence? Are there advantages or intention behind the current vagueness of the procedures as outlined in the Constitution?

Should there be an amendment to the constitution that codifies this process and implements more standards, for example [more closely resembling criminal trial procedure](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part2/chapter223&edition=prelim)?

What are the potential downsides of this idea? EG: does this give the Chief Justice too much say in what witnesses and evidence gets allowed? Inconsistencies in going by criminal proceedings in a venue where there is no [well-defined criminal code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part1&edition=prelim)? Are there ways to address these downsides or other ways an amendment could be framed? Should increased rigor on the Senate side raise the standards of impeachment on the House side?Does Romo put up similar numbers in Payton's high-flying offense?  Do the Saints win a Super Bowl?

Where does Drew Brees end up?  Does he still emerge as an elite QB?  Does that team win any Super Bowls?  If the team is the Dolphins, who gets Dante Culpepper, and is he any good there?

And, of course, where the hell are the Cowboys now without Romo?

Sports arguments are too-often colored by a confirmation bias.  If you dig deep enough, you can always find a stat to support what you want to believe.

So let's play a game!  I have two players in my head--if this becomes a series, we can also do teams, coaches, etc.  I'll provide the topic (in this case: ""Who is the more clutch QB?""), and you provide the statistical category that you believe would best lend to the answer.

While stats can never satisfactorily declare a clear-cut winner, especially in a game like football that is so team-oriented and has such small sample sizes, our investigation will at least be falsifiable.

This game only works with minimal intervention from OP, so I will clarify a few things right off the bat:

* Since this is a comparison of individuals, I will not be comparing team achievements.  Don't bother with W-L stats.  Game-winning Drives and 4th Quarter Comebacks are more of a gray area, but I'll lean toward providing them if asked.

* Try to be as specific as possible so that you do not leave room for interpretation from OP (eg: if you're looking for a specific time period, specify which one; if you're looking for a rate stat, specify if you're looking for per attempt, per game, per season, etc). If you are not specific, I will use personal judgment (trying to be as fair as I can).  The original questioner can always correct me, though, if they had something else in mind.

* Stat organization might be a bit of a cluster-F if I don't intercede somehow.  I will try to do it in a way that makes sense without coloring the conversation.  I could (in theory) organize it by most upvoted question, though that might be tough to keep up with, and it also might not be such a pretty organization.  Open to ideas.

Let the games begin!

[1] Team points/completion is difficult to find without wading through every boxscore for the two teams from the last 5 years.  Any recommendations for how to do so more easily would be much appreciated.  Thanks!I was at a poker room the other night. The casino recently changed owners but is mostly under the same management. They just had to change out some signs and chips and everything else is humming along just fine.

The poker room manager was at my table chumming it up with the regulars (we were the highest stake game running at the time). He tells us he's got new tables coming in with 9 cupholders instead of 10. We usually use the tables for 9 players, so there's one player with the apparent indignity of having two cupholders.

I ask him what they're going to do with the old tables. He says throw them out. I half jokingly ask ""When's trash day and where are your dumpsters?"" He basically says they're going to put them through the woodchipper because of ""liability.""

I just looked around the room with my jaw agape at all 50 of the perfectly good tables, likely built by underpaid hands only for them to be destroyed splinter-by-splinter just a few years later because they have one too many cupholders."

BoyThisIsAwkward,2,5,"I have a theory about Cris Carter. 

All of this is based off the assumption that Cris has actual connections to Kawhi's camp. 

I believe that it got leaked to him the kawhi wanted to go to LAL.. [You can kind of infer that from this tweet here](https://twitter.com/ftfonfs1/status/1146397272760102912?s=21)

As we have heard, Kawhi's camp had been adamant about there not being any leaks. Leaking that Kawhi wanted to go the Lakers before his meeting with Toronto could have been seen as disrespectful to Masai. [That would explain Cris backpedaling a little. ](https://twitter.com/ftfonfs1/status/1146757149705625601?s=21) Notice how this is only one day later.  I would assume that he is saying this to help Kawhi save face AND maintain the relationship he has with his camp. This tweet alone reshaped the whole narritive from ""Kawhi to the Lakers"" to ""who knows where he's going?""

In my opinion, Kawhi already knew what Toronto had to offer before his meeting. He went anyway to be respectful. I believe if he truly wanted to stay, we'd know by now. Kawhi's reported back and forth with the Lakers is indictave of heavy interest. Rumors were saying they were working on details. The Lakers radio silence now is super encouraging now. 

TL;DR: Cris knew that Kawhi was on da way. Kawhi's camp told him to relax and make it seem like he's still deciding out of respect for the Raotors.

minnabruna,3,4,"My MIL is her 60s and recently divorced with no assets after decades of not working to raise kids and deciding not to pursue any spousal support from my FIL. She started working in a new career but then had a health issue and now she can't do that either. She has a small inheritence from her mother but that will be gone in a few years. 

My husband wanted to help, so he bought her a house. By which I mean he used money he earned before our marriage for a down payment and we pay the mortgage every month. MIL covers costs like taxes, repairs. We furnished most of it too.

It is a small house, two bedrooms, but cute and perfect for my MIL on her own.  Except she's not alone.

SIL has lived there since she finished university years ago. She majored in a field that isn't very employable and declined to do anything like internships even when specific opportunities were found and offered to her. Since graduation she hasn't worked much and never seriously tried for a full time job. She currently has a ""business"" in which she does product demos on weekends with a friend. Said friend also had a full-time job and got the main client of this business, so SIL could certainly be doing more. But she doesn't have to when her mother covers all her living costs.

BIL1 is living there too, with his fiancé. Fiancé has a full time job. BIL has a masters degree from a third-tier school in a field even less employable than SIL's. He refused for a long time to consider viable careers because he was set on a high prestige, very competitive position for which he was not at all qualified. When that didn't work, fiancé helped him get a job that he lost through no fault of his own when his company merged with another. Since then he's sent out resumes, but isn't working anywhere, even part time,. He does get unemployment and he and fiancé could afford to live on their own. They just don't.

BIL2 and BIL's gf are there too. I don't fault him for being there. He is temporarily staying there while getting treatment for a medical issue from a specialist there. He has his own place and does support himself. He just lives too far away from this specialist so he's staying at his mom's for now.

MIL has a dog. SIL has a dog. BIL1 has a dog. Now MIL is taking in another dog whose owner doesn't want him (a different relative) because she is just that nice.

No one contributes anything beyond groceries.

So, instead of having her cute home with her son temporarily staying in her guest room and her little dog chilling in the living room, she has every room including the living room used as someone's bedroom and her little dog is surrounded by big ones.

And everyone is fine with this. No one thinks that it isn't fair to the mom, they think they are welcome to stay forever. Which they are because she is so nice. But they shouldn't be. They should want to be self-supporting adults who aren't a drain on their mother, or at least pay her a little rent and help her save some money for a quickly-coming time when she won't have any.

Right now, I just get to help subsidize all this by paying for the housing, but I'm afraid I'll be subsidizing MIL when she runs out of money and the siblings-in-law when they pasively let themsves slide into never being truly independent.It is my understanding that fat cells don't disappear, they just shrink. I also know that skin doesn't shrink all the way either - that's why some people end up getting surgery. But what about other things, like veins carrying blood to the previously larger skin surface area, or cells from the fat person's larger liver, now shrunk down? Does everything just contract? How does this work? **Summary**:

A few weeks ago I learned about the subreddit /r/sexwithdogs. It is a real things and for people who sexually abuse animals. This is illegal in California where Reddit is based and animal abuse is never good, so I reported it and a bunch of links there. A mod of /r/sexiwth dogs  u/eponus,, followed me to a subreddit that I frequent (r/russia) and is posting at least two arguments a day in support of dog rape as well as personal attacks in r/russia.

**Charges:**

* Sexual abuse of dogs (self-admitted), support of others rapes of dogs

* Bad arguments and poor logic

* Genreal nastiness and douchbaggery

* Obsessive and annoying behavior

I am trying to rent my apartment. I am not doing short term rentals, although I could make more that way, because it kills living communities. I am not refusing Anmeldungen and I am asking a reasonable rent. In return, from possible applicants, I have received:

1. People who will not take no for an answer. If I say I only want to show to tenants who are in Berlin for security reasons, messaging me repeatedly throughout the day pretending that I didn’t say that in the hopes that I eventually I will come around will not work.
2. People who do not read. I don’t understand people who put themselves and then me through the hassle of writing to ask how many rooms it has, what the rent is, where it is, etc. That information is in the ad. It’s the basic stuff. 
3. People who treat me like their agency. As my ad says, I just have the one apartment. I cannot help you find a bigger one, or one in a different area. I also only speak the languages that I speak. Telling me you require that I speak Turkish because you prefer to do business in Turkish will not make me know how to speak Turkish. 
4. People who make me be their financial advisor. I feel bad telling someone they don’t make enough to afford the apartment. When they insist that they do, I end up pointing out that they shouldn’t spend more than half of their income on rent when there are many more less-central places or WGs that will leave them with more left over.
5. People who do not qualify for the apartment. If I get a bad tenant, it can take a year to evict them and cost me a few thousand Euros. I will have to keep paying the mortgage and Hausgeld in the meantime. In an unlucky situation, I could lose 20.000 EUR, and that is before I had to pay for any repairs. I cannot afford to lose that much money. I therefore only want tenants with verifiable income that can reasonably cover the rent. Messaging me to tell me that you will come up with the funds once you find a job is too much of a risk for me to take on. 
5. People who won’t take care of my apartment. It is two rooms. It is a home for a single person or a couple. I suppose I should appreciate the honesty of people telling me that they want it for a WG to fill both rooms with beds, but it seems disrespectful of my concerns about my property too. 
6. Liars. Please don’t waste my time and say that you are in Berlin and have all your documents and the Kaution ready when you aren’t and you don’t. This just wastes everyone’s time. 
7. The Hater. Fortunately only had one of these, but someone with a non-German first and last name saw my ad and took the time to message me to complain about people renting out apartments. She (wrongly, and based on nothing) assumed that I recently bought the place with money I got from a rich husband. I had to bite my tongue/hold my thumbs not to reply that it’s sexist to assume that women can’t be rich capitalist exploiters on their own, or to point out that people moving to Berlin are a major driver of rising prices. 

I have had a few good candidates, and am already feeling bad about having to say no to most, but this entire process has been such a miserable time suck filtering out the noise that I am sorry I didn’t start with what I initially didn’t want to be - super demanding, with strict rules and requirements and no time spent on anyone who couldn’t meet them. I get why landlords are like that now. If I had to do this more than once I would have to be too. I am dreading now having to go through the process of actually showing it. I can’t wait for this to be over. 
**Pro-protest attacks**

*DDoS targets: Interior Ministry, president’s site, Cabinet’s site, Party of Regions. Government’s site also offline on December 9 but the government didn’t offer an explanation and I don’t know why. 

*Compromises: 
Twitter account belonging to Podrobnosti.ua (Ukrainian online news owned by pro-government oligarch Dmytro Firtash) hacked, two fake tweets posted - one said “we are the most lying news” the other “D.V. Firtash, unfortunately, you run out of funds to continue publishing lies on this resource.”

*Hack: Supporters of the protesters took over the jumbotron in Maidan Square and posted pro-EU imagery.

*Possibly related (but probably attacked for a different reason): Ukrainian stock market, Ukrainian Banking Association

**Pro-state attacks**

*DDoS targets: Kharkiv Euromaidan page, Hromadske.tv, Channel 5, RBC-Ukraine, ZN.ua,  Left Bank, Criminal Ukraine, ZIK,  Tizhden, Zaxid.ua, Liga.net,  Ukr.net UAINFO, Divan.tv,  Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine, Cityband.com.ua, Censor.net, Zhytomyr.info, Transcarpathian Online, Glavnoe, Maidan Monitoring, Mukachevo.net, CitizenJournal.info, Panorama Mukachevo, Gorlovka.ua. Dreamline (hosting provider to Telekritika and 1+1), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (this last one coincided with protests but covers more than just Ukraine so the attack may be a coincidence).

*Deny service?

Security forces entered the offices of Censor.net, Vechernii Vesti and INTV and ordered staff to stay away from their computers and telephones.  Officially this was part of a law enforcement action.

*Compromises: 
Censor.Net compromised, files deleted

Social media of Vitali Klitschko, Larysa Sargan (representative of Yuriy Lutsenko) and Maryna Soroka (representative of Yulia Tymoshenko) temporarily taken over. 

Actors calling themselves Anonymous Ukraine using the term “OpIndependence” leaked 130 MB of emails that it says it stole from Klitchko’s UDAR party. The emails include those from Klichko and Laurynas Jonavičius, an advisor to the president of Lithuania. Among the many emails posted online are those discussing funding for Klichko’s efforts through Lithuania. 

**False-flag attacks?**

Someone defaced over 300 Ukrainian government sites and posted images claiming to be from the party Svoboda. Svoboda is far right and frequently denies accusations that it is connected to fascism or Nazism. In the defacements “Svoboda” depicts Nazis as a good thing and explicitly connects Svoboda now to Ukrainian historical Nazi partners.  This supports the pro-government narrative that protesters are fascist nationalists but it doesn't seem like something that Svoboda would do given its frequent denials of support for fascism. 

What am I missing? I'm sure I've missed some.

**TL;DR: Pro state DDoS attacks are the most common type on online attack and have occurred intermittently since the beginning of the protests. Other attacks in support of protests and the government also occurred.**"

Since Ezio is a fictional character and the Auditores are fictional I had always just assumed that Monteriggioni was just a made-up place as well.  Pretty cool.I'm curious if you guys would be as excited about this as I would be.

The subject of the Crusades have come up elsewhere, and my mind instantly went to Assassin's Creed, the original.  I love the swords, the throwing knives, etc. while both fighting swordsmen in the streets, and knights of full armor!

Sure, you kind of get that in Unity, but the prospect of the technology being 600 years older, more archaic, but also used in an updated game engine is a very exciting idea.

Plus, there's the opportunity to put sequels to Altair's journey!  Assassin's Creed took place in the 2nd Crusade, which was 1147–1149.  The 3rd Crusade was 40 years later (the damn 3rd Crusade even has a nickname according to Wikipedia: ""The King's Crusade"".. the first suggestion for the game's title has already been written) -- which is just about enough time for Altair's son or daughter to continue his legacy!

Of course there's the whole thing about Desmond et al. and the Animus, but certainly there can be a work around that, since after all, Altair *did* have a life independent to his future descendant and I think it would be really neat to see where that would go!

What do you think?  If you like it or not, tell us why.

EDIT 1: And yes, the story must stay the same.  Or at least *the main details* must remain.  The smaller details can be changed, which could be its own way of making it interesting.  As if to say, ""No, it didn't happen *that* way.. it happened more like *this*..""

EDIT 2: The original Assassin's Creed was set in the ***THIRD*** Crusade.  Not the Second.  Correction thanks to /u/Eagleassassin3[removed]I left the link out of the title so as to be clear that I am *not* promoting it, but calling for Reddit to do whatever it can to have it taken down!

If I'm ""late to the party"", if this has been reported already, then I apologize.  This is obviously new to me.  And if there's anything we can do to put our heads together to fight this, let's talk about it here.

I mean, there should be a cease and desist letter mailed to these guys, shouldn't there?

Discuss, noble Reddits!I remember mentions in this sub of people attempting such a suit, but.. ??  The trail goes cold.  (How funny would it be if they got awarded and we all missed out -- that would probably also mean a major step towards reversal, which is the real goal here)

I realize there's an opioid epidemic that is more destructive to our community than anything that ISIL could accomplish.  There is no (read: effective) agency to protect our children, siblings, cousins from opioid addiction.

But this act was intentional.  C'mon, these weren't politicians who made that MME chart.  They were MDs.  They knew that thousands of people would physically suffer in the process, with no legal alternative whatsoever aside from a bullet, though even that's illegal.

Revenge isn't the purpose here; as far as I'm concerned anyway.  I want recognition and a fitting punishment to set precedent for in case any agency in the future decides to play austerity bureaucrat again with medical diagnoses of practicing physicians nationwide.

Sure, chronic pain sufferers aren't dying (much) over this, and pain doesn't show up on an X-Ray or EKG, so our very real pain can only be expressed with our words, and some doctors -- and residencies, as unfortunately I've experienced recently -- refuse to acknowledge that the standard set by that MME chart is insufficient; that they are not treating us to criteria, but rather by **checklist** to determine whether we're exhibiting drug seeking behavior, even when we've been following the rules.  

God forbid, that I sound ungrateful for their under-prescribed treatment when I run down the list of problems I have every day in an attempt to relate to them, only to be met with, ""Well, the administrators at the CDC are very sure about their ban on high doses of opioids..""  Well that's great for those administrators, they feel assured in themselves.  **They're still wrong!** And I suffer for it every day.  All of a sudden either the CDC is wrong, or I'm a liar, and so are all of you, *lying about your pain to get high on some drugs (/s).*  This is the jist of my recent appointment, with the residency that my otherwise very noble doctor took in.  She made the discussion feel like I was in the vice principal's office -- in my 40s -- because she had to exercise her newly attained authority.  Sorry, ranting, but for sure some, if not many of you have had a similar experience.  ""I understand.  I understand.  I understand.""  I'm sure you understand the *language* I'm speaking, but you're completely ignoring the situation I'm trying painstakingly to express to you!!  Bah.  And I don't even blame her.  I blame the CDC.

***TL;DR*** *- In lieu of legit pain and suffering, inprisonment by substandard treatment, loss of what otherwise would be an active life (just rattling off my experience; some of you surely have more injustice to add to this list),* ***can any of you ELI5*** *[explain like I'm 5]* ***why a class action suit hasn't happened yet?***  *If there's a good reason, or a BS reason that stands in our way of a class action suit, I'm just curious what it is.*


P.S. -- I recognise that my language is strong, but it reflects effectively how I feel on this and I apologise ahead of time for any offense, if the case.I can see why certain materials are more rarely found and that ammo like 2mm EM, Plasma and Gamma rounds are harder to find, but shucks.. why is it so damn hard to stock up on the ones mentioned in the title?

Railway spikes should be much easier to find, too, since The Commonwealth has about as much rail design as The Capital Wasteland, does it not?  Heck, one of the factions has ""Railroad"" in their name, for petesake!

So what do you think?  Do you agree that we should be able to have .44, shotgun and railway ammunition in Fallout 4?

And if not, then why not?  There might be a good reason.  I just don't see it.

--------

*Note: if you're going to explain against shotgun shells being more prevalent in the game because of the power of a combat shotgun, nevermind the ones with special perks or whatever, I remind you to try to fight with one in a fight that involves targets at a distance.  They're much less useful at long range, for obvious reasons.*"

Most honest quote of World Cup media day comes from Evgeny Kuznetsov on Nikita Kucherov still not having a contract: ""If I would be in his position, I would be signed in the KHL for sure... I would sign and say bye. That's me. I would buy a beach house and a couple Rolls-Royces."""
HTRK74JR,5,3,"As of late /r/halo has become extremely aggressive towards people who like the story of Halo more than multiplayer. This has become apparent since many are forcing players to /r/HaloStory . However, why is the /r/halo subreddit not allowed to have anything other than art or multiplayer related discussions?

Lore discussions never make it to the top of the subreddit anymore, instead they are told to go to /r/halostory. Only complaining about MCC or Halo 5 makes it to the top, with the occasional thread stating how terrible the community is, or random art that people have created for halo.

I have been told, multiple times, that the story in Halo accounts for jack shit and that the game is only popular for the multiplayer, I'm sorry but excuse me?

Here's an actual quote i got earlier when i said Halo 4s story was amazing, that left me flabbergasted.

>No, it wasn't, it was cheesy, predictable superhero schlock. Halo 4's story was about on par with one of those Syfy killer shark movies.
And even if Halo 4 was fucking phenominal story-wise, why the hell would it matter? ***Who the hell plays video games for the story? Go watch a fucking movie.***

This seems to be the mindset for many, many multiplayer only guys. There is an entire group of Halo fans who play the game for the lore, the story of the master chief, the covenant, and the UNSC. Not everyone wants to be super competitive mlg pros in multiplayer, they just want to have fun.


The campaign for CE was amazing, 2 was great, 3 was fantastic, and 4 knocked it out of the ballpark.

However, if you even MENTION that you enjoyed the story in halo 4 when a circlejerk is going on, you get insulted, berated, downvoted, and forced out of the subreddit. It's just pathetic.

People are trying to claim that Halo is dying, but i don't think it is. It is very much alive, and it's with the campaign and how the lore keeps expanding to become better and better.

Halo 5 Guardians multiplayer, for the first time, looks to be a multiplayer that i will be able to play all day. I'm excited, however I'm not excited for the ""fanbase"" to react to the multiplayer, and kicking out the campaign lovers out of this subreddit

And one last thing, I'm fully expecting dozens of insults and messenges to come my way telling me that I'm wrong, that this doen't happen, how i'm a n00b for playing campaign etc.

Well i have a newsflash for you /r/halo, this is NOT /r/halomultiplayer, it is /r/halo.


Edit: So i woke up and this took off, thanks /r/halo! and also, someone just gave me gold, holy shit thanks!At Basic Training in Fort Benning in 2015, it was the morning of the final FTX. It was Monday morning, and we had spent the previous day prepping everything, cleaning our rifles and writing letters home. Saturday, we had gone on convoy ambush training, so all of our M16s needed cleaned after firing blanks for the training.

My platoon was the only one that had a rifle drill perfected, where we were inspecting the weapons (shoot me, I don't remember what it was called) and were showing off in front of the company leadership. During this, Privates were falling out of formation, running back into the barracks, grabbing what they forgot and running back in. The entire company was doing this.

Enter Private Fucktard. Private Fucktard was famous for being a Blue Falcon. We told multiple times throughout Sunday that he needed to clean his rifle. Come around Monday morning, and he runs out of the barracks and joins us mid drill. We decide to do it again.

As we do the drill, and we get to the part where we dry fire our weapons after checking the chambers, we heard a loud ***BANG***

The entire platoon scatters away from Private fucktard. Who, in his infinite wisdom, still had a blank round in his chamber. Who didn't check his weapon and give back all the rounds back to the Drills, and never cleaned his weapon. Even then, when we checked our weapons during the drill, he failed to see the live blank round.

Every single DS, CO and XO within earshot converged on Private Fucktard and literally dragged him into the building. His weapon was taken away and was made to carry a large stick. The ass chewing he received was one of epic proportions. He never did graduate, as he had also failed every single PT test up to graduation. Last I saw him was him congratulating me on graduating and he was sent to be processed out.The app on the One currently is awful. No categories, seriously, where is the comedy, the anime, the action sections?

No restart movie/episode button. Seriously, the amount of times that i stop a movie at the credits, and then when i tried fast-forwarding it, it just took me back to the beginning of the credits. it needs fixed.

Metro doesn't work for the app. It worked better before, back when Microsoft designed the app."
zombiefriend,7,5,"http://imgur.com/a/qhdIF8uTitleI feel like they're one of the better developers out there that treat their fans right, and lately they keep getting shit on about every little detail. 

You've got whiny social justice warriors throwing their political agendas into their reviews. There's people crying about downgraded graphics that are there to help make the game more playable on modern hardware, not FUTURE hardware (remember Crysis?) and oh, no! Stores breaking street dates? Well, jeez, they better release the game RIGHT NOW or else! 

I don't think a lot of people realize how crappy Projekt Red used to be. They were going after pirates demanding thousands of dollars from them which is completely absurd. They were one of the only companies to come out and say ""yeah, maybe that was dumb on our part."" And they used to be big advocates for putting DRM on their games. They changed their ways dramatically into the company they are today. Free DLC? Who does that anymore? They are one of the most pro-consumer companies out there, and now they get shit on and compared to companies like Ubisoft. Give me a break. "

We're using a cheap insignia power supply (520w) from best buy until he can afford a better one (I advised against it but he insisted)

So I am helping a friend build a gaming computer... rather remotely (he lives in Wisconsin and I'm in TN).  Anyways he has all the parts put together and installed in the case.  We have ran into some troubles along the way (if he was closer I would have just built it myself for him but being 12 hours away I couldn't, lol).  First issue was the CPU cable on the mobo being to short to reach so I ordered him an extension.  He got that in today and hooked it up.  Now we have everything connected and he is ready to boot the computer up and install the OS.  Push the power button and everything kicks on, the mobo lights up, gpu lights up and all fans are spinning but there is no signal going to the monitor.  Turns out he had the cable connected to the mobo and not the gpu.  We correct this (he has to use a DVI/VGA adapter as his monitor only has VGA inputs).  Time for round #2.  He boots it back on and everything lights up again but still we have no signal to the monitor.  I'm at a loss after trying to trouble shoot it with him over google hangouts.


So far we have tried the following:

1) Unplugging everything for a minute and trying again.

2) Trying a different monitor (well... TV)

3) Removing the GPU and using Intel Integrated Graphics

4) Removing the CMOS battery

5) Removing a stick of ram one at a time to see if either of those were the problem

6) Putting everything back together and give it a last go to see if ti works


I'm kind of running out of ideas.  I know the parts he is using aren't the best (he was in the process of upgrading them when he got the money and the i3 was from his old HP desktop he bought a few months ago) but ever still I'm at a loss of where to go next.. other than potential DOA components (he bought all of them new but the CPU which he has been using fine and even still works on his old desktop).

Sorry for the long post.  Think I gave a little to much backstory but I'm not used to being stumped on something like this and I am leaning towards a possible DoA mobo or something (possibly just incompatible with the CPU dell used).  So let's try something I don't normally do and ask for help!  Thanks for reading reddit!

Like it's the new version of being a vegan or doing crossfit, but because it's cloaked in terms of mental illness, nobody is supposed to call anybody out for narcissistic attention seeking, which is the heart of the crack like appeal of social media after all.

It also unironically detracts from the real issue of depression."

#Solar System Class Guide

##The Capital Letter (O,B,F,G,K,M,E)

The first letter represents its heat range, in degrees Kelvin. The brightness and color of the star directly correlates to the rate at which it burns hydrogen. The slower the rate, the cooler the star and the dimmer the light. The faster the rate, the more energy is released.

 * O     ≥ 30,000 K	

 * B     10,000-30,000 K	

 * F     6,000-7,500 K	

 * G    5,200-6,000 K	

 * K    3,700-5,200 K	

 * M   2,400-3,700 K	

E-type stars do not exist IRL, so no heat range can be estimated. ~~Due to its color, I can estimate that it's most likely burning a copper compound, probably a copper oxide. This can not exist in reality, since its too heavy an element to maintain burning. Most stars collapse under their own weight once the materials catalyze into iron, and copper's atomic weight is around 3 points higher than iron.~~ 

The color of the planet, unlike what I had originally thought, has nothing to do with the element/compound being burned, but at what level the radiation peaks, and how the other forms of radiation work to counteract the colors. For example, our sun radiates out at about the same frequency (500-570 nanometers) as an E-class star, but also radiates a blue and red light that offsets the green hue. This leads to the observable light being interpreted by our eyes as being white.

Fun Facts past this point.

Stars are approximately ""black bodies in thermal equilibrium"", basically meaning that, internally, the absorb most of the energy they produce, while simultaneously emitting that same amount of energy as electromagnetic radiation (light) from their outer layers. The reason this is significant here is that the amount of light emitted at various wavelengths from the star, and thus the color of the star, can be determined based only on the temperature of the star via [Planck's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law).

Thanks to /u/zexoventer69 for this info.

##The Number (0-9)

This number pertains to where that particular star stands within its respective heat range.

##The Lowercase Letter (e,f,h,k,m, etc.)

The last letter refers to specific anomalies observed within the star itself. It's currently unknown whether or not these letters amount to an actual difference within the game.

 * e = Emission lines present

 * f = N III and He II emission

 * h = WR stars with emission lines due to hydrogen

 * k = Spectra with interstellar absorption features

 * m = Enhanced metal features

 * n = Broad (""nebulous"") absorption due to spinning

 * p = Unspecified peculiarity

 * q = Red & blue shifts line present

 * s = Narrowly ""sharp"" absorption lines

 * v = Variable spectral feature

 * w = Weak lines

#Other Tips

 * If you need any common material, along with Titanium or Thamium9, attack a fleet of freighters. Defend against the first wave of sentinel drones, then book it for the nearest planet. They'll stop pursuing you at the atmospheric barrier.

 * When building a base, stock up on iron. The best way to do this is to blast apart asteroids.

 * You can use the teleporters to take resources from your home planet to where they're of the highest value.

 * Invest in agriculture. Plants don't have to be replanted after being harvested, and can mean an endless amount of Albumen Pearls, Gravitino Orbs, Sac Venoms, and possibly more.

 * If you plan on using your freighter exclusively for storing goods, save your money and invest in storage containers instead. They hold 5 slots each, each up to 1000 for raw materials, and 10 for objects and craftables. You can have up to 10 containers.

 * An even quicker way to get iron is those cone shaped iron deposits found in and around caves. Hit a cluster of them with a grenade and you can get hundreds of iron in a single hit. ~/u/spacedog_at_home

 * When flying over planets, only mineable elements spawn. Thamium9 plants, Rigogen, and other items that have to be interacted with using the action button won't spawn until you land.

If you have any to add, let me know so I can update the list.

Video Log: Captain Spencer Kleine, Terminal 12, Facility 19.

June 30th, 2184.

Location tracking disabled.

[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]

SPENCER: Hello, I'm Captain Spencer Kleine. I've been tasked by my superiors to deliver this news to everyone in the past. There's something coming, and we never saw it until it was too late.

[COMMUNICATIONS REQUEST]

COMPUTER: Record VOIP chat in video log?

SPENCER: Yes.

COMPUTER: Confirmed.

SPENCER: This is Spencer.

RICHARD: Captain, have you begun the briefing?

SPENCER: Yes sir, it's happening right now, actually. You interrupted me.

RICHARD: Oh. Carry on. Just remember, document EVERYTHING.

SPENCER: Got it.

[END COMMUNICATIONS]

SPENCER: Now, where was I?

[SILENCE]

SPENCER: Oh yeah. Around 1300 hours on June 1st, we detected an anomaly distorting the space around a distant part of the Horsehead Nebula. Analysis showed its growth rate seemed to be exponential, faster than the speed of light. To be exact, the mass seems to be expanding one light year every hour. Propulsion methods are currently unknown, but it seems unphased by gravitational effects and has maintained a perfectly constant velocity.

It took an hour or so, but one of our imaging satellites finally aligned with the proper angle to capture an image of the mass. First, the Hyper-Velocity LADAR was pointed at the object, and we quickly found out that it was not expanding, but moving straight for us at twice the originally estimated speed. Trajectory analyses showed that not only was it traveling at 2Ly/hr, it was making a beeline straight for us.

We had known about superluminal travel for a while, but we'd never imagine actually seeing a non-energy entity traveling at those speeds in our lives aside from ourselves.

After the imaging had concluded, a raw file showed that the object seemed to have a jagged opening on the side directly facing Earth that we had deemed the ""maw"" of the object jokingly.

At 1700, we sent five men in a superluminal cruiser to intercept and analyze the object, as well as document the nature of its composition. At speeds like that, any energy that leaves the protection of the FTL bubble would dissipate in the friction caused by passing particles.

The team launched without complications and achieved FTL only minutes after leaving Earth's well.

On June 25th at 0512, our recon team arrived at the asteroid. Initial analysis showed that the object seemed to be remarkably light, with it only generating just over a single Earth in weight despite being the size of Jupiter.

Visual reports say that the object's maw seems to have a mechanism that allows it to open and shut periodically. The composition scan returned inconclusive, so there was no way of knowing whether or not this object was indeed alive or mechanical, which seemed the only two logical solutions. The cruiser was ordered to match velocity.

On June 27th at 0700, our sensors indicated that the object had suddenly reduced speed, equivalent to dropping out of FTL. Our team confirmed this and they had done likewise.

At 0730, the object had slowed to a halt within an uncharted star system.

Video footage then showed the object was more than a protoplanet. Analysis probes had provided secondary confirmation that the object was indeed an immense creature. Sentience is currently unknown. The team requested to refuel at the star. Clearance was granted and their fuel tank was replenished fully by 0745.

At that same time, a fluctuation in their shields caused an unknown amount of damage, but the IT onboard confirmed that unshielded hard drives were wiped and the external cameras were inoperable.

Once clear of the star, they resumed chase of the object, which they claimed to have uncurled from a ball into a large winged creature. While the whole of the creature still seemed mostly spherical, the wings and tail protruded out of it in a way that reminded me of those goddamned eyeballs from the video game Terraria.

[VOICE MUFFLED. ATTEMPTING TRANSCRIPTION]

SPENCER: Damn surprised the Grand Archive even let me play a gem(Possibly: game, gun) from their collection.

[VOICE VOLUME RESTORED]

Anyway, once the team was pursuing the target, it showed signs of agitation. One team member reported a deafening whine that no other crewmate heard. This was almost dismissed as an episode of tinnitus, until the on-board medic reported that his ears had begun to bleed.

The target, now traveling at only half the speed of light, made an about-face and now appears to be facing the local star. The crewmates reported subterranean activity as they said the entire creature seemed to expand in size as the maw opened wide, and, as stated by Lt. Murray, ""fuckin ate the goddamned sun whole!""

Their sensors noted a massive electromagnetic surge within the creature as it aimed itself back at Earth and curled up its appendages. The vessel was temporarily incapacitated by the EMP, and was ordered to report to the nearest station for repairs.

At 0820, docking was confirmed at a station 15 Ly away and repairs had begun.

At 0841 on June 27th, an FTL wake was detected from the creature. A readout showed that the creature was now traveling ten times faster at 10Ly/s, faster than human vessels can travel. The total distance from it to us was estimated at 1370 Ly.

As a precaution, vectors were recalculated and it was confirmed that the creature was not heading for our star, but still maintained its course directly for Earth.

At 0900, a state of emergency was declared and a team assembled to try and come up with the solutions. A global clock began counting down, starting at 5 days 15 hours until arrival.

On June 29th at 1324, an analysis showed that it appears to accelerate past lightspeed by displacing itself temporally. The creature may be able to shift itself through time entirely, which is why my superiors found it of critical importance to send this message. If it finishes us off and learns that we could be attempting to stop it early, it may be able to move backwards in time to attempt to stop us from either sending the message or possibly just eliminate us altogether.

At 1500, it was decided that the creature was most likely extradimensional in nature, and alongside that was deemed ""most likely sentient"" by a panel of leading scientists.

Earlier today at 1700, scientists have come up with a list of do's and don't's for the creature:

* Energy weapons used within or aimed at the maw will not work, since the creature likely has high protection necessary for the ability to consume whole stars for fuel. This includes:
 * Any thermonuclear detonations in the atmosphere of the creature
 * Cascade resonance cannons
 * Plasma cannons
 * Gauss cannons
* Bombarding with physical weaponry may work, but a composition analysis has shown that the creature seems to have an exoskeleton, with the thinnest reported depth being half a mile of a substance we know nothing about and have never even seen or heard of before.
* The atmosphere that seems to surround the creature appears to be ammonia-based, so high-density sodium hypochlorite bombing followed by microwave irradiation to catalyze the atmosphere into the acid dichloramine is currently being analyzed as a possibility, but can't be confirmed until a sample is obtained. If this velocity is maintained, that may not be possible at all.

According to estimates, it will take the creature approximately 3 hours to slow from 10 lightyears to a stop, and an extra 15 minutes for it to unfurl, followed by a final 30 minutes before the creature can consume Earth.

Once a change is noted, I will report back and update the situation.

Until then, I'm going to attempt to get some sleep.

This is Captain Kleine, logging off.

[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]

SPENCER: It is currently 10 hours from first contact with the creature. Our scientists have made a few points of progress, but aside from that, we're still very much in the dark about the purpose of this creature.

On July 1 at 1000, a secondary superluminal unmanned probe was sent to analyze the surface of the planet was sent and touched down with no complications. Further analysis showed that the atmosphere was many degrees below freezing with an ammonia-based atmosphere. Large creatures reminiscent to stiltbugs skim the surface of the waters of the lakes. On land, there appear to be parasitoids that drill into the exoskeleton to extract the marrow.

Past that, we have confirmed that the creature seems to be agitated by the actions of the parasitoid's feeding patterns, with the whole planet seeming to shudder in discomfort or pain.

A surface sample was collected and analyzed before being consumed by an unknown entity. 

As per someone's request, I notified the scientific board that gauss cannons were, in fact, not energy-based. 

We still don't know how to proceed with thi-

[COMMUNICATIONS REQUEST]

COMPUTER: VOIP recording not available for this call.

SPENCER: This is Spencer.

[SILENCE]

SPENCER: YOU HAVE A WHAT?!

Alright, I'll let them know. Thanks.

[END COMMUNICATIONS]

SPENCER: I've been told to report in that a highly-classified railgun protoype has just been rolled out. It currently orbits the sun and uses a combination of supermagnets, explosives, and tachyon bubble technology to deliver a 5 ton cartridge at superluminal speeds. Worse comes to worse, I would be told it would be our last plan of action.

In the meantime, Generation Ships are finishing up their construction and many people will now have the ability to leave Earth. The ships currently complete will be able to hold over 70% of the Earth's current population, with the other 30% being comprised of people who could be considered ""space-faring ship owners"".

On the combat front, all able-bodied pilots have been asked to stock up on chlorine and oxygen, and rendezvous at Lennon Station, our planetside moonbase, to prepare for orbital bombardment. There will be an estimated 10,000,000 fighters in the air, 500 dreadnoughts, and 50 capital ships for an estimated payload of 100 trillion gallons of chlorine plus 50 trillion loads of oxygen, followed up by a 5-ton depleted uranium shot going faster than lightspeed. Basically, we're turning the creature's atmosphere into a massive toxic bomb that the shearings from the uranium will detonate, causing a surge into the crater created by the round, causing a massive fireball to rush into the creature's soft interior, cooking it from the inside. Estimates put it at approximately 60% that it will manage to cripple or kill the creature.

If not, we have the capacity to fire up to ten 5-ton depleted uranium rounds at the creature, which puts the estimates up to 90% fatality chance.

I have a great feeling about this. My CO has ordered a complete blackout from the time of arrival to the time of the mission's conclusion. We're waiting for a report from one of our Mars bases, so expect to see that sometime later.

Until then, wish us luck.

Crustycrustacean,4,7,"I tried searching for this particular issue in previous threads but didn't find anything so apologies if this is a repost. The braided metal supply hose that runs to my dishwasher froze tonight or last night. I turned off the supply valve so it shouldn't leak, just in case it burst. Temperatures should get back to normal soon so it will likely thaw itself shortly, if not I will run a space heater under the cabinet to speed it up.

My question is mainly if I need to replace this supply line now that it has frozen? Is it weaker now that it has frozen once? Or is it fine to leave it as is assuming it didn't burst? I just installed the dishwasher this year with a brand new supply hose so I would prefer to not have to pull it out and replace it again already. I couldn't find an answer to this online. What do you guys think?My fiancee and I love chicken kievs. It's a quick, cheap, easy, semi-healthy food to make. We used to eat them a couple times a week until our grocery store jacked up the price on the ones we liked. All the other brands are either terrible or overpriced. I was thinking of making a big batch of maybe 10 homemade chicken kievs then vacuum sealing and freezing them. Would it be OK to fry them to get the crust golden brown before freezing or is that something I would have to do after? Is this even a good idea? How long do you think they would last if they were vacuum sealed and frozen? I am hoping for 2-3 months.

I am mainly concerned that the breading or the filling would go bad or lose the right texture or something. I have been searching online and I haven't been able to find anyone else that has frozen pre-made kievs before. All the recipes assume you will be cooking them immediately or will be frying them after they are frozen before they go in the oven. It seems way easier to fry them in a batch before freezing though if that won't ruin  them.

We like the broccoli and cheese filled ones, so that is probably what we would try to make if it is relevant. Any suggestions?"
Cactuar49,6,1,"Basically the title: [[Contract from Below]] is very elegantly designed and I wanted to share why.

First off, the flavor! You get paid (via your opponent's ante) to draw eight cards. It's a simple concept, but it feeds into my second point: the card is an example of a ""soft threshold."" What I mean is that the card technically costs 1 mana, but isn't functionally available to you until you have 1 mana and are also playing for ante. The Gotcha mechanic is similar, in that its functional boost isn't available until you're playing an unsanctioned format. In fact, that's what got me thinking about Contract from Below.

It's a 1 mana wheel spell that isn't available until you play for ante. I suppose it's not a soft threshold then, but a hard one.

Idk I'm really fascinated with card design and I think Contract from Below is a perfect example of flavor and function together (as opposed to [[Timetwister]], which is sloppy in comparison). How do you make time twist° it makes no sense!After the podrace, [Anakin an Greedo get in a scuffle](https://youtu.be/8cFOJX4ch_U?t=13m35s) over whether or not Anakin cheated. Anakin claimed that he did not, and he didn't - at least not knowingly.

[Here](https://youtu.be/8cFOJX4ch_U?t=5m54s) we see Jar Jar messing with Anakin's pod. And just 22 seconds later, we see young Greedo [parading around the exact same area](https://youtu.be/8cFOJX4ch_U?t=6m18s). Coincidence? Perhaps Greedo witnessed Jar Jar's meddlings, and as a result, accused Anakin of cheating.

And Greedo is adamant about it too - when [confronted by Qui-Gon Jinn](https://youtu.be/8cFOJX4ch_U?t=13m51s), Greedo sticks by his story. And after the encounter, Greedo runs back to another Rodian (possibly his father?), speaks with the Rodian, and is promptly told off. It's not a huge leap to assume that when Greedo spoke, he was arguing his side of the story to the other Rodian. This makes sense, considering the events directly before, and his scolding, which would have been for telling stories.

Does anyone have any more solid evidence to back this up?So there's this guy in my mythology class that I've been talking to for the past few weeks, and I'm really interested in him. My only problem is our ages: He's 17, and I'm also 17. Would it be weird to date with such a little difference?

They are sized for a single 22x30 sheet, but you can tile them as a poster on 4 11x17 sheets, if you scale them to ~95% scale.

Random thoughts:

Rules: Will it be more or less like the original or updated to be in line with the current 40k ruleset? Will it be along the lines of Kill Team/Zone Mortalis? Will it be Age of Helmawr?

Minis: I think press-fit minis have come along way since the original Beefy, interchangeable-armed Goliaths ... I'm sure alot of you, like me have made use of the Renegades from Dark Vengeance. Would be curious to see if they retain the same houses.

Terrain: Would be nice to see a modular system along the lines of Mantic's deadzone stuff.

missy070203,1,2,"Sometimes they can be lazy, mouthy, bratty, messy, and jerks.

But today my teenage daughter lied to me. She told me she was walking to a friend's house to study for keystones. 

She walked a mile to CVS in the rain  and bought me a mother's day card and stopped at the flower shop down the street and bought me flowers. 

I love this kid's guts. 💜💜💜💜I posted last week about my sister's overdose and the uncertain placement of her kids. Children and Youth got involved and are trying to place them with her Ex. He's terrible and my sister goes to rehab tomorrow. 

I hired an attorney and I'm seeking guardianship. I have a face to face with the attorney on Friday and the hearing is Monday. Until then they will be sleeping on the floor in the living room of their father's apartment. =/

I thought it would be tight in our house but we're going to make it work. We're going to put bunk beds in the teenager's room so she can share with my 9 year old niece, move the baby into our bedroom (we side car now, but the crib will be moved) and setting up a single bed in the nursery for my 7 year old nephew. 

She can't take care of them and he only wants them for what he can get from/for them and a welfare check. My nephew already failed 1st grade once and he is struggling this year again and both kids are pretty heartbroken at the moment. 

They need someone who gives a shit about them, who is willing to put their needs and best interests first. I'm going to fight for that.

As hard as I can.I'll just leave this here....

""Having grandchildren is the reason we didn't choke our teenagers. We worked hard raising our kids so that we could get the prize...grandchildren.""

The comments and rebuttals following are funny and terrifying and the same time. 
She is ok. She has a bruise on her face and had a bloody nose at the time. But she is ok.

He was holding her and walking with her when he tripped over a stray block on the floor. They both went down. He's a big guy and he fumbled her like a football and pushed her away from his body. Instead of free falling 5 or 6 feet from his arms or under him, he managed to fumble her to about a foot from the hardwood floor and away from his body. She landed belly down on all 4s and hit her face on the wood floor, hard. 

We spent the night at the ER and even now that we're home and she is ok, he can't look at the bruise on her face without crying like a baby. My older daughter cried in the car the entire way to the hospital and no one slept last night, except for the baby.

Accidents happen. It could have been much worse. He did everything he could to minimize her impact. She is ok and I am grateful. I'm not going to lie, I was terrified.  I saw them falling and was powerless to stop it. I screamed, loud enough to startle the neighbors, then swooped her up and said ""hospital now"" and out the door we went.

Guys, she is ok. My baby is ok.My twin sister overdosed on heroin on Thursday. They revived her after 3 doses of narcan and she's in the ICU. 

 We're not close but she has 2 children. I love my niece and nephew very much. I just can't understand how anyone can choose heroin over their 2 beautiful kids. They think the sun shines out of her ass but what's left of her life revolves around dope.

I went to see her yesterday and she was blaming everyone else for her drug use. Everything that she said started with I and ended with me. 

She and our mother are estranged. She told me; ""I need a mother"".... I told her ""your children need a mother"".

I feel so much anger for her, for doing this to her kids.A little background. Hubs works construction and the my 12 year old daughter has school uniforms and just started wearing makeup. Because of hubs dirty work clothes and daughters uniforms I do 8-10 loads of laundry every Saturday plus 4+ additional loads mid-week (Tuesday or Weds).

Daughter comes down in a huff into the kitchen while hubs and I are packing lunches, cleaning up, feeding dog etc. and yells that I have to go to Old Navy after work and buy her more polos for her school uniforms. She says she has no clothes. 

She has already stained 3 shirts this week with foundation. This happens because she spills the makeup on her dresser and doesn't clean it off and then leans into it getting closer to the mirror to put her mascara on. 

Every day I tell her to clean her dresser and make her bed etc. 

Every day she blows me off to play video games.

Ladies, I fucking lost it. I know for a fact she has polos in her closet with the tags still on them. They're just not ""her favorites"".  Not only is she too lazy to clean her dresser, she is also too lazy to look in her closet or clean anything else in her room.

I yelled, made her go up and look in the closet (filled with clothes), and show me she has nothing to wear. Then dropped the bomb on her that I hope she doesn't have any weekend plans because we are going through and cleaning her entire room with garbage bags this weekend. 

I'm sick of being blown off. I'm sick of replacing things that are ""lost"" only because she is too lazy to look for them and I'm sick of being asked to replace things that are ruined out of laziness and carelessness. 

I'm too fucking pregnant to deal with this fucking shit.

She called me when she got home from school and was being a snot on the phone. When I asked her what her problem was she said:

""I'm still upset about this morning. You yelled at me and ruined my morning""

I'm pretty sure the ruining of mornings worked both ways this morning. Your still in trouble and we are still cleaning your room this weekend. Since you haven't done it on your own the last 50 times I asked you with out yelling, we will be doing this my way.

Our first question concerns a small mountain cabin that is currently insured as a property that we rarely visit for weekend vacation purposes. We've just leased it to a tenant who will live there fulltime and we are anxious to know whether the premium will go up or down after the insurance agency is notified. (I'm hoping that property that is regularly occupied is less expensive to insure due to the reduced risk of vandalism, etc.)

Also, our mother passed away recently and we'll be leasing her home to new tenants (and storing her furniture in the garage). Is the premium for rental property typically greater or lesser than owner-occupied? (I'm assuming rental property premiums are higher because it's assumed that tenants are not typically as caring about property as homeowners are.)

I am dealing with an inherited genetic condition that eventually led to me having been bed-ridden for the past 8 years or so. As of 1995, I could no longer work in an office but luckily I could work from home and continue to earn an income and contribute to Social Security. After 2000, I could only work sporadically and thus have not earned sufficient points to, according to them, be qualified to receive disability benefits. Am I now screwed because I continued to work as best I could rather than file for benefits years ago? (As an aside, I was married for more than ten years, but am now divorced. Do his earnings and contributions help my situation any?)

Hi, all.  This is a question for insurance claims adjusters: 

My mother is a dementia patient (condition: severe) living in an assisted living facility in Georgia.   We recently noticed that her wedding rings are missing from her finger (she never took them off in the 55 years she's had them).  The facility says it's our tough luck, we should have had renter's insurance.  Would renter's insurance cover something that was literally stolen from a person's body?  I'm thinking it would only cover other things, like furniture, but not something that was actually taken off of someone.  Am I wrong?  Should I insist on making a claim against the facility's insurance carrier?  There is, of course, no way of proving anything one way or another.  We asked the facility to at least report the theft to police, but we doubt the rings will ever be recovered, regardless of what we may do.

FWIW, the rings were hugely sentimental to Mom, who expected to be buried with them.  My sister and I feel terrible, believing it's entirely possible Mom is aware the rings are missing and is probably hugely sad over the loss.

Wondering if any of you were at the NRA annual meeting and stopped by our booth to check out our products? I wasn't there this time, but I'm curious to hear what people think.

I'll delete if not allowed, but our Instagram link is here: https://www.instagram.com/energeticarmament

Optionthename,4,5,"Good day everyone... I got audited for my 2011 ($1500) tax return which was paid off with my 2014 tax return (ended up being $2900 after adjustments)
 I was audited because I claimed ~$1500 for college books for classes I was taking in 2011. The problem arises that my 1098T showed that I had paid nothing towards the school since I was receiving a scholarship that covered the full amount of tuition this year but not the books. I didn't keep any receipts for my purchases having never had in issue in all the years I had been taking classes. Which I now realize is idiotic and just chalked it up to live and learn.

However I have since seen multiple success posts of writing to the IRS and mostly pleading your case with them as they do have some discretionary wiggle room. I can prove I was in school, number of classes and total cost of books suggested for each course (comes out to $2300), but again no receipts.

Question is: How can/should I appeal this, and does anyone have any suggestions in achieving a favorable outcome.

Thank you for your time and help. Apologies for errors, and idiocy, this is my second post ever.[removed]Thanks for reading and your help... Only had my pool for a year and this is the first serious winter weather i've went through. We had several days of temps in the 20s where i live, while it gets that cold it typically warms up to above freezing during the day. So I was unprepared and foolish for the situation and let my salt cell freeze over and explode.

Had a guy come out and he quoted $700. Looking at it, it seemed as if just the housing was damaged and that it was a pretty easy fix that I could handle myself for just the cost of a new cell housing for [$88 on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IEEQT2W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). 

Problem is i cant get the damn thing to seal properly. I bought new o rings thinking that was the problem. The housing seems too tight and forces the O ring from their seat, causing a leak when pressurized. Can i put some Silicone spray, or vaseline to slide it down and seat properly? It's an older model Circupool RJ30

TLDR; Salt cell housing exploded, bought new housing on Amazon and cant get it to sit right. Any professional tips?[removed][removed][removed][removed]"

Lemwell,2,7,"Recently in giving advice to someone new to jazz on this subreddit I asked if they would want some examples of the subgenres, and they and one other person did say they would appreciate that so I'm making this now. (Tagging them so that they can get this u/iamthewalrus999 u/maccartneylennon)

This is about in order of time period the style arised/dominated in. Also I won't be writing about latin jazz or afro-caribbean jazz because that is not my area at all.

Trad(itional) Jazz - This is one of the larger subgenres as it really just applies to any of the jazz of the early 20th century, the start of jazz. Sometimes called New Orleans Jazz because it has always been based out of that city, this music style is currently found mostly in bands or individuals that have come out of that city, and is really a realm of the music that is really not often talked about or found in just general jazz discussions, except when discussing history. Tubas and clarinets are not uncommon in this form of the music, while they are in other subgenres. Typically in this subgenre there are many horns playing lines over each other, sometimes fully orchestrated, but sometimes as a full collective improvisation. Note too that brass instruments had a much more prominent role than saxophones did, saxophones are mostly replaced by clarinets.

Examples: The Original Dixieland Jazz Band - St Louis Blues, Louis Armstrong - St James Infirmary, Sidney Bechet - Egyptian Fantasy

Swing - Swing came around in the 20s and was huge through the 20s and 30s in what is called the Swing era. This is when jazz was popular music, as it was the dance music of the time. This is also the time of the rise of the big band, a band with a bass, piano (and sometimes guitar), drums, and varying numbers of trumpets, trombones, and saxophones, though about 3-4 each, though its become more standard now to have more. This music has a real steady quick beat to it, and with so many horns tends to have some powerful horn lines written for them to play, since so much of the songs for this music are written and not improvised. Big bands are expensive and hard to manage though so the moment Swing started to fade just a bit lots of big bands had to shut down. At this point clarinets were still sometimes found in the music, though, by the later part of the swing era, it was mostly just sax players doubling on them. Note that not all swing was big bands though, many big band leaders had small bands they played with too.

Examples: Count Basie - Flight of the Foo Birds, Duke Ellington - Take the 'A' Train, Benny Goodman - Sing Sing Sing, Benny Goodman - Seven Come Eleven (example of small band swing)

Bebop - This is where we start to enter the type of music you hear about more on this sub and with other similar areas for jazz listeners. Bebop was the result of many things, but I'll just say Swing was starting to fade and small groups were taking its place that weren't making dance music, and those groups were the start of bebop. Because of WWII this music wasn't getting recorded as much at the start, so it was really just focused in New York without much of a public knowledge of it till half way through the decade. At this point the standard jazz instrumentation had been settled on, drums, bass, piano, 1 or 2 (at the time mostly 2) horns, typically a sax and a trumpet. This music showcased amazing skill from musicians, mostly horn players, where they took really fast amazing improvised solos over more difficult chords than before. Also just note that Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie are often viewed as the two founders of bebop if there had to be 2 chosen founders, and many revere Charlie Parker as one of if not the best players in regards to technique ever. Also heroin was getting to be a problem in the music world at this time, and many bebop musicians died early because of it, like Bird (Charlie Parker's nickname). Bebop kept going for awhile, it never really truly faded, it lost its dominance as the biggest subgenre but it never really had a big drop off like swing.

Examples: Charlie Parker - Blues for Alice, Dizzy Gillespie+Sonny Rollins+Sonny Stitt - On the Sunny Side of The Street, Charlie Parker - Donna Lee

Cool Jazz - Bebop's pretty quick so Cool Jazz countered that with more luscious slower or just overall more calm pieces. Started in the early 50s and kind of stayed around for the next decade, it was just a more calm relaxed form of the music, even when it's fast it's relaxed. 

Examples: Miles Davis - Jeru, Red Garland - A Foggy Day, Dave Brubeck - Take 5

Hard Bop - We've now reached the first subgenre that's one of my favorites. Hard Bop is jazz with a slight influence from the R&B and gospel of the 50s and early 60s. The drumming tends to be more aggressive, the solos are quite bluesy and hit hard, almost everybody in the group (groups tended to be 5-6 people) tended to solo, including the drums. This subgenre was really pushed forward by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, a group that lasted through the 80s, where the only constant member was Blakey, and all the alumni went on to be amazing players in their own right and further the subgenre. 

Examples: Art Blakey - Hammerhead, Art Blakey - Moanin, Lee Morgan - The Sidewinder

Modal - Modal jazz is defined in a way that is very clear for musicians to understand but doesn't really tend to make sense to non-musicians, even the name modal jazz, can't be explained without explaining some music theory, so I'll just say  that the songs are more open to allow soloists to have more space to explore their own voice and try different ways of approaching songs than the previous subgenres. Miles Davis pioneered this, listen to his album Kind of Blue, one of the most famous albums in all of jazz and certainly all of history to get a sense of what I'm talking about, that album truly pioneered modal jazz. Listen to the way that on a song like So What the difference in each of the 3 horns soloing is much larger than the difference in the solos of the horns on a hard bop or bebop song. This style started at the end of the 50s.

Examples: Miles Davis - So What (listen to all of Kind of Blue if interested in Modal Jazz, it's one of the harder subgenres to show with just one or two songs), Wayne Shorter - Footprints (not the Miles Davis release, we'll get to that), John Coltrane - My Favorite Things

Free Jazz - These are starting to get really hard to give examples of that convey the whole subgenre. Free Jazz is huge and has no strict definition. It started in 59 by Ornette Coleman and grew to just encompass any form of the music where there aren't set chords for the rhythm section to play. This pretty much means everybody is just free to play whatever they want. The early free jazz recordings tended to not have pianists. Don't enter this subgenre with too many preconceptions, and also don't assume any one song shows the entire genre. This stuff can range from absolute chaos (see Peter Brotzman's album Machine Gun) to absolutely serene beautiful music (see the Wayne Shorter Quartet's free-er pieces). 

Examples: Ornette Coleman - Lonely Woman, Cecil Taylor - Bemsha Swing, Ornette Coleman - Free Jazz (this is a full half hour album, however there are no individual songs on it, just one full half hour take)

Bossa Nova - I have to include this but I know very little about it. I'll keep this short and just say what I know for sure. It's brazilian, it's calm, often there are vocals, small groups, tends to be guitars.

Examples: Astrud Gilberto - Corcovado, Stan Getz+Joao Gilberto - The Girl From Ipanema

Spiritual Jazz - Finally, my favorite. This is a subgenre where the name spiritual jazz is not really the fully accepted codified term, but it works. This was late 60s through 70s stuff. Musicians who were getting really into the spiritual side of music were putting out this stuff, it tends to have pretty long songs, from 10 to 30 minutes. Often there is a lot of influence from the music of the continents of africa or asia. Typically this stuff can be pretty free, and could be called free jazz, but tends to have a different sound. Very powerful, the artists were always really trying to express something related to their spirituality. Also John Coltrane was really the first to push this stuff with A Love Supreme.

Examples: John Coltrane - A Love Supreme, John Coltrane - Ascension, Pharaoh Sanders - The Creator Has a Master Plan, Alice Coltrane - Turiya and Ramakrishna

Post Bop - Post Bop is 60s stuff, its similar to modal jazz but not quite. There's a lot of freedom in it, but it still has set chords and everything. Just the pianist might play some super weird voicings for chords, and just overall its just weird from a musicians perspective. The musicians are just kind of free to do weird stuff with the music. It tends to have a moderate tempo, and there's a lot of interaction between players in the bands. Miles Davis's second great quintet pioneered this music. 

Examples: Miles Davis - Footprints (from the album Miles Smiles), Herbie Hancock - Maiden Voyage, Wayne Shorter - Armageddon

Fusion - Another one of my favorites. Fusion is short for Jazz-Rock Fusion. In the late 60s and early 70s Jazz musicians started turning to heavy rock influenced music, mostly lead by Miles Davis's recordings In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew. The musicians from these albums (they each had tons of people on them, I can't remember exactly but above ten consistently) went on to found the big original fusion bands (I'll include one song from each of the groups I consider the large original fusion groups, and one Miles tune [except Herbie because he's coming up later, you'll see]). This was the first big shift in instrumentation in a while. Pianos were going to electric pianos and eventually synths. Guitars were shifting from the traditional jazz guitars to rock ones. Basses were shifting from double basses to electric basses, even fretless ones. Sometimes there were two drummers. Sometimes not horn players. Things were going crazy, and the jazz establishment was not happy, but the musicians shifting were because they were making tons of money.

Examples: The Mahavishnu Orchestra - Meeting of the Spirits, Weather Report - Black Market, Tony Williams Lifetime - Fred, Return to Forever - Spain, Miles Davis - Spanish Key

Jazz-Funk/Jazz-Funk fusion - This is sometimes looped in with jazz-rock fusion but the audience can be pretty different, so I split them up. Same as rock fusion but funk fusion instead. Herbie Hancock really helped push this one forward. 

Examples: Herbie Hancock - Chameleon, Freddie Hubbard - Red Clay, Art Ensemble of Chicago - Theme de Yoyo

Smooth Jazz - Most people don't think this is really jazz. I agree, it's not jazz, it's 80s pop with saxophones and jazz guitars. That doesn't mean it's bad, though most people nowadays do think so, just it really has very little connection to jazz. Might as well include it here because people may think it is jazz. Time period: 80s and 90s, has definitely died out, ask any high schooler who Kenny G is they have no idea. I should probably describe the music itself, it's super cheesy, most of the time slow electric piano backing lines that sound very ethereal playing behind saxophones and guitars. It can be super cheesy. Not always though, sometimes it's really nice. Just to be clear this is not a subgenre of jazz, I'm only including it because it often is mistaken as one.

Examples: Kenny G - Songbird, Kenny G - Going Home, Najee - Rendezvous, Together Again - Dave Koz

Neo-Bop - In the 80s and for a while on a bunch of young musicians came up who played music which was kind of like a mix of hard bop, modal jazz, bebop, cool jazz, all of those straight-ahead forms of the music and it's called neo-bop. Sadly there had to be this conflict back then between the no-bop people and the avant-garde and fusion people where most people were just doing there thing, but some people (Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis, Stanley Crouch, James Mtume, among others) attacked the other side's music, in some cases pretty harshly. Know that nowadays most people think the anti-fusion, avant-garde side is absurd. But neo-bop and that debate have kind of been tied in many peoples minds since then, even though many of those neo-bop musicians have also done some fusion or avant-garde stuff and don't care. This is also just called contemporary straight ahead jazz sometimes. 

Examples: Roy Hargrove - The Stinger, Wynton Marsalis - Black Codes, Nicholas Payton - A Touch of Silver

The new jazz-hip hop-r&b fusion thing that's happening mostly in LA - I came up with that name if you couldn't tell, but there's this thing going on in LA that doesn't really have name yet but it's been mostly black musicians incorporating elements of modern black musical culture with jazz. 

Examples: Robert Glasper - Maiden Voyage/Everything in it's Right Place, Esperanza Spalding - I Know You Know, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIZ6l-mVHVg) of a bunch of the LA folks playing the Miles Davis song Nardis mixed with the Kendrick Lamar song Untitled 05.

Finally I have to get to two people who are so unique I know that I and at least a few other people I know treat them as their own subgenre. Sorry if you feel I left people out, or if these two should be in certain subgenres but you're wrong.

Charles Mingus - Mingus is known mostly as a composer, though he was also an amazing bass player. He wrote some really unique music, often very deeply rooted in blues, traditional jazz, and other black music, while also having deep connections in the western classical tradition. He often composed for very specific ensembles, which is part of what makes him so unique. 

Examples: Moanin (not Blakey's song of the same name, his), The Fisherman's Wife Has Some Jive-Ass Slippers, The Original Fables of Faubus

Thelonious Monk - He was a pianist who I don't know how to describe, very unique, played in what is technically the bebop tradition a lot of the time, but I had to separate him because of his unique style. Very interesting way of approaching the piano. I've heard it said he was like a child and a wise sage at the same time, at least in the way he played.

Examples: Monk's Dream, Straight no Chaser, Japanese Folk Song

Wow that took a few hours, but it was really fun. I apologize for any mistakes, and I hope this serves some people well. I'll definitely be linking this to people a lot, I hope other people use it as a resource like that too.

Edit: This blew up even bigger than I thought it would. I'm getting a lot of recommendations, and some I told people I'd include, but there are just too many, and I don't care anymore, the post is imperfect and I'm fine with that. If you feel your person, your subgenre, or your whatever was treated unfairly, that's fine, write it in the comments, but I'm not changing this post anymore. It took a few hours to make yesterday, and I'm not planning on spending another hour making it just right for everybody. I'm proud of my work and if I do something like this again I'll learn from your feedback. It's way higher quality than 99% of the shit I post on this website. Edit: top of r/jazz, wasn't expecting this. 

After a long time of looking at and listening to this song as a novice I finally get what is happening. 

Start on C# as a 2-5-1 the 1 is now the 3 to a 3-5-1 do the same for this new 1. Rest. Repeat on A. Then 4 2-5-1's (F A C# F). 

Move whole thing back two chords (one measure) so that you start on the third chord. 

The chords go Minor, dominant, major, than alternate dominant major till rest if necessary. 

I am very happy I finally figured out the pattern. Next comes soloing which'll be interesting. 

I just wanted to say how great this was because I won't be around any other musicians for a while. **Personnel**:

Joel Ross - Vibraphone

Immanuel Wilkins - Alto Saxophone

Jeremy Corren - Piano

Ben Tibiero - Bass

Jeremy Dutton - Drums

Gretchen Parlato - Vocals (Track 8)

\----

**From the Blue Note Website**:

At the heart of it all is the wisdom passed down personally to Ross from Hutcherson: “Write music about your life and write every day.”

“I took Bobby's words literally,” says Ross, who visited the master in his home while studying in California. “Every song is influenced by people or events, relationships I had, or even a question someone posed.” 11 of the KingMaker’s 12 tracks were composed by Ross, and from the cover photo to the music within, the album finds him exploring the formative stuff that made him the man he is, first and foremost, family. The centerpiece and title track is dedicated to his mother, while other compositions pay homage to Ross’ twin brother, father, and niece.

**From the Liner Notes**:

I began to feel that I had been spending so much time exploring the upper atmosphere of music and the more ethereal kind of far-out spacey stuff. Now there was this need to take some more of the earth and to feel a little more tethered; a connection to the earth. ... I was beginning to feel that we (the sextet) were playing this heavy kind of music, and I was tired of everything being heavy. I wanted to play something lighter. - Herbie Hancock

-I'm a vibraphonist, and I have weird relationship with my instrument. The more time I spend with my instrument, the more I hate it, and the more time away on other instruments, the more I love it. No other instrument is like this for me. I know that the vibes are somewhat controversial, some people love the vibes, and think they are really cool and unique, some people think they sound cheesy and emotionless. So I'm interested, what are your thoughts on the vibes? "

So it's not all just cobwebs and bats.I mean, I only took the trash out, but still. I was outside! Gods, I feel so happy having gotten over such a major fear of mine.

I have seen the fan art that Paolini said was roughly accurate and the creator said he was meant to be around 800 feet (243,84 meter). Paolini also linked a post that said he was 300 meters. Are that all the sources on his length and the reason that length is commonly used or did I miss something?I read the ""Malus Darkblade"" novel series a few years ago and really enjoyed them. I do think however that his death (as in how he died) during the end times was a bit of a shame. Do you think there's a good chance he will return along with Malekith's shadow elves? I really hope so, he was my favourite character and no character is AoS has been able to fill the void of his absence.Hi everyone. I have a close friend who is one of my few acquaintances who likes comics. One of the comics we both like is Spider-Man, though she is more interested in the relationships of the characters than I am. Since “Back to the Basics” (especially since ASM 29) she thinks it is really likely that Peter and MJ will get married again and this greatly exictes her. While I am all for the marriage (believing she is THE love interest of Peter) and maybe throwing OMD in the trash where it belongs, I am not so certain. While I think it would be a lame cop-out to tease it again and then not go through with it, with Quesada still in power and the Bat/Cat wedding in recent memory, I can’t quite share her optimism. However, I am no expert on the Spider-Man comics (I am more of a fanboy of the symbiotes), so I wondered what the consensus of the community is. So, what are your thoughts?Hi everyone.

[Fact sheet](http://www.kitfoxgames.com/press/sheet.php?p=dwarf_fortress)!

Dwarf Fortress is coming to Steam and itch.io, published by Kitfox Games!

***TL;DR***

1. Why Steam/itch? *Health difficulties, uncertain structure of Patreon.*
2. Can I still get the original game free and is it still going to be updated? *Yep!*
3. Why Kitfox Games? *We're friends and helping to handle marketing & customer support.*
4. Are you going to steal any mods? *No!! We're creating an all new tileset, and no one has to have their mods on Steam Workshop.*
5. I don't want to support this version! *Okay, you can still support Tarn (“the Toady One”) and Zach (“Threetoe”) on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bay12games) and [PayPal](http://www.bay12games.com/support.html)!*

This is just another way to support the Dwarf Fortress creators!

-----------

***ALL THE DETAILS***

>*Why is Dwarf Fortress on Steam and itch.io now?*

Dwarf Fortress is going premium because **some of their close family members have developed serious health issues within the past 6 months, and money to support them is tight**. As it's a sensitive and difficult matter, please respect Tarn and Zach's privacy about this, but keep some well wishes in your hearts for them.❤️

Due to these rising healthcare costs, as well as the [uncertain structure of Patreon](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/crowd-funding-platform-patreon-announces-it-will-pay-out-half-a-billion-dollars-to-content-creators-in-2019.html), they decided it was time for them to have additional means of support.

>*What’s special about this version?*

For the moment, Tarn and Zach will continue working first on the major villains update for Dwarf Fortress Classic (or, if you prefer, Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress Classic), and getting that stable, before they move on to graphics-related support for the Steam/itch.io premium version.

The premium version will have a few special features like graphics by default, the Steam Workshop, and auto-updates.

>*Can I still play Dwarf Fortress for free?*

Yes!

You will still be able to get Dwarf Fortress Classic for free, same as always! And it’ll still be updated alongside the new premium versions (just without the new art, music, and Steam features), forever.

>*Who owns Dwarf Fortress now?*

Nobody bought or sold anything. Bay 12 Games always has and always will (as far as we know) own Dwarf Fortress and all of its branding and properties. Kitfox is only entitled to a portion of revenue from Steam and itch.io.

>*Who’s doing the art and music?*

You may already be familiar with the tile set mod packs from **Michał “Mayday” Madej** and **Patrick  Martin “Meph” Schroeder**. They’re collaborating on an all-new, from-scratch tileset, as seen in the teaser trailer and screenshots. Meanwhile, [Dabu](https://www.dabuaudio.com/) has composed a few musical tracks, to match the seasons, and some other audio bits and pieces. We hope the easy-to-use Steam Workshop will allow there to eventually be even more mods than ever before.

**However, nobody’s mods will be included in the Steam or itch.io versions.** Not even Meph’s. **After the villains update is out and stable,** Tarn and Meph will work on the Steam Workshop pipeline to make sure anyone who wants to can easily bring over their mods, if they want to.

If you prefer your old mod packs, feel free to keep using those. They will continue to be compatible with Dwarf Fortress Classic. 

>*I love Dwarf Fortress and just want to support its creators! What is the best way?*

[Donation](http://www.bay12games.com/support.html) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bay12games) are always going to be the best way to get money directly to Tarn & Zach. If you want access to the Steam and itch.io features, 80% of that purchase will also go to them.

>*What’s changing about the game to make it “fit” Steam and itch.io?* 

Nothing. It’s still Dwarf Fortress. A few bells and whistles won’t change that. Graphics will make it easier for some people to play and Steam Workshop will make it easier for more people to use mods. The gameplay will remain the same across both Steam/itch.io and Classic versions. 

>*Should I use the old forum or Discord or what???*

Tarn and Zach won’t be changing how they do things, so the old [Bay 12 Games forum](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/) (or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bay12Games)) is best for talking to them. For chatting with other fans, Kitfox recommends the [new official Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/kitfoxgames), but it’s fine to stick with whatever community you are comfortable with. This is the beginning of a new era with lots of new players, so things might shift around a bit.

ABOUT KITFOX

>*Who is [Kitfox Games](https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames), anyway?*

Oh hey there! We’re a small indie studio (8 people) in Montreal, Canada. We’ve made other games like  [Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, and the upcoming Boyfriend Dungeon. We’ve also published The Shrouded Isle and the upcoming Six Ages.](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/kitfoxgames)

>*Why work with Kitfox Games?* 

Tarn and Zach wanted more people to know about Dwarf Fortress, and didn’t want to spend a lot of time dealing with Steam and journalists and so on. They want to make video games, including more Dwarf Fortress, and not be hassled with selling and negotiating and so on. So Kitfox is acting as a publisher to help with marketing, Steam/itch.io logistics, and paying for other needs like artist contracts, music, PAX booths, etc. 

Steam/itch.io and Kitfox will get cuts of the sales on those platforms, so if you want to give MAXIMUM money to Tarn and Zach, [direct donation](http://www.bay12games.com/support.html) is the way to go. 

Kitfox has no access to the source code, and will have no influence on the design, programming, or updates to Dwarf Fortress. The point of the whole endeavour is to Tarn and Zach focus on the game development, not distract or change what they’re doing.

After Steam/Itch.io’s cut, Kitfox will receive 20% of each sale, which is a lower percentage than most publishers, leaving 80% for Bay 12 Games. 

>*How do you all know each other?*

Tanya (Kitfox’s Captain) met Tarn some years ago through mutual indie friends (thanks Kepa!), and found they had a lot of interests in common. Okay, mostly procedural generation and indie games, but also cats and mythology. They’ve been on multiple PAX [panels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9pc8li4fuQ) and edited [2 books about procedural generation](https://www.crcpress.com/Procedural-Generation-in-Game-Design/Short-Adams/p/book/9781498799195) together.

Before meeting Tarn, Tanya took a class from a friend on how to play Dwarf Fortress (hi Joachim!) and was inspired by the experience to keep exploring the weird, wonderful world of procedural systems. So when Tarn said he was worried about healthcare and Patreon, she offered to help. We hope it all works out! :)

PabloPeublo,7,9,"What changes with the USSR facing invasion simultaneously from the east and west, and with the USA strictly still only in a supply role and not directly at war with the axis?What are the most mysterious and intriguing lesser known unsolved cases you know from non western countries/Africa, Asia and Latin America?

Here’s a couple I’ve heard of

**The Kharkiv Beheadings**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_beheadings

>The Kharkiv beheadings was a crime committed in 2012 in Ukraine, in which a judge and his family were beheaded with a machete. The judge, Vladimir Trofimov, his wife Irina, their son Sergei, and the son's girlfriend were attacked in the eastern Ukraine city of Kharkiv on December 15, 2012. The judge was attacked at his family home. The bodies were all left at the scene, minus their heads. It was reported the judge, his wife, and son's partner were killed first, then beheaded, while the son was beheaded while still alive.

>Police stated that the motive for the murders was either revenge or theft. Trofimov, 58, had worked as a magistrate and judge for more than 30 years, and was a noted antiques collector. The attack came on a celebration day for judges in Ukraine. The case was described as one of the most shocking to emerge from the former Soviet Union in the international media, with many commentators using the case to spotlight the flawed Ukrainian judicial system.

**The Setagaya family murder**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setagaya_family_murder

>The Setagaya family murder (世田谷家事件, Setagaya-ka jiken) refers to the unsolved murders of the Miyazawa family in Setagaya ward of Tokyo, Japan, on 30 December 2000.

>Mikio Miyazawa, Yasuko Miyazawa, Niina Miyazawa and Rei Miyazawa were murdered during a home invasion at night by an unknown assailant who then remained in the Miyazawas' house for several hours before disappearing. Japanese police launched a massive investigation that uncovered the killer's DNA and many specific clues about their identity, but the perpetrator has never been identified.

The crazy thing about that case to me is that 

A) the killer spent up to TEN HOURS hanging around the house after he killed the entire family. using the family computer, consuming barley tea, melon, and ice cream from their refrigerator, using their toilet, treating his injuries using first aid kits and other sanitary products, and taking a nap on a sofa in the second floor living room. An analysis of Mikio Miyazawa's computer revealed that it had connected to the internet the morning after the murders at 1:18 a.m. and again at around 10 a.m., around the time Yasuko's mother Asahi entered the house and discovered the murders.

And

B) the police know so much information about the suspect. They have his DNA, they have his fingerprints, they know his blood type is A from when he bled as he was injured. They have an idea of his unique mixed ethnicity for the area. They even know what his meal before the attack was from the stool he left in the toilet. And yet, nobody has been identified. No databases, domestic or international contained anything linking his fingerprints or DNA to a person. So for whoever did this, it was either their first and last crime, or they’re incredibly lucky and/or careful and somehow have never left DNA or fingerprints at any other crime scene, and for some reason were just exceedingly careless at this one in particular 

Are there any non western mysterious crimes and murders you know of?"

Tyler11223344,3,9,".....just like every GT student on the insideHey guys, first post here though I've been jealously lurking for a while.

While I've always been a hoarder in that I never delete anything I don't absolutely have to, I'm (unfortunately) not a hoarder with 60TB of storage and all that awesome stuff.

&nbsp;

But for the actual question, I'm wondering how/what to do to start with Network accessed storage.
Currently I have my desktop PC with an SSD and 2 x 2TB HDDs all plugged into SATA, but I'm running out of SATA poets and rather than invest in PCI SATA cards, I want to look into network accessed instead. At the moment I'm looking for adding an extra 2TB of storage, but I also hopefully want to expand in the future, so any solutions with possibilities for adding extra hard drives down the road would be great.

I have a few mid/low end desktops from family that ""broke"" and ended up with me after they got new ones (All of which were somewhat easy fixes). And they're certainly not servers, but they have free SATA ports and I'm not using them for anything. I was wondering if I could configure them to provide decently fast network storage, or if I'd need more specialized hardware to provide acceptably fast speeds.

Sorry for rambling, but I guess my concise question is can/how should I, configure some excess desktops for this, and if not, what would you recommend to setup something basic.

For my network setup, I'm a college student using a Ethernet switch to plug my devices into the network. However (And I haven't looked into this enough to determine if this is feasible yet), I was considering getting an Ethernet card for my desktop and  setting up a second LAN network for only me, connecting the desktop to both networks to completely isolate file transfer traffic to a separate network.

Also, I have copies of Windows Server from my college, which I currently have the desktops running (For personal testing/learning, not running anything critical) if any recommendations include that.


Wow okay that was a lot longer than I meant to write...


Tl;dr: Looking into network storage, the 3rd and 5th paragraphs are the main question, with additional info in the rest of the post



Thanks for any help in advance guys, and sorry if there's a different Subreddit dedicated to questions I should post in

moosecliffwood,10,7,"[removed]I am located in Shelby County, Tennessee. My boyfriend and I are breaking up. We live in a home that was owned by his mother, who is recently deceased. It is willed to him and his older brother. My children (from a previous marriage) and I moved into the home in April of this year. I do not pay rent (I pay the electricity bill that is in his name and make all home-related purchases) and we have never had any sort of tenancy agreement. All of my mail goes to this home, my driver's license shows this address, and my children are registered for school at the home (via notarized affidavit of shared residency that he and I both signed in July).

1. Is he legally allowed to force me to relinquish my key with no notice?
2. Is he legally allowed to put all of my belongings on the curb (approximately 90% of the furniture in the home was purchased solely by me. He has been unemployed since April and has no income, so all food and home-related purchases are also made by me).
3. If these things are not legal, can someone point me in the direction of a source that I can shown him? I work full-time and am pregnant and exhausted and I really cannot face having to spend the weekend being screamed at while I scramble to get all my things out. If it's possible to get more time to do so, that would be ideal.
4. Any related advice would be more than welcome.My dad was adopted as a baby and all I ever knew about his bio parents was the dad's first name. I got my results today and not only found his parents, but FIVE younger full siblings! I am talking to a new first cousin and getting photos of these people who look just like my dad and my mind is blown. My ancestry results were boring in comparison to this! (Apparently I am the whitest white girl to ever live lol.)

This is way, way cooler than I ever expected. Tonight, I finished C25K. Technically. Which I hate having to add. I finished the time-based version. But running for 30 minutes gets me 2 miles. And instead of feeling ecstatic that I can run 30 minutes (when I started I could barely run the circular section of a cul-de-sac), I feel utter disappointment that it's nowhere near a 5K. 

I know improving my distance will improve my speed. And I know that continuing to lose weight will too (I've got 80 lbs. to go). But I just feel shitty. I don't even want to tell anyone in real life that I finished C25K because I feel like it's not really true. It's got a big fat asterisk.

Ugh."

I have a large flat surface I need to bond something to and will be using E6000 to do so. There is a high chance of squeeze out and the surface is slightly porous, it's also floppy so it needs to be supported from behind (laying on concrete floor). I'll be using bricks as clamps to keep pressure on the items. 

What can I put on to the floor to where it won't bond to? Or will it not bond to concrete? Thin mil plastic drop ""cloth""? Wax paper? Trash bags?

Edit: Wax paper worked a treat. The parts where the glue had direct contact with the wax paper took a little care to remove, but any squeeze out through the fabric took zero effort to remove."
EmeraldFlight,1,9,"I'm big into connotations. I'm of the mind, in fact, that a misconnoted word will ruin a passage completely. I wanted to use these as an example of connotation in writing.

- Gleam: Something ""gleaming"" is flat or reflective, constant, and has connotations of pristineness, power, and/or individuality. You can say ""a thousand eyes gleamed at me from the darkness"" - power - or ""her new dress gleamed"" - pristineness, individuality, and a focus on the singular. This is where ""gleam"" fits best.

- Glimmer: Something that ""glimmers"" is usually putting out light rather than reflecting it, and usually isn't as steady as ""gleam."" Like ""the ring glimmered at the bottom of the pool"" - the light is obstructed by pool water. Therefore, ""glimmer"" has connotations of concealment or weakness.

- Glisten: Something that ""glistens"" is generally particular - made up of or concerning particles. Sweat glistens, as does dew and tears. Eyes only glisten when they're emotional, and items only glisten when it's rained recently. As such, 'glisten' has more softly emotional connotations - it can even put a softly emotional edge on sweat, which is gross. It can be argued that sexualizing sweat with ""glisten"" is an exception.

- Glitter: Something that ""glitters"" is *refracting* light, not just reflecting it. Gems glitter more than anything else, and eyes glitter when they're excited. Thus, ""glitter"" connotes extravagance, expensiveness, and the like. If tears ""glitter,"" they're [pretty tears.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparklingStreamOfTears)

- Glint: Something ""glinting"" is sinister in one way or another. When animals hunt their prey, their eyes ""glint;"" so do knives held above the main character. It's also a very subtle way to make something intimidating; rather than a lake ""gleaming,"" it ""glints."" That'll leave an attentive reader wondering about why the lake is so spooky.

Same goes for other kinds of word choice; before using ""grasp"" over ""grab"" or ""clasp,"" think and research their connotations. Sometimes, this comes naturally, but other times it's more difficult. In fact, noticing myself choose ""gleam"" over ""glimmer"" inspired me to post this. Hopefully I didn't ruin the sound ""gl"" for you."

c00kies44,8,2,"For clarification, this means that instead of having the occasional good day, you have the occasional bad day.I tend to get shit done when pressure is on, so I gave myself a deadline to have something change in my life, to have some meaning in my life. I gave myself until next Valentine's day, as that should be enough time for change, but also not too far away that I don't do anything.

I do feel guilty, especially when I see my parents, but I know it's unrealistic to be able to continue on like this for much longer. 137 days to go! Wish me luck!I thought of this while reminiscing about the gift I wasn't able to give my gf (she dumped me before I could give it to her). It was a drawing I made of her late dad with angels, a heart, and a nice saying on it. I was going to pair it up with a jar of pickles (I compared her to a pickle when I told her how I felt about her) so that it wasn't just a serious gift. This is by far the nicest gift I would've given anyone.Would it make it easier to seek treatment or help? Would just having the money make things better for you by removing stresses (debts, bills, ability to move out, etc...)? Would it make you feel like less of a burden (you can treat others instead of always the other way around)? 

For myself, I feel like money would only help by allowing me to move out, and feel like less of a loser. However, my main problem is not having people to spend money with, so I don't think it would help me that much, but I'm curious about how it would impact everyone else's lives.Pikachu pique peak peek at you"

milshake,4,10,"bae was so cute

I couldn't even compute

the parabolic curve

of dat booty, so swerveSo I posted this question in /r/AndroidQuestions, but I thought asking in this sub as well would be appropriate. 

I have a Sprint LG G2 (LS980), which was rooted and had the CloudyG2 2.2 ROM.

I wanted to flash the CloudyG2 3.3 ROM, so I started by installing AutoRec for my G2. I followed the prompts in the app and pressed something along the lines of ""to Recovery"", which rebooted my phone to show the TWRP screen.
From there, I wasn't quite sure what to do, so I tried to do a System Reboot, but that only ended up with a boot screen saying ""Security error"". I was able to enter the TWRP screen again, where I tried wiping my phone to resolve the issue, and I tried to reboot to system again, which then showed a prompt asking if I wanted to root my phone and install SuperSU, since TWRP detected that the phone was apparently not rooted. I thought my previous wipe might have done something with the root, so I decided to agree to rooting my phone again just in case.

After this, my phone got stuck in a boot loop, and after half an hour I decided that it isn't supposed to take this long. 

So now, my phone won't boot, HOWEVER, I am able to reach the TWRP screen. Is there anything I can do from there to fix this problem?

I'm sorry if this is a really rookie mistake, I'm not that familiar with how Android works.I have a LS980 that was unlocked and had the CloudyG2 2.2 rom, and I just flashed the updated CloudyG2 3.3 rom today. 

I tried to use *#*#4636#*#* to change the radio band to GSM instead of Sprint's CDMA, because the SIM I was using with it previously is a GSM network, but I get a note saying ""This application does not work on this device"" when I attempt to go to Phone info to change the radio band! 

When I first got my phone with CloudyG2 2.2 from the previous owner I bought it from, I was able to use this method to successfully change the radio band, but now it isn't working.

Did I mess up the unlock somehow? Is there any way to fix this?Cooldown is 5 minutes! But will it last, or are we being bamboozled :'(I recently downloaded the Dogecoin-QT client, and it took a pretty substantial amount of time for it to sync the entire block chain, and when I sync after I wake up it takes some time to sync with the transactions that occurred overnight. What's going to happen as more and more transactions happen, and the block chain gets bigger and bigger? Will new shibes just have to deal with the giant wait as it syncs? "

Incognition369,8,1,"Sorry if I'm being overly simplistic in my principles but wouldn't the market dictate how much modification to the internet people were willing to pay for? Is there any way the market can do *better* than the government?So, during this Lenten season I decided I wanted to try spending less time on my phone. I am writing this on my laptop. I am just trying to be more social, even online, in a healthier way, and I spend almost every waking second of the day staring as my phone, either on reddit or youtube. I hardly ever get on facebook on my phone. I rarely open my browser. It's just reddit, youtube, and a language learning app. 
On top of that, while I don't look at porn all the time, nowadays it's almost 100% through my phone. 
So I'm trying to train my brain to not automatically go to the phone when i have a moment of silence. I'm deleting apps that make me want to use my phone more.
I'm getting on the computer more, and I'm being more objective about what i do on reddit and facebook.My wife is overweight and into a lot of different diet trends and such. pretty much if somebody is doing something different with food on YouTube she knows about it. I think this is probably part of her upbringing, since it seems that her parents are also somewhat into fad diets.

I on the other hand have been training for the military and I am probably at my peak fitness in several years and I'm continually improving and I'm at the lowest weight that I've been in probably five years. 

My wife is really making an effort to exercise more, but I think she has some bad eating habits. I generally don't say anything because I don't want to put her down and she's really sensitive about this stuff comma but I think she has some sort of obsession with food which is why she is always looking at these different diets or intermittent fasting. 

How should I respond to her when she insists that I try some new diet because of what one doctor said on YouTube? I'm just really frustrated, because it's not like I got fit without trying. I pay attention to what I eat. I exercise regularly. I just have some basic health principles that I try to stick to. I'm sure she means well and wants to help, but it's...I don't what word to use to express how I feel. Frankly, it's a fat person telling a fit person how to get fit. It makes me a little angry, because she's telling me to do all these things that she's not even doing so much and if she were it would probably be disastrous or short-lived at best.

**tl;dr:** My overweight diet enthused wife keeps giving me health and diet and fitness while I'm at my best fitness in the past five years and improving. What do I do?Sometimes I fantasize about infiltrating a white supremacist group, and after wooing some girl with my white superiority rhetoric, having sex with her. Right when she's about to climax I'll whisper in her ear ""I'm a Jew"" them hump as far as I can to climax inside her.I moved to a ""land of opportunity"" so to speak only a couple weeks ago, and partly out of a desperate hunger, and partly just to prove i'd do anything I just walked into a restaurant the day I got here and said I'd do anything they had for me to do. They hired me as a dish washer. 

There are so many jobs out there in this city and I've made some professional connections. I have some money set aside. I'm staying with family right now and they said I could stay for a while if I found work (otherwise I don't know what I'm going to do). 

I'm 28, with a college education, and I just can't wash dishes anymore. It was fun when i was 17, but now, not so much. 

Anyway, should I just quit this job and redirect my focus toward actually getting something of substance. I *feel* like i'm nuts to stay there, but I realize that I'm just *feeling* and not really thinking right now.

and, yeah, yeah, I know all jobs are a blessing, and I have respect for people of all walks of life, but I have a skill set that I'm not using or even seeking to use when I'm working there.I know people in HR personally and I deal with them a lot professionally, and the more I am aquatinted with them the more I'm disturbed by the nature of their job, and the general attitude it propagates, viewing fellow human beings as nothing more than machinery. That's another, though somewhat related issue. 

If federal bureaucracy and regulations were thrown out the window what place would there be for HR?I'm mixed Jewish/Christian. I think it's like to get a degree in religious studies because, since I'm not not a member of any Christian organization, I think I may have more objectivity in the matter. Nevertheless, I still would like to find a church to be a part of. I'm still observant Jewish, but I love Christians and I love Jesus. 

I'm not a fan of Protestant churches. The term alone indicates that they are excluding themselves from The Body of believers. I think between the Catholics and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches,I lean a little more toward the latter two. However, while I was attending one I realized that if I was to be entirely dedicated to living like them I would have to abandon my observance of G-d's holidays and commandments as I have been observing them for years. I still keep kosher and observe Shabbat, and I find support in the Christian bible to do it.

Please don't suggest the Messianics. Nice people, but most of them are really Protestant, and most if their theology is Protestant. 

TL;Dr - I'm Jewish and looking for a non-Protestant church but don't want to abandon my Jewish observance.I've picked up a few gigs freelancing over the past few years, but haven't landed anything long-term. I'm trying to join the military right now but won't find out for a couple months. I just moved to a new area and I'm job hunting. I'm also doing a lot of traveling this year. Anyway on a whim I was checking out the STCBOK, because I did some work for them in college about six years ago. I saw they had a membership which hooked you up with other writers and gave you access for job postings and such. 

It's $280 for the membership and I just don't know if I will be able to pick up any short term projects for it to be with it. Any suggestions?

Update: wow! Thanks for all the immediate responses! And sorry for the errors."
highsocietymedia,6,9,"So, last week I finally received a promotion at work that they had been promising me for about 5 months. The promotion comes with about a $12k per year salary increase.

  


Then yesterday, I got an offer from a competing company for a job that pays about $10k more than the promotion I just got.

  


I like my current company, and don't want to screw them over, but I also feel like it would be crazy to turn down that much money. Would I be an asshole for jumping ship after they promoted me?Congrats to Maye.  Was hoping my Bucs would scoop him up, but I'll still root for him all the same.Irma, you's a bitch."

Drag0nV3n0m231,3,6,"I play the game quite a lot, but since getting battlepacks is random, i rarely get any. I think this could be a great change, even though they're only skins.

Edit: i was thinking, the quality of pack you get could be loosely based off of how well you do maybe.I haven’t seen many people here say this; most people praise it for being “smooth” and looking great and feeling good.

But my experience has been completely different.

I haven’t been playing too long, but it just feels terrible, even compared to 4’s which is also not the best, at least you know about what you’re going to do in 4, where in unity nothing is consistent 

Sometimes, you need to hold free run up to start climbing, but other times, you don’t. Sometimes you need to hold it to continue going up a tower, but other times you just leap up. 

The jumping is painfully inconsistent and the animations are the same. Why am I able to make some of these jumps? Fuck if I know, my character just gets propelled forward at the speed of light when I want to jump to something far. Sometimes you hop a foot forward, sometimes 10 feet.

The direction you move is based on the camera, but only sometimes. If my camera is tilted to the right, and I’m holding up, the character will climb up and to the right, despite me only holding up. Sometimes, holding up will actually make you go up. It’s not consistent. Similarly to this, if I’m climbing up something the wrong way and move the opposite way to compensate, you sometimes randomly leap to the closest thing.

The animations are baffling. Why do I swing my feel up a steep roof instead of just finishing climbing up? It’s certainly slower, and you’re locked into the animation. 

Other random problems: you can’t back eject if you hold the button, even if you’re sitting still, you need to tap, and even then it only works half the time.

Maybe it’s because I haven’t played with it enough, but I just don’t get how anyone can find this remotely satisfying. Half the time I’m running on a roof I end up gliding from chimney to chimney because the games jump is so inconsistent it just pushes you to whatever it decides at the moment you should reach, it’s terrible, and worse, it’s inconsistent. 

Please someone explain why you enjoy it so much, because it’s just painful to me, it makes me want to stop playing when I’m trying to climb on a light fixture and end up swinging off it because the game is inconsistent.This is by far my biggest issue with any paid content in this game. The attachments 3arc puts on the blueprints suck, obviously people will change them, but when you do half the aesthetics of the skin disappear because it’s tied to the attachments. 

Can we please get the skins applied to every attachment or at least make the blueprint a facade for the gun where attachments won’t show up and it just looks like the blueprint? I’m tired of getting cool blueprints and then half the skin not being visible because I don’t need the damn bruiser grip"

I took my cymbalta with breakfast and went about my day, a short while later i started to feel a bit dizzy and went to lay down and wait for it to blow over. About 20 minutes later i started to feel the room spin, and i assumed these were just normal side effects, until the spinning progressed until it felt like i was being flung through space and time and the only thing that brought any relief was slightly pressing on my eyes for some reason. i laid in bed for a while with my legs kicking every few seconds until i felt the urge to vomit. after that I had a panic attack, and shuffled around my kitchen seething for some reason until i had to vomit again. i then started just staring into space, i couldnt focus on anything (mentally or physically), my vision was blurry, and all i could seem to do was stare, that was until i vomited a third time. Thankfully, this was the last time i vomited, and after that I went to lay down again. Things got worse at this point, i kept sort of falling asleep and then id suddenly be aware again, but my surroundings felt entirely alien for a moment, like I didnt know where i was. at one point I remember looking at my pupils in the bathroom mirror and they were enormous, I didnt sleep any real amount and still havent, I am currently still fairly dizzy, feel off, and my pupils are still dilated. From what ive read here the side effects from cymbalta can be pretty intense, but my reaction seems extreme, and I took a single 30mg dose ~36 hours ago. anyone know wtf happened to me?I found this pin about 2 years ago, I've spent hours trying to figure out what the pin was for, and was never able to figure it out.

So much of my time has been used up by this game, and so much of yours will too,very addicting, very dangerous.Overall, I don't think anybody should be angry with the T10 lightanks... The majority of them are actually pretty good IMO. But there are a few things I have a problem with in the American line...

•WG nerfed the guns ALOT (taking off auto loaders and derp guns, as well as making them a lot less accurate on all Nations... As if light tanks needed less carrying capability) This makes it so Light tanks won't see the light in T8 Teambattles, Strongholds, and Clanwars.

•The T49 no longer has a derp gun... This is honestly one of the stupedest changes WG has made.  The whole point of the T49 IRL (A M41 bulldog chassis and Sheridan turret) was to test out the capabilities of the gun to be mounted on the Sheridan.  So what's the point of even having it in the game if all it gets is M41 gun?

•The M41 bulldog can only have the crappy single shot gun now... I don't think it is even a shadow of its former self... This also takes away from the identity of the American light tank line, zoom and boom guns/ autoloaders on the slower side of all light tanks

So I would recommend WG just move the Americans light tanks up one tier and leave it at that, then give the Sheridan an upgraded T49 gunI think this may be make or break for me whether I'll get this ship or not.  I would like to know if it will be able to refine it on the on-ship refineries, and if it's any different from the standard ship fuel.

Thanks in advanceI know there have been a few posts about this already, but here are my thoughts, I think there should be some sort of radius around supply drops and obilisks, and infinitely vertically. Not having access to them makes it impossible to escape an abusive tribe/ server and slows down gameplay by not having access to BP'sRight now I only have a couple pistols, a few survival rifles, an incendiary launcher and a SMG .  3/5 colonists just died to tribal attacks one after another... Which weapons should I get, and which should I avoid? The LMG, Charge Rifle, and Snipers look good on wiki.  But I'm playing on permadeath and cant afford losing more colonistsIthink it may have an ability to fluff out its feathers to make its self appear larger.  [This would explain its crazy fluffiness compared to the dossier.](https://imgur.com/gallery/oRDuM) The dossier also mentions a scream that makes opposing Dino's frightened.  The 'fluffing-up' may also help spook the Dino's when paired with the scream. "

How many times have we seen someone asking on here which phone is better because the naming conventions confuse people? https://twitter.com/sarvikas/status/1072776417601966080?s=09Hi r/vita I’ve just pulled my OG vita to see if it’s still kicking. It’s still glorious.

Except for one game breaking bug (not a feature). 

At some point a sticky liquid has been spilling on the buttons, it was cleaned off straight away and seemed to work fine but now it feels slightly sticky. Not much but enough to be a problem on the games I want to play.

I looked up a FAQ to open it up to clean it off. It looks pretty difficult. 

Does anyone have any experience of this, is it a clean up job with some alcohol or replace the button set. And is it worth trying myself, I can’t see there being many specialists, I’m unsure about taking it to one of these repair shops which specialise in phones as they’ve likely never touched a vitaI didn't jump on the Hitman 1 train until the Bangkok pack came out, for Hitman 2 it wasn't until after Christmas and with Hitman 3 I've only just bought it reduced on PSN. 



I'm an idiot thrice over, should have bought this day one.

Mostly my delay was being a little burned out, I've ploughed over 270 hours into the first two games. Not that I didn't enjoy my time with those games, I just needed to switch it up. 


But wow H3 is a very different game in some ways, I just finished my first playthrough and maybe it's the cut scenes being back, perhaps it's the news of IOIs next project biasing my views but this feels so much like a James Bond game. 


It really hit home after I sniped two targets in Mendoza, waltzed over to the dancefloor and tangoed the night away. But then that final mission, couldn't get more Bond than shooting the fuck out of a bad guys former KGB base. So much fun and so surprising given shooting is not this game series strength. You could see Daniel Craig being swapped out for 47 and Judi Dench stepping into Diana's shoes.



I cannot wait for their bond game. Hopefully next time I won't be an idiot and buy on day one.



NB side query, is this game easier than the previous two? On my first go I've suit only silent assassin Dartmoor and Berlin, suit only China and Mendoza. I don't think I was ever that good on the first two, or have I just got the mechanics of the gameplay imprinted on me now?

At no point did this person mention they were different. If I hadn't looked closely, I would have just assumed it was the same thing.

Always read everything you sign in full.Decklist: [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2196866](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2196866)

This is a very fun deck to play, but it's also surprisingly powerful. I've tuned this for Bo1, partly because that's currently the bulk of what I play, but also because I think this deck currently doesn't have the best sideboard options. It's not the strongest deck you can be playing right now, but I'm still doing a lot of tweaking and reworking of it to make it better. It's still slightly better than 50% win rate, but not by much. A nice thing about it though, is it's a blast to play, mostly because your opponents' strategies against it are invalidated. Your creatures keep coming back, recurring value, and it can also win via a built-in ""combo"" of sorts that can be set up with a single Doom Whisperer.

The ""combo"" in question is simple: surveil enough creatures into the yard, leave either a Lotleth Giant on top (if castable) or a Blood for Bones with a Giant in the yard. Swing out next turn, then finish off with the Lotleth Giant. However, keep in mind that if you are using Blood for Bones, you have to have a creature left to sacrifice to it (whoops [[Settle the Wreckage]], and that the Giant will do damage based on the number of creatures you take out AFTER you reanimate it as well as put one into your hand. You also want to make sure you account for anything your opponent might do, such as [[Scapeshift]] for lands that gain them life (with 3feri) or just straight burning you directly because you surveiled too low.

The path to victory is any one or more of five things. You can bum rush out a Rotting Regisaur or two on the back of a Llanowar Druid, which a lot of decks struggle to deal with because of its high toughness. You can go big in the air with Embodiment of Agonies (my record is 11/11) and Doom Whisperer. You can go wide with Izoni, though that is usually the weakest of the four strategies. You can keep recycling Mulderhulk with Memoria to Folly, which in turn brings back your Memorial, until your opponent runs out of answers. Or, you can Lotleth Giant for the win directly, either through a natural cast or through Blood for Bones.

You should mulligan aggressively with this deck. Going down to six or five cards is not a problem, because there's almost always one or more cards in your hand that you don't want until later anyways. You should always strive to go for a hand that does one of two things: Puts cards in your graveyards through your enablers, while having some sort of payoff for those enablers (Blood for Bones or Embodiment of Agonies). Or, ramps you into a turn two Rotting Regisaur. Beyond that, the deck usually takes care of itself in the long term, because of its recursive nature. A lot of times you WILL end up hard-casting your bombs, but don't bank on that -- try to close out games off EoA, RR, and Doom Whisperer where possible, or cheating out your bombs with Blood for Bones. You can almost always survive off two lands so long as you have right colors, and you have either a Glowspore Shaman, Temple of Malady, or Llanowar Elves, but be careful of hands where all your mana will come in to play tapped. Honestly, more of my losses have come from opening hands that didn't get moving fast enough, as opposed to the deck still losing once it gets moving.

A *lot* of the card choices in this deck are designed around making Embodiment of Agonies as big as possible, as well as getting Mulderhulk out faster. In essence, we want as much of a variety of casting costs as possible, as well as as many creatures as possible. I've tried to build this deck with less creatures, or having four copies of our best reanimation target (usually Pelakka Wurk, sometimes Lotleth Giant), and it really hamstrings the sheer power of Embodiment of Agonies. I've also tried to use a few less creatures, but nothing feels worse than having a Blood for Bones stranded in your hand because you don't have any creatures on the field, and it really slows down Molderhulk as well. Keep that in mind when making changes to this deck. This is probably the sixth or seventh version of this deck I've made, so it's fairly tuned at this point, but definitely explore further and have some fun with it.

The limitations of this deck come from the fact that our enablers just aren't as good as days gone past. Stitcher's Supplier is good, but without a cheap sac outlet like Modern has, it isn't as strong as it could be. Glowspore Shaman is alright, but you don't get the land right away, so it really does a poor impersonation of [[Satyr Wayfinder]]. There were much better enablers in days gone past, like [[Mulch]] or [[Grisly Salvage]], as well as better reanimation spells like [[Unburial Rites]]. (WotC is generally much more reserved about graveyard-based strategies today than they were in the past.) The only discard outlet we have is Rotting Regisaur, which is a strong creature but it would be better if we could pick and choose when we discard. (Fortunately, we don't need to discard that much.) There is no good cheap creature sac outlet in Standard right now -- we really need something at one or two CMC. Sometimes this deck will just die to itself, but that can be said about a lot of decks, and that's mitigated by the fact that we can mulligan so aggressively.

We also have really strained mana requirements in this deck. I want to be able to hit B or G on turn one, BG on turn two, 1BB on turn three, and 2BBB on turn five. (Math is obviously different with Llanowar Elves.) To get to this, I have to include Temple of Malady, but that also directly hurts us because it comes into play tapped. (The scry is really helpful though.) I wanted to be able to add blue into the deck, namely for [[Wall of Lost Thoughts]] and [[Agent of Treachery]], but the payoff didn't end up being worth it with the amount of damage I did to myself and the difficulty in hitting the right colors.

We are pretty heavily favored against most aggro strategies, because of our early game blockers and our later game lifegain and big creatures. Same favorable rate against midrange decks, because our creatures are bigger than their creatures. We have a *slightly* favorable rate against control (roughly 55/45) because of the recursive/value nature of the deck and because our big guns can't be killed by ""mini"" board wipes, but if control can get the right planeswalkers on the field they can definitely overcome it and they can counter our Blood for Bones if they don't tap out. However, tempo (namely Simic Flash) and combo (namely Scapeshift) are definitely big problems, and unfortunately they're all over the place right now.

-- CARD CHOICES --

[[Stitcher's Supplier]] (4) - The best enabler we have at the moment. It's also good for chump blocking, as well as getting in a few extra damage, because your opponents don't often want to kill it as it just furthers your gameplan. Also keep in mind that when you sac it to Blood for Bones, its trigger goes on the stack BEFORE you choose your targets for BFB, meaning more cards in the yard. However, keep in mind the trigger obviously invalidates the top of your library. You don't want to cast this, or have this die, after you set up the top of your library with a Glowspore Shaman or Temple of Malady.

[[Glowspore Shaman]] (4) - Really the only other enabler that's worth it under three CMC. Getting a land is very valuable in the early game as well, and because of its three power, it can trade with a fair amount of creatures that we care about in the early game. However, one toughness means it dies to a lot of incidental things, like [[Goblin Chainwhirler]] and [[Cry of the Cranium]]. Ultimately, I'd rather this either be something like a 0/4 wall, or actually put the land in your hand. Still, at least it's a creature.

[[Llanowar Elves]] (4) - Because a turn-two 7/6 wins games. Also because this deck has a lot of higher casting cost creatures, and it can make some strong plays in turn-three Blood for Bones, or even turn four Doom Whisperer or Cavalier of Night. The G casting cost doesn't butt up against any other cards, it chump blocks when we need it to, it sacs to BFB and Cav of Night, and it feeds Molderhulk and Lotleth Giant. Either run four or don't run it at all, but I find the best consistency when I run four. I wish this was an [[Elves of Deep Shadow]], but what can ya do.

[[Embodiment of Agonies]] (4) - One of the main reasons this deck works. On rare occasions I've had to cast this as a 2/2 just to get a deathtouch creature out, but typically it's at least 4/4 and very often much, much bigger. The fact that it is a flyer means that you can get over top of a lot of other decks, so he wins you games all by himself. It's also a great card to get back into your hand with BFB due to its cheap casting cost. Speaking of BFB, keep in mind that this card figures out its power and toughness while it enters the battlefield, which is often in the middle of a BFB cast, NOT at the end of it. Therefore, you can reanimate this guy, and he will enter with P/T based on what's in the yard BEFORE you put a creature into your hand.

[[Rotting Regisaur]] (4) - The only real discard outlet we have, as well as just being a huge early creature. This deck turns its negative into a plus, feeding our Embodiment of Agonies, Lotleth Giants, or just binning a reanimation target. He's also just dirt cheap to cast, so in longer games you can often Blood For Bones and reanimate something, put him in your hand, and cast him on the same turn, for a giant swing next turn or just to have solid defense while you destroy them in the air.

[[Blood for Bones]] (4) - The best reanimation spell in Standard, but you always have to remember that you need a creature out to actually make it work. Do NOT cast this if you think it will be countered, unless you don't care about the sacrificed creature. That said, the fact that it puts a creature out AND one in your hand is huge for us, because so much of our deck has ETB effects. Don't be afraid to sacrifice a big creature to this -- some of my best plays have been to sacrifice a creature like Molderhulk or Embodiment of Agonies to it after combat, bring back a Pelakka Wurm, and immediately re-cast the sacrificed creature.

[[Ravenous Chupacabra]] (1-2) - Not the greatest creature of this deck, but it will save your bacon sometimes. I really just needed something that could spot-kill a creature from time to time, while still being a creature itself. While Cav of Night often does a better job of this, sometimes we just don't have a creature to sacrifice to it. I originally had three, which ended up just being too many. I would always include at least one though, and its unique casting cost in this deck feeds the Embodiment.

[[Cavalier of Night]] (2) - One of the best creatures in this deck, because of its triggers, but also just because it has lifelink. Its leaves-the-battlefield trigger is actually better than its enters-the-battlefield, because it will almost always be bringing back a big Embodiment. Because of that, it's often one of the best things to sacrifice to Blood for Bones. The lifelink is icing on the cake, and is a big part of the reason we are favored against burn and a lot of other aggro strategies. I originally tried to run four of these, but I want to keep the casting costs in this deck as varied as possible for Embodiment, so I found that two was the sweet spot.

[[Doom Whisperer]] (2) - We need something in this deck that can blast through defenses, so the flying and trample is where it's at. The surveil is great in this deck, and can set up a finisher with Lotleth Giant. Plus the casting cost is easily achievable in this deck. My win rate improved when I added it in, and again when I went up to two copies, but we don't generally want any more than two of our big CMC guys.

[[Izoni, Thousand-Eyed]] (0-1) - It seems like this card would be better here, and he HAS won me games. But generally, it just doesn't cut the mustard. I like having one copy in as a reanimation target when I need it, and because of its unique casting cost. Also, he can fade an opponents lifelink by saccing the creature they will lifelink against when dealing damage. That all said, he's pretty much a flex spot.

[[Lotleth Giant]] (1-2) - You have to run one, because it can win games out of nowhere. He gives you that much-needed and very large killing blow against control and Scapeshift. His absurd casting cost and lack of trample REALLY hold him back though. He's also relatively pointless until you have a full graveyard. I run two for consistency, but you can get away with one if you really want to play around with the deck. I *hate* seeing him in my opening hand unless it's a card I'm going to bottom off a mulligan, but I also hate not seeing him when I need him to finish the game. At least run one.

[[Pelakka Wurm]] (1-2) - Very often our best reanimation target. Some games you really need the life, some games you really just need a really big trampler. Opponents tend to hate to remove him because you gain a card, but truthfully, that often doesn't matter that much. At least run one.

[[Molderhulk]] (2-3) - I really wish this had trample, but the fact that you can create a loop with him and Memorial to Folly is not something to be underestimates. He's also a great card to put into your hand with Blood for Bones because you can just re-cast him right away by that time. This deck fills up the yard fast enough that I've cast him as early as turn three, but turn four or five is usually more reasonable. It's also nice that you can use him as an extra land drop on a turn, so you can cast him, get a land, and cast something else, instead of waiting a turn. With that in mind, always think about what land you want to bring back before you cast him. Much of the time it's Memorial to Folly, but often it's a Temple for the scry, or an untapped land so you can cast something else that turn. Two is typically the best option for this card because they get in the way of each other with too many, but I really wouldn't go any lower than that.

[[Memorial to Folly]] (1-2) - The main reason for being in this deck is for recycling Molderhulk. However, in long running games you might just want to bring back something else to finish things off. Two things to watch out for though. One, if you have a Rotting Regisaur on the field, and an empty hand, then casting this on your opponent's end step just means you discard the card you grabbed during your upkeep. Two, don't forget that you're down one mana source when you burn this, so don't accidentally not be able to cast whatever you grabbed. Because it doesn't come into play untapped, and because it doesn't count as a Swamp for Woodland Cemetery, I ended up dropping this down to one copy, but it might be better to drop a Temple for an additional copy.

[[Temple of Malady]] (3-4) - Mainly a concession to hit our casting requirements when we need it. The scry is nice, but it's still not as nice as it coming into play untapped. Still, it is usually better to bring back with Molderhulk than just a Forest or something similar.

Other Lands (17-18) - [[Overgrown Tomb]] and [[Woodland Cemetery]] are obvious. The rest is just balanced so we can hit our colors when we need them, and to keep it so we're likely to draw two or more lands in our opening hand in Best of 1 due to the way Arena handles opening hands for that. Glowspore Shaman smooths out our inconsistencies a bit for us, thankfully.

-- Sideboard --

The sideboard in its current state is very loose. I mostly play this in Bo1, because the deck preys on the unpreparedness of your opponent in the first match. I also just don't think this deck has a lot of good sideboard options. [[Veil of Summer]] is good for making sure your spells don't get countered, but it shares a casting cost with Llanowar Elves and it's not a creature so it hurts the rest of your deck. [[Ashiok, Dream Render]] can prevent Scapeshift from doing its thing IF you draw it naturally and IF you can keep it on the field, but it is also not a creature and thus hurts the rest of the deck, as well as can't be reanimated. [[Plaguecrafter]] is a good option for when your opponent runs a lot of planeswalkers, but it shares a casting cost with Rotting Regisaur. On the plus side, you can often sac a Stitcher's Supplier to it, so that's not so bad. The extra Cav of Nights and Chupacabras can come in if you know you have creatures you need to deal with, and/or you really need the lifegain, but in general it's not much of a problem. I'm very open to suggestions on this one.

-- Matchups --

Mono-White - Trade creatures early. They're generally surprised that you're willing to trade your Llanowar Elves or Glowspore Shaman for a 1/1, but it advanced our game state better than it advances theirs. We generally want something big on the field so they are afraid to attack, and then a Cav of Night for the lifegain. Finish them off in the air.

Mono-Red - Same as mono-white, but lifegain is even more prioritized.

Vampires - Put out bigger creatures then them. Fade their lifegain when you can with Izoni, and just generally win in the air.

Elementals - Keep up the pressure early. Finish them off in the air before they can do crazy elemental things.

RB/Mardu Aristocrats - Trade creatures early. The less creatures they have on the battlefield, the better, once you start putting out the big guns. Lifegain is important. Target removal towards things like Judith or their sac outlet.

Mono-Blue - Get big flyers out as early as you can, and almost always swing in. Don't worry too much about targeted removal, as they are just going to make their stuff hexproof anyways. You generally win off the back of Embodiment and/or Doom Whisperer. Regisaur beats are nice but they often have something to put in its way.

Drakes/Phoenix - Mostly the same as mono-blue. Don't be afraid to trade your Embodiments for their drakes, because they are generally afraid to do the same. If they have Phoenix, you may need to choose when to strike and when to hold back blockers. Regisaur beats put your opponent on the defensive.

Feather - Pick and choose what to kill with targeted removal. Feather is the big gun to take out, but if they can protect it then you have a problem. You can often kill them before that point though. Beat down with Rotting Regisaur as fast as possible.

Control - Take out planeswalkers as quick as possible. Don't overcommit the board unless you know they cant [[Kaya's Wrath]], but generally try to keep some kind of pressure up. Cavalier of Night shines here, because even after a wrath, you end up with a huge Embodiment. Molderhulk recycling is also great. Lotleth Giant very often finishes off the game.

Simic Flash - They can generally counter everything you do that is worthwhile. Rush a Regisaur if you can, and try to get in as much damage as you can early in. Finish them off in the air if you can actually get a flyer to resolve. This is unfortunately just a very hard matchup.

Scapeshift - Try to clear their early [[Arboreal Grazer]] with your Glowspore Shaman if they'll go for it. Try to keep enough creatures out to kill 3feri if they resolve one, and prioritize killing it if they stick one. Hit them in the air as much as possible as early as possible. Finish them off with Lotleth Giant if you have the option to. Unfortunately, once they start rolling, it's usually game over.

-- Failed Cards --

[[Cavalier of Thorns ]] - The reach was nice against some decks, but usually it just didn't make enough of a difference on the battlefield. It was also occasionally difficult to cast on curve, but that was rare. Generally though, it just generally wasn't that great of a reanimation target unless I had yet another Blood for Bones in my hand and maybe it milled something worthwhile.

[[Plaguecrafter]] - Relegated to the sideboard because it shared a cost with Rotting Regisaur, thus shrinking the Embodiment. The only time I really found I was that happy to see him was if my opponent just stuck a 3feri with no creatures on board, and any other time I was disappointed with him.

[[Gorging Vulture]] - Mill four was nice, but not for three CMC. At that point we have other stuff we want to do in the deck. Also shared a cost with Regisaur, and we want to avoid shared costs. If it had bigger stats or deathtouch or something, I might like it, but it usually just got in the way more than it helped. I started with three, then two, then one, and settled on none.

[[Drakuseth, Maw of Flames]] - It had to actually be able to attack to be useful, and a lot of the time, it didn't. I ended up reanimating other targets a lot more often, so I ended up cutting it. The decks where he would help, I was already set to win, and the decks where I had problems he usually died before attacking. Better if you try to use Bond of Revival, but still didn't end up being that great.

[[Bond of Revival]] - The way this deck functions, I typically prefer sacrificing a creature and getting two back. Haste is nice, but generally this card means the deck goes in a bit of a different direction. There's a bit more experimenting to do with it, but the five CMC hurt it a bit as well. Still, not a bad card, and maybe the most difficult one to actually give up on.

[[The Eldest Reborn]] - Ended up being too slow. When I want to bring back a creature, I want to bring it back NOW. It was also painful if my opponent could remove it. Just ended up not working.

[[Wall of Lost Thoughts]] - If this could have somehow got me a land I would have loved it. By itself though, it was too hard to splash for blue for this.

[[Narcomoeba]] - A 1/1 flyer for free rarely mattered.

[[Discovery // Dispersal]] - It really needed to either dig one more, be one CMC cheaper, or be attached to a creature.

[[Connive // Concoct]] - I couldn't justify the splash for blue for a five CMC reanimation spell, because while surveil 3 is nice, you're going into it blind.

-- Conclusions --

Please let me know any ways you think this deck can be improved. I'm welcome to all forms of constructive criticism and ideas.Just went 20-2 with this stack of cards on Arena. I probably shouldn't be posting this and just keep riding the wins instead of hitting the mirror match, but ah well.

MTG Goldfish link: [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1556216](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1556216)

The idea here is to hit your land drops, get lots of value, and run them over with hexproof creatures or creatures that provide value even if you know they're going to die. Pretty simple plan, since this format tends to reward you for generating value. Let's discuss card choices.

* Lots of lands that enter tapped? No big deal, we aren't doing anything until turn 3 anyways. You generally only want to run out creatures if they are going to generate you value. We don't care too much if our Jadelight Ranger or Elvish Rejuvenator die because we played the first creature, and they can snipe early creatures by our opponents. We also want to make sure we hit our colored mana.

* 25 lands? (4x all duals, 7x basics, 1x D. Tower, 1x FoR) -- This format rewards you for being durdly, though every once in a while you have to just swarm the opponent -- such as when you have a board state of hexproof creatures and Conclave Cavaliers and your opponent can't really keep up anymore.

* 4x [[Knight of Autumn]] and 3x [[Reclamation Sage]] -- Hold these back a little bit unless you have multiple in your hand. You want to save these for when your opponents get ""cute"" and run artifacts and enchantments in this format. Knight of Autumn is an all-star here because of versatility. Make sure you stack the triggers correctly if you need to make the Knight kill an x/4 or x/3. Also, KoA is a knight, so synergy with Benalia.

* 3x [[History of Benalia]] -- Works great with our kinghts, and just provides value. Either your opponent has to kill the creature then usually have their creature auto-killed next turn, or you start to overrun them. Maybe a 4-of, but I only have 3.

* 4x [[Elvish Rejuvenator]] and 4x [[Jadelight Ranger]] -- Provides value, can ramp you, smooths out your draws during any stage of the game. Fine to run out into an open board. Again on Jadelight, make sure you stack the triggers correctly.

* 4x [[Nullhide Ferox]] -- A powerhouse. I'd run more if I could. Can't be sniped by the format unless your opponent sinks mana AND has 6 damage for it.

* 3x [[Vine Mare]] -- A poor man's Nullhide that shines in this format. Hexproof wins games.

* 4x [[Conclave Cavlier]] -- So much value, and synergizes with Benalia. Also the vigilance is nothing to joke about, as keeping back blockers is great here. Makes your opponent regret playing their creatures, because the generated tokens just kill the creatures right back.

* 3x [[Rhox Oracle]] -- Normally a dud, but here it kills a lot of creatures and replaces itself. Clears up board stalls and wins games.

* 2x [[Carnage Tyrant]] -- Obvious card is obvious. Should possibly be a 3-of, but I only own two. Great closer.

* 1x [[Detection Tower]] -- Since hexproof is obvious in this format, we need at least one, but max two.

* 1x [[Field of Ruin]] -- Shuts down anything cute the opponent is trying to do, like recur Mulderhulks. I can't imagine running more than one though, considering our mana requirements and the low amount of real problem lands.A pretty simple question, that I just never see asked here. Or, if it has been asked, it hasn't got a lot of discussion, or at least not recently. I'm not talking about a price to taste ratio. Just, basically, what is your absolute favorite bourbon, and why?

Feel free to elaborate as much or as little as you want. ""If I'm in an X mood, I choose bourbon Y, but if I'm in a different mood..."" and such. Or keep it simple. ""I like X bourbon, because it's good."" Or, make a game out of the question. ""If I could only drink one bourbon for the rest of my life, it would be bourbon X."" Whatever route you choose, it just comes back to the same question: What's your favorite?

My only stipulation is that, if you choose any kind of Pappy, you also give a non-Pappy answer. Just so we don't get into a big Pappy debate.

So again: What is your favorite bourbon, and why?I'm struggling to research the proper password management and documentation tool for our company, so I'd like some feedback from those in the trenches already. I've done some research and I've went through this subreddit, but I'm trying to find specific information that relates to our own situation and wants, without it just being a sales pitch.

We've looked at offerings from IT Glue, SIPortal, and PassPortal, just to name a few. But it can be hard to really get a feel for these until you've made the full commitment and really integrated it into your work flow. Any help would be appreciated, so, thank you in advance if you chime in.

Some must-have features for us include:

* **Compliance/Auditing** -- More and more of our clients are in the HIPPA or PCI compliance space, and we just want to keep up with those industries as a whole anyways. We definitely need a way to audit specific passwords, as well as specific technicians, so when someone leaves the company we have a way to assess what passwords that person accessed, and change them accordingly. We would also need two-factor authentication for access to whatever solution we go with, ideally in the form of a rotating authenticator syle app on our phones like Duo or Google Authenticator.

* **Integration** -- We currently use Connectwise and Solarwinds for much of our day to day work. The ability to do things like, say, pull in server data from our RMM, would help with things like onboarding, as well as finding out if we are missing any gaps or just accidentally recording data wrong. I imagine it would also help in billing, but Ihave less knowledge of this side of things.

* **Reliability** -- We're dead in the water if this goes down, much like many MSP's. We're fine with hosting our solution or relying on someone else's servers, so long as either option just works, day in and day out. A couple of the solutions we tested would, for example, have you enter in all the information on an asset, then crash or throw you back to the login page after you submit it. This can be frustrating, but I fear that it will become much more of a problem if you thought you saved some information, but you somehow didn't.

* **Visibility** -- Our current solution will show you important things about a client that are outside the norm, right when you first visit their page, so you can avoid stepping on a landmine. Maybe a client has a particular piece of software that has to be manually ran and logged inito after doing a server reboot. This is a bad example, but you get my drift. When a non-primary technician does work for a client, we want to make sure that a critical piece of information is brought to their attention before things go sideways.

Some lesser-important, but still nice to have, features for us include:

* **Ease of Use** -- We currently have a fairly information-filled ""at a glance"" page for each client. This helps streamline day-to-day work and larger projects, because you can quickly and efficiently get a lot of information at your fingertips. If I have to work on a lot of hardware and software at once, it's nice to be able to have that page open as my ""control panel"". Some of the things we've looked into require 3-4 page loads per piece of hardware/software. It's not the end of the world to go through this, but we like to stay efficient, especially when time is of the essence. It's also not critically important, but the ability to put clickable hyperlinks somewhere is generally less cumbersome than cut-and-pasting a firewall's address into your web browser. It would be nice to have a page that you can see all/most of your hyperlinks, usernames, and passwords (HIDDEN!) right at your fingertips.

* **Document Uploading** -- This might be critically important, but pretty much every solution has some kind of ability to do this, so it's in this category. We currently have our own wiki of sorts for information sharing within the company, but it doesn't allow for document uploading. However, our current password management does. This is nice when you need to add in specific documents for that client, or just want to create a New Workstation Deployment Guide for clients, for example.

* **Speed** -- If our new solution is dragging ass, then we are spending time waiting on it, and that can be frustrating. This is less important when everything is running smoothly, but when something breaks, time is money for many clients. If our solution is waiting for 15-30 seconds on each page load, that can add up. More importantly though, it's just frustrating for the technician when you're having a bad day. Good tools that ""just work"" at a good pace allow you to keep your mind on the problem at hand, in my experience, whereas slow tools cause frustration which also cause breaks in concentration.

* **Password Cycling** -- Some of the solutions we found allow for integration into things like the Active Directory of our clients, so we can rotate credentials both manually and automatically. The idea being, anything else we can then sync to the client's AD, would also get rotated along with it. This would help whenever a technician leaves the company, as well as for just checking a box in our pitch to new clients about increased security.

* **Sub-Sites** -- I feel like any solution should already have this incorporated, but, its generally preferred for us to categorizes some of our sites as sub-sites to clients, instead of creating a separate page for each.

* **Linking Assets** -- Some of the solutions we explored allow you to enter one asset, then link it in different fields for another asset. For example, a client with two Active Directory domains, and two virtual servers, each handling a different domain. You would be able to enter in each domain, then when creating the server assets, you would be able to use those domains to fill out which server handles what. Then if the domain ever changes (lord help us), updating the domain information automatically updates the information for anything else linked to that domain. This isn't a must-have feature, but I feel like it can help cover a few missed gaps during major projects and client updates.

* **Automatic Connection** -- If our solution integrates with SolarWinds, it would be nice to be able to click a button and, say, automatically be sent over to SolarWinds's Take Control agent for that server/workstation. This would be even nicer if we could somehow incorporate a single sign-in for both, so with a click or two I'm on a server's desktop, awaiting me to put in credentials for that server.

* **Cost** -- We're willing to pay the price for the right tool that fits us. However, it it hard to get that information without going through the whole sales process for every tool we want to investigate. What kind of costs, both up front and hidden, have you discovered with your solution?

* **You Tell Me** -- Things that I don't even know that we want/need, but suddenly become clear upon use. Maybe your experience has shown you that a particular feature is a lifesaver, and I don't even know about that feature.

This... has turned into a long post. I'm just trying to go over as much information as I can, and get as much information in return as anyone is willing to give me. Again, thanks in advance for any help.I was trying to get several deck archtypes to work and failing. After getting frustrated, I just jammed everything good into one deck, most for shits and giggles. And it's been my strongest ""brew"" so far.

Decklist: [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2297595](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2297595)

The rough idea is this:

- 8 Dorks (Druid, Goose)
- 4 Once Upon a Time
- 4 Hydroid Krasis
- 4 Murderous Rider
- 3-4 Questing Beast
- ...
- 3-4 Oko
- 3-4 Nissa
- 1 Liliana
- ...
- 4 Assassin's Trophy
- ...
- 4 Fabled Passage
- 12 Shocks
- 3 Basics
- 4 Temples

Fill the rest to taste. Between Rider, Trophy, and Oko, you can kill/disable/steal anything in the game. Questing Beast ruins opposing planeswalkers as well as is just a ridiculous creature. Krasis keeps your hand full and your life topped off, as well as being a flying trample beater. Nissa wins games as anyone knows. Oko is really hard to get rid of and controls the game, or just becomes a 3/3 factory especially with Goose. Once Upon a Time either smooths out your opening hand or finds you a good creature.

There's really no crazy synergy here, it just seems to run over everyone so far. Anyone else been trying something similar?The death toll is going to continue to rise, and the makeshift quarantine isn't going away any time soon. What will happen in regards to things like burials and funerals? Or do we have the capacity to delay these?"

pyrovoice,6,9,"Jinx painting the board, Darius pulling YOU in for the kill, Anivia blooming from her egg... They were short and smartly integrated in the game itself. I feel like cinematic level ups take you out of the game and make you wait a bit too long, especially when you've already seen them many times.

The first time seeing those new animations is awesome though, not sure what could be a solution.Particularly presenting cards as themed groups, with small spoilers for the next group. This makes navigating the sub easier than having a post per card, allow us to see and discuss mechanics with all information.Let's say you have your typical RPG, and your team meets a cute little guy that think they're though but are absolutly harmless. Now your team needs to make the little guy believe that they bested them in a fair fight, while holding their punch enough that they do not accidently defeat the guy. Has there be a fight like this where the goal is to find an alternative way to win without damaging the main opponent?Spoiler about the last season!

So I finally got to finish Legion, and while this show will always be one of my favorite, I have a big issue with the ending and the change in Farouk's heart. When exactly does he become a good guy?

Through the story, Farouk is shown as a sadistic torturer to David and generally doing whatever he wants, regardless of the hurt he causes up to the end of season 2. Then, at the end of season 2, he apparently infect everyone's mind and make David's previous allies turn on him.

During season 3, we mostly have David vs Team Farouk with various adventures in time, and then the final showdown where Farouk shows the humanity's beauty and completely change his old self's point of view. Problem is, before season 3 nothing at ALL was hinting for this development, and nothing really happened in season 3 that would provoke such a big change.

Moreover, the only scene that would indicate Farouk's love for David would be the one where he first infect him as a child, and we see him with the baby in his arm, showing real love and affection. But this does not undo all the shit he did through the serie, literally trying to break his mind in season 1.

So my question is: When and why did Farouk went from a sociopath villain to a good guy?It's a real pain to kill that elite, much more than others, since your shooting window is so short. Adding a way to stagger him or breaking his shield like some other enemies would be a welcomed change.Rules are simple:

- Pick a [Theme Deck](https://eternalwarcry.com/decks?dn=theme%20deck&dt=1&td=2)

King_Ahura,10,10,"***Lemming Trains***

I decided to pick up talking about this because i guess i was getting tired of it being a low effort complaint towards public matches. I don’t think it's the best (or a good) strategy by any means but this has more to do with people not playing their tanks abilities in context to the map and enemy lineup vs the actual numbers.  Too many people fight the train, don’t exploit the numbers advantage, and play their tank wrong as a method to get back at the “idiots” and fuck their own games. but also the lemming trains fail as a strategy because of a lack of knowledge and let's call it bravery. 

A few concepts to devour and than i guess my point. 

***Positioning***

 **Key areas of the map** : 

Something simple is understanding where you want to fight, you can’t pick to fight just poop tanks but you can always choose to work the strong parts of a lane or map to your advantage (or the strengths of your tank/team lineup and deployment). 

Pick your engagement, (where you want to fight). There's general and specific positioning, general is saying im going banana road, booby hills, hill, magical forest, not ice road, not beach, a general area of the map aka a lane. Specific is a certain bush, corner, rock, a position where you can best play the strengths of your tank in a lane. With a lemming train you’re sort of stuck with what the team ran with as far as general but lots of times you can work specific positions to support or keep the train moving even if its you making it up with whats in front of you and just using your best micro moves trying to combo like ryu. 

 **Angles** :

So by angle think about it this way. It's this magical low effort strategy people tout here for absolutely anything: “just flank bro” . We all know this advice is shit lets not pretend but consider what we’re actually getting at. It's that for the most part tanks armor is in the front, everyone can only shoot one thing at a time, and we know people have **some** slight tendency to go to the same places on a map. Many times the map makes you just brawl and micro a position out but at the very least you’ll always have opportunities to create an angle on an enemy tank in the late game. If you’re stalled out in a position and not using your gun don’t sit there. Find something to do. Help your wn8 and the team out by finding a way to shoot something. 

The second part to angles is the flip side, what happens when you’ve got lots of targets and wide space? Too many angles, how can you get your armor to work. You want to limit your exposure to fire and damage. So you pick the angle and method (sidescrape/hulldown), you peek the shithead that lets you stay in cover or portected the most and limits the guns that can shoot you to nullify their advantage of numbers and you try to whittle them down.  

**Isolating nerds** : 
	
How to continue to pick locations? the ideal location is one in which lets you fight 1 tank at a time and limits you’re angles to give the best chances of not taking damage. This allows you to work your tank to it's potential and ideally in a lemming situation you can overwhelm **WITH OTHERS** a lonely bunghole. In a platoon or with meds you might call this **”wolfpacking”**. Don’t be the one isolated and take guns out of the game. 
	
You see it all the time, early game a lonely scrublord (possibly yourself but lets not judge the dumb decisions we all have made fam) makes a push into an area to spot, control,etc; but they have no help, not within render to have their team shoot what they’re spotting, etc. They than get murked and genital destruction by the other team who had numbers. They get mad, they ping the map, they cry, we’re mad they wasted a tank, arty is head deep in their own farts, it's a bad time. 
	
This scenario leads to when you’re in your meta position and you and 5 tanks stare down 1 or 2 tanks having not spotted more behind them. You take 5 mins while your other lane gets shit on. What happened?? You sat there with an advantage of numbers and 2 isolated nerds. Fuck them up next time. Passive play in the wrong instances gets you the big L. 

**Funneling**

This works both for and against you and both sides of the lemming train. A riff on the shit above its just a way to conceptualize something. Funneling is pretty obvious if a group of tanks is funneled down to the only person actually engaging is 1 tank someone has failed, the position is obviously not working for the side with a numbers advantage but doing wonders for the other one. In a lemming train it's situation big oof  because the main advantage you have is sheer numbers and the hp/dpm that goes with those numbers at cost of weakening a flank. So when you’re in the funnel back the fuck out, find another angle if possible. 

**Stalling**	

This weakening of a flank leads into what happens there? Normally 1 or 2 rage filled people who usually have mics and quickly chastise the team post their deaths. Beyond that the other team is moving, if it's not or losing while having superior numbers they’re bad and they should feel bad. After the stubborn people who have died they now have free roam of the map or flank typically towards your base. This is why when on the lemming side it's so important to **push** and push quickly, speed is a lemmings best friend on the attacking side and **delaying** is what's important on the weak flank. IF a lemming train stalls out this is where they lose (on a standard battle) as they're now wearing chaps and running backwards through a cornfield. 

***ACTION***

[**Being brave**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGYV690EVKs&list=PLnrmNZLB7GPCDMDn7qkWQO-XWKX4gXbo9&index=2)
	
As Zeven talks about here ^^^ sometimes you have to be brave, put on the leader pants, encourage and coax the rest of the shy pubbies into moving their playing for ~~dat L~~ fun selves. You have to find a way to get them to help you and not be afraid to take a few hits. Many times you’ll have to find a way to keep the team moving because again there should be a mental timer going off saying we have to move forward or i've got to get shooting. This can invlove you taking a hit for the team to get a superior position or start the YOLO over the top of a ridge to overwhelm someone. Pubbies get brave if they’re especially stupid or they think there is no way they can lose. Don’t throw your tank away for the sake of trying to get people to move all that gets is a disappointed you but if the team is hung up on a 1 shot tank it's worth the hit. By all means tho dont let a mouthbreathers bad decision and distraction prevent you from shooting. Normally they'll spot something or even turn a person around before they die for easy shots. Dont waste your ~~spaced armor~~ teammates contributions.


**WAAAAY TL;DR**

Basically the point in this comes to lemming trains are genuinely not always worth bitching about, yeah they’re not the smartest strategy but put some deodorant on, drink some water, and chill. It's a numbers advantage run out of control (like a train :D ) it has the advantage of world of tanks is not a 1vs Basically any number over 1 being possible game in most situations. They fail when the numbers fail to exploit themselves and succeed when they get courageous and push and keep pushing while keeping mindful of the time comes to defend their own base if need be. I figured id add some blueberry knowledge on top to sound smarter than i am. But please lets not keeping posting in every bitch moan thread how ""my team lemming trained"" and thats why you sucked not cause you sucked. It happens we all make tomato sauce on occasion, just leave it to the Italians yeah?

SuperFLEB,10,7,"I'm going to be starting a game (homebrew apocolyptic horror) that involves mental effects on players-- things like delusion, hallucination, creeping rage, and depression. I'm working with a table showing general effects at different damage stages-- things like ""frequently hear small snippets of voice"" or ""you know everyone is conspiring against you"".

I haven't really GMed much of this, though, so I'm not sure what mix works best between briefing a player and letting them run with it (""You're at Madness 20, here is what your character is experiencing""), and forgoing the symptom list and using direct narration (""You hear someone behind you ... no one's there"").

My gut feeling is that it's going to be better to just brief and let players roleplay more for ""mood"" issues like anger or depression, but rely more on narration in the case of ""distorted perception"" issues like delusions or hallucinations.

Any advice or experiences to share?As far as I can tell, there's nothing about not participating in discussions linked from elsewhere in either the Reddit Rules or Reddiquette pages. However, I've seen links to these pages in the RES blurb and by others, supposedly to justify the legitimacy of the ""NP"" idea as coming from part of Reddit's rules. As far as I can tell, it's at best a weak interpretation of a couple of points on the Reddiquette page. What am I missing?Title mistake: I meant to mention that I'm looking for something to plug USB drives into.

---

For a while, I've been using my Asus 802.11n router with a USB port in it to hook up USB hard drives and stream the contents to my Roku. It's worked, in some sense of the word, but it has its problems and is just flaky. More often than not, removing the hard drive temporarily then reconnecting it involves having to fiddle with the DLNA server, perhaps uninstall it, perhaps reinstall it, perhaps pull the drive and wipe the download directory on it because the install got botched, and of late, it's just been failing to start the DLNA server at all. So I'm pretty fed up with that.

I've checked out a couple more recent consumer-grade offerings (Linksys and Netgear 802.11ac routers-- thanks Costco return policy!) and have found them better, but still opaque and finicky unto unworkable. They tend to be running some minimal open-source DLNA server, with only enough options wired up to be adequate should everything work exactly as expected. Which it never does. At this point, I'm convinced that the USB-storage options on any router I can afford are going to be a spit-and-baling-wire job that's only there to mark a bullet point.

So, I'm searching for options. I don't want a NAS with drive bays, because I want to use the USB drives I have, both because I already have them, and for the convenience of detaching them and taking my media drive elsewhere without needing to lug around a NAS. Plus they tend to cost too much. I'm looking at a price somewhere not far from USD$100-150.

There doesn't seem to be much in the way of simple USB-to-network bridges out there. I've found a couple dodgy-looking off-brand units that just make me fear the same problems again, and everything else is just SATA NASs or routers with terrible implementations.

So, my latest idea is to snag a used netbook (my local used-parts store is offering them on a Black Friday sale for $70) and run a simple non-transcoding DLNA server and an SMB daemon, and whatever else I might need on it. As I see it:

Downsides:

* USB 2.0. That said, if I have a big brick of data to move, I can always pull the drive.
* Probably won't have the muscle to transcode realtime. Then again, I don't transcode now, so no big deal.
* A *bit* more power consumption than a standalone device. However, that's less than leaving my beast of a desktop on 24/7 for TV streaming.

Upsides:

* It's a general-purpose computer, so I've got a lot of leeway on what I can use it for.
* If anything goes south, I can remote into it and have as much control as I need.
* Assuming I can bust the door and get the $70 deal, it should be a lot cheaper than a NAS device. Even if I can't, it should be roughly the same.

So, anyone doing this? Or has anyone solved this issue in a way I haven't considered yet?"

Then last night while killing threshers in Caustic Caverns she busts out [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZuzzapfPHQ&feature=youtu.be&t=473)

Holy shit.  She genuinely scared me.  I can't believe with so many hours into the game there's still dialog I've never heard.During the 'Road to Sanctuary' he says:

*Roland:* That's the power core. Great-- Jack won't destroy Sanctuary today, at least. Get back to the city. We'll meet up once I get there. Welcome to the Crimson Raid-- ah, dammit. I'm being attacked, I'll see --

But after ""A Dam Fine Rescue""

*Lilith:* How the hell did those bandits snag you, anyway?

*Roland:* Uh... I was taking a leak and one of 'em knocked me out.

*Lilith:* Wow. You are a dumbass.

So the arc of moral justice may be short and brutal.

After a weekend seething over the dismissal of Ellen Pao, we get a couple of bombshells dropped on Reddit today.  The most interesting was this comment by yishan.  According to him, the one person most dedicated to keeping Reddit a 'free speech zone' was Ellen Pao.  And, because she had the social clout as a visible feminist in Silicon Valley, she was pretty much unimpeachable in her decision to leave racist or sexist subreddits intact.  After all, if Ellen Pao says it's OK, who are we to disagree?

Well, until rabid Reddit impeached her that is.

Now with her gone, Reddit has no leverage against critics to keep the most objectionable subreddits going.  In what could be a singularity-creating mass of schadenfreude, the mob that forced Pao out may have doomed themselves by removing their only champion.  I tell you, there isn't enough popcorn in the world.

Thursday should be an interesting day for Reddit. . . I posted this as a comment in the main thread on the satellite pictures, but it will likely get buried.  And a lot of people have been clamoring for an exact location of the image.  I have done your homework for you and given cross-references between Google Maps and the image from NATO.

Thanks to Google Maps I was able to find the exact location of the picture:

https://goo.gl/maps/3nphc

One thing to note is that the satellite image is 'upside down' insofar as North is pointing down. I rotated the image 180 degrees to fix the orientation. The convoy is heading down a road to the west and there are two small bodies of water in front of them. A smaller oval-ish lake is south-west of the western group. It is distinct that it has two little nubs sticking out. One to the east and one to the north. There is a large trapezoidal field across the road from the lake to the NE. The road continues around that field and hooks north between that field and another body of water.

On the link I posted to Google Maps, here are the cross-references:

The location is about 4 miles north of Krasnodon, Ukraine.
All through the summer and the pre-season, we watched the Bills trade away talent for 2018 picks.  A lot of us grudgingly accepted this as an unfortunate necessity.  And the pile of draft picks we were accumulating made the sacrifice seem worth it.  But more-or-less everyone, including myself, believed this season was a forlorn hope from the beginning.  In the wake of the Watkins and Darby trades, I had no hope for this campaign.  I have been a fan of Tyrod Taylor from the start and I felt he was completely boned at the start of the season.  When your best receiver is Jordan Matthews, it should be a long year.

And yet. . . 

Here we are in Week 15 and the Bills have a playoff spot.  Sure, it's iffy we will hold on to it.  But did anyone here honestly thing we'd be in this position?  Not me, that's for sure.  People were throwing around records like 4-12 or 5-11 on Week 1.  There was a serious 'Suck for Luck' mentality here.  So whether you hate or love *how* the Bills got here, I think everyone is surprised that this is where we are.  We can put asterisks by our eight wins that say 'unconvincing win,' but at the end of the day those are still Ws.

The season has been far more entertaining and exciting than I'd ever hoped.  Even if we still don't make the playoffs this year, at least I didn't wind up taking a year off from watching the Bills.Chalk me up as another that is putting this game down until Frontier fixes these game breaking bugs.  I have been a stalwart supporter of this game - accused of being a fan boi on many occasions.  But this is the third night in a row that my Asp has been interdicted and summarily instagibbed by a pirate.  I assume that this is the rail gun/PA bug, coupled with the infinite chaff.  Tonight it was an Adder that took out my A-rated Asp.  Silly me thinking I could take him on, but he nuked my Class 5 shields in a single pass, despite four pips.  Before I could retract my weapons and get out of dodge I was dead.

No, I do not need to 'git gud'.  Yes I know how to fly and adjust power and all that bullshit.  It's just buggy NPCs and they are way too common to play at the moment.  I have deep pockets and a small armada of ships, so the rebuys and the lost cargo aren't much skin off my back.  I feel really bad for anyone just starting out.

How the hell this got past QA is anyone's guess, but beta testing is supposed to account for things like this.  I didn't play in this beta, but I did not hear about stupidly OP NPCs, just smarter ones.  So this means either they beta did not cover everything they released or someone threw in a patch after beta was over.  Either way, for the first time, I am giving a big thumbs down to Frontier.  

New players and casuals are going to flee this game in droves unless this is fixed immediately."
Kai_Daigoji,6,6,"Then I wondered what they were afraid of.I've seen several posts in the last couple of days asking me to sign a White House petition to make it illegal to teach Creationism or Intelligent Design in science classes.

What people seem unaware of is that this is *already* illegal.  The Supreme Court has [ruled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epperson_v._Arkansas) that the teaching of creationism violates the establishment clause of the first amendment.

That's why creationists came up with Intelligent Design.  However, in [*Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District), the courts again ruled that this was illegal.  (You should check the case out, it's awesome.  The judge's opinion is the legal equivalent of dropping the mic and walking out.)

The courts have consistently held that teaching creationism or intelligent design in science class is illegal - signing a petition to make it illegal will accomplish nothing.  If this is honestly a problem in some districts, there are other venues to seek redress.  Find people willing to challenge school boards in court; petition the government to crack down harder on this, etc.  But shut up about the stupid petitions.[removed]I've been in an enormous rut with writing.  I've been 'working on my thesis' for my MFA for 5 years now, and am no closer to graduation than I was 5 years ago.  I couldn't handle it - every time I even went to open the word file, I had so much anxiety I wanted to vomit.

Over the years, this became a somewhat comfortable rut.  The anxiety was lesser, but I still would have the hardest time forcing myself to work.  I always found other things to do.

So, this year, as a New Years Resolution, I decided to become a writer again.  I got the book *Nudge* from my brother for Christmas, which is a book about behavioral economics (it's super interesting and readable, actually) which included a story about a procrastinating professor who, in order to finish his dissertation, wrote a $500 check to a colleague every month, on the grounds that they wouldn't cash it until the 1st of the month.  He could get the check back by turning in a chapter of his dissertation.

So I decided to try it.  I told a friend of mine that if I didn't give her 10,000 words by the end of the month, I owed her $50 to buy a board game, and play it without me (my friends and I are all major gamers.)

Well, today is the 31st, and I hit 10,000 words today.  I procrastinated for the first 20 days, I hated having a deadline, but I did the work.  And it feels amazing.

Anyway, I just wanted to share.I created /r/badhistory because I realized there really wasn't a subreddit to post some of the ridiculous, misinformed, and amazingly wrong historical facts you see sometimes on reddit. Modeled after /r/badlinguistics, my hope is that /r/badhistory can be a place to blow off steam and laugh at stubbornly wrongheaded historical ideas. So if you've ever been frustrated with a historical discussion on reddit, check out /r/badhistory (or at least post the comment so we can enjoy it.)"
Smoof47,5,7,"I'd like to start by saying Sjin is one of my favorite yogs and all this stuff is just heart breaking. I actually never knew about the original accusations way back when, so this is all very new to me. It's incredibly strange to see so many different sides on this. For example, I'll read one thread saying he messaged underage girls for nudes and another saying he simply flirted with an of age woman. How does anyone at this point have to knowledge to say he is innocent or guilty with all this conflicting info going around? From my point of view, having never heard of the original ""drama"", I think it would be best for everyone to just trust Lewis. If there is one person I trust, it is Lewis. Lewis has done nothing but save the yogs over and over again. So, I think we should all just wait for his word and chill out. All this speculation is just making people confused, including me. Now, I'm not saying to just drop all discussion, but people should really stop being either so defensive or accusatory of Sjin in those discussions. I get that everyone is dying waiting to hear the results of the investigation, but seriously, just chill. Witch hunting is not something you want to be a part of, it is a waste of time and energy. 

/rant

TL;DR Take the chill-pillCigarettes! Or more precisely tobacco. It seems like such a staple drug for people living on the edge why not add it? Maybe it could relieve stress from certain things faster and boost morale in a person for a bit but be highly addictive but cheap? I don't know, but what I do know is that if your gonna have a ton of drugs in the game, why skip out on this one?

Edit: Some words fixed and just one thing: To those saying cigarettes should only have negative debuffs; I feel as a gameplay mechanic cigarettes and other tobacco products should have SOME positive effects but should have negatives as well. It wouldn't really add much to the game if you could grow tobacco and all it would give to your conlinists is negative mood swings and health problems(even though that might be true in real life).

dunkster91,8,6,"Whenever I'm home from school I visit my sister's family and do bedtime stories with my nephew. He sometimes gets distracted and we just end up talking. 

Yesterday out of nowhere he claimed he was afraid of witches. Mind reeling (where did he pick up this fear?), my immediate thought was *how can I help him overcome this fear?*. 

Enter Dresdenverse. I calmly explained to him that there are protections against witches, monsters, and evil things that use magic. When people live in a home and all love each other, I told him, they create their own magic. So you, your baby brother, your mom and your dad all love each other very much. And you've lived here for two years. 

So I continued, explaining that their love for each other is its own kind of magic. As long as a witch doesn't get invited inside, they won't be able to use any magic against you. 

Took him a moment to think about that, but when it settled, he accepted it and was content. Happened earlier this week.

For three months I've been dating a girl who I'd been friends with for a few years prior.  As such, things are great.  We're both on our college swim team, so we have a lot of the same friends.  Comfortable with each other, not a lot of awkward ""getting to know each other"" things.  Its fantastic.

So its exam time and she needed a study break.  Since I'm in grad school, I've been working for home and decide we should go for a drive.  

While I'd been working that day, I started pacing my room and saw some lace.  I don't own anything lace-y.  So I reach under the foot of my bed and pull out a thong.  Oh dunkster91 you sly devil you, Leia* forgot her undies one of the times she slept over.

I brought them with me for the drive.  We're making small talk, I'm letting her de-stress.  It can be rather mind-numbing to spend all day on campus for days on end, so I just let her ramble a bit.  Eventually we come to a break in conversation and I ask if she's forgotten something at my house recently.

She starts guessing what it could be.  Quickly she realizes its something not-pg, but can't quite guess it.  ""Panties"" I finally answer.  She then tries to figure out when it happened, maybe after we got back from the team trip.  ""You definitely weren't wearing a thong on the plane"" I respond.  ""Maybe it was after our formal?  Its pretty nice and I don't remember seeing you in it, so it must've been one of the times I was drunk/tired/it was dark"".

Giving up, and without her knowing I've brought it with me, she says to just toss it.  The cheap Scotsman inside me thinks this is ridiculous (additionally I know I brought it with me).  ""Throw it out?!  That's silly!  Here you go!""

She takes them, inspects them.  Silently, she turns to me.  ""Dunkster91... these aren't mine.""

Dread.  Panic.  Escape.  Can I somehow get out of here without her knowing?  Probably not.  Mind racing, I determine who's they are (one of the few times not having an active sex life has helped me) - my ex, a friend of a teammate of ours, from back in **May**.  

Somehow throughout the entire summer, fall, and winter, including two trips requiring substantial packing, I've failed to notice the panties of my exgirlfriend lying beneath my bed.  And I gave them to my current girlfriend.

Needless to say, they were deposited into a garbage can at the nearest gas station.  Thankfully, Leia* took it well and laughed it off.  But I'm never going to get to forget this.

*obviously not her name

TIFU giving my girlfriend a thong that I thought was hers, but was my ex's and had been under my bed since May.Throughout the text (some of it may have been in *Your Story* too), there are Dresden-ish quips in the margins, written by Dresden, Billy, or Bob.

Most of the time, in hindsight, these comments have shown to be foreshadowing.  What made me notice this was a comment or two about Harry becoming the Winter Knight, or having to razz Peabody for his poor translation of Erl King.  In-universe, this book takes place between *Small Favor* and *Turn Coat*.

Hints are dropped like ""I wonder when I'll see Susan again"" or ""Slate is scum, but I couldn’t kill him in cold blood.""  Or that we haven't seen Ace in a while, and that Mab has a specific reason to hate Bob.

To review some of the other hints, currently unanswered, see below (I may have missed some, and some are just reminders of other points raised in the books):

Gard grabbed a Denarian (safely) in SF, meaning Monoc Securities likely has one coin.

""One dragon [Ferrovax]... is too many.""  And, on a related note, whether or not Ferrovax was infected with Nemesis at Bianca's party in GP (not that in-text Harry knows what Nemesis is at this point, but he recognizes that the athame is special).  Bob notes that lesser dragons can be found in the Nevernever.

""I’ve always suspected that my godmother Lea had some connection to the Wild Hunt, given her penchant for turning those that offended her into Hellhounds, but I’ve never been able to remember to ask her about it.""

Blacked out, but copy & paste-able if you have the .pdf file, is this little comment on gods (emphasis mine):  ""Varied, due to their individual portfolios and divine enemies. Also, and this is pure theory, **lack of mortal worship and belief in them may have made them go dormant**, or it could have been something that the author isn’t ready for us to know about yet. So sit on your hat!

""I figure the government must have something similar to Chicago PD’s SI unit, at least through the FBI. There’s probably a real world X-Files unit somewhere, but I haven’t heard anything about it. Maybe the Senior Council knows...""

""A couple years ago, I would have worried more about this little magic savvy army Marcone’s been building. I’ll probably start worrying at full worry levels again when the vamps are under control.""

""Drakul’s name has been coming up more often recently. I don’t like it.""

On Faith Astor:  ""I wonder, did I have any positive impact in her life?""

Addendum to the earlier point on the government:  ""If the Government ever gets wise to the supernatural in a big way, I suspect things will get Real Bad, Real Fast.""

I'd file this one under *things that could still shake Harry to the core*.  ""The more I think about Mom fleeing Lord Raith—and abandoning Thomas to him—and the Outsider thing and meeting my Dad, I worry about it all just being a set-up. Like, did she really love him? Did she really love me?""

That more or less covers it, though I may have missed some.  Dig in!Wow.  29 hits you like a brick with Nick tricking Murphy into making the sword vulnerable, and breaking it.  When you're rooting for the good guys, that really hurts (damnit Butters...).

Then 30 comes and Michael proves why he's a Knight of the Cross, completely selfless and badass at the same time.  Plus Uriel getting involved (the imagery between Uriel and Nick was great) by healing Michael.

Some top notch stuff.Playing through CoS in my Adventurer's League group.  This has been my first group playing D&D, so I'm still relatively new.  We're playing with the Dark Gifts, and because my level 1 char joined after the ""season"" started, he has died... well quite a lot, and has come back.

He has grown from naive and well-intentioned (if rebellious to his family) noble to a cynical and well-intentioned champion for ""the right thing"".

He hasn't died in many sessions now, and has become fairly capable at strategy (damage dealing is a bit iffy still, but he's a squishy Bard and more RP focused than minmaxed).  He has been researching methods to cope and augment his Dark Gifts to achieve his goals.  Priority number one is learning how to easily and repeatedly cast Disguise Self, which has him focused on becoming a Warlock, to gain access to some eldritch invocations.  Because he's been exposed to the power of Jenny Greenteeth, and because he [retroactively] was interested in Faerie tales as a child (I did have him focus on history and lore, so its not *that* far off), he already has his eyes set upon a his Patron, Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness, and of the Unseelie Court.^^1

Anyway, today he died for the first time in a while.  When he died, and his consciousness floated in the void for Strahd to torment before returning him with a gift, he attempted to intimidate the master of Barovia.

Strahd:  ""You again?  It has been a while...""

Ancan:  ""Strahd!  I have come to bargain!  I hereby swear that should you continue your ways, I will strike you down with all power I may gather.  I have learned much of the Fae, and I will appeal to Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness, and with the support I gain I will seek you out and see that justice be done to you!""

Strahd just stared, then my body re-knit itself and my consciousness returned to my body.

OOC, my DM had me call high or low, then he rolled behind a screen.  He wrote something down.  Then I gained a Dark Gift as per the usual rules.  I can't wait to find out what this means.

1.  This may or may not also be related to the fact that I'm on a Dresden Files re-read binge."

FullRamen,6,7,"Setting aside the bugs that have come up recently....

The so-called UASF code adds a new rule that any blocks whose timestamp falls within a particular one-month window must signal support for SegWit.

Miners who are hostile to segwit will find that the following strategy is in their interest:

> There are about 4032 blocks in a month.  Starting more than 4032 seconds (an hour) before the UASF window, miners who do not want segwit should mine blocks which increment the timestamp by one second instead of using the actual time.  All these blocks will be outside the ""UASF month"" so do not need to signal for segwit.  Two hours worth of one-second blocktime increments leaves plenty of space to orphan any segwit-signalling blocks mined by the minority during the ""UASF month"", so the majority hashpower maintains control as intended by Nakamoto Consensus.

This requires no cabals or active collusion.  It simply requires that 51% of the miners do not wish to activate segwit and have heard about this strategy.

It is well known that bitcoin's byzantine agreement does not include time-of-day.  The timestamps on blocks are just for bookkeeping, and a sort of commitment scheme for tracking difficulty adjustments.  **Basing any sort of security property other than difficulty adjustment on the block timestamps is just foolish.**  Miners already know this; after all their use of rollNtime is why we have acausal blocks in the chain.

*There is a small downside that the network will see two periods of what look like outrageously high hashrate.  Fortunately the difficulty adjustments are capped (at 4x, I believe).  Having the difficulty artificially jump by 16x will be expensive for the miners, and the 2.6-hour blocktime for the next 2016 blocks afterward will be irritating for users.  This can be partially mitigated if the UASF month is 180 degrees out of phase with the difficulty adjustment cycle; then only one adjustment period falls entirely within the ""uberhashing"" window*

Edit: technically the signaling requirement is imposed on blocks if the median of the timestamp on the previous 11 blocks falls in the window.  Doesn't matter.  If no block are mined with timestamps in the ""UASF month"" then no block will ever have the median of the previous 11 timestamps in the window.

Edit: untranspose words.For those who don't know: Nigel Farage is a British politician, frequently critical of the establishment, who does stuff like getting himself elected to the very political bodies he despises and then [using his allotted speaking time to lambaste, castigate, and otherwise completely rip them to shreds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyq7WRr_GPg&t=0m09s).

I have determined that **Peter Todd is his cryptographical heir and reincarnation.**

As evidence, I put forth Todd's latest [masterpiece](https://petertodd.org/2016/cypherpunk-desert-bus-zcash-trusted-setup-ceremony), highlighting the following gems:

* ""the entire ceremony is a bunch of crypto hocus pocus""

* ""I’ve had some experts tell me they thought the security level was 2^80 operations (very weak)""

* ""In my opinion the Zcash team has been irresponsible, maybe even dishonest, in their choice of block interval and size parameters.""

* He has [anti-ninja alarms](https://petertodd.org/assets/2016-11-14/quesnel-motel-anti-ninja-alarm.jpg)

* ""the Equihash paper never actually properly analysed the actual cost of implementing Equihash on real hardware""

* ""We haven’t even discussed more exotic possibilities like custom DRAM ASICs""

* He reenacts the Office Space printer beatdown [with a blowtorch and a pair of pliers](https://petertodd.org/assets/2016-11-14/compute-node-ram-remains.jpg).

* ""But there’s a big potential problem: because this hardware may be significantly more expensive to develop than SHA256 ASICs, we may end up with a winner-take-all situation where the first firm to develop a Equihash ASIC has a massive head start over its competitors. Exactly what Equihash was trying to avoid.""

And then he suffixes all this awesomeness by turning his participation in the zcash signing ceremony into a hiking/industrial-sightseeing junket.  I can imagine him thinking *yeah zookoo, I really really really need to drive through these picturesque mountains in a car rented on your dime in order to properly execute the curve point multiplications*...This is borderline absurd.

Zcash is supposed to launch in six days, and there is still no accounting of the operational details of how the ""trusted setup"" will/was occur and what parties were involved.

> We're working on the engineering and operational details of how to implement that secure multiparty computation, using a set of well-known, trusted people to serve as the participants.

There is some (massively oversimplified) math [here](https://z.cash/blog/snark-parameters.html#what-else-can-we-do) but still zero information on who the Trusted People are or why we should trust them.

Current exchange rate is 3.1337JTUs/BTC.  Any takers?Hi, where can I find a nice graph of the XMR-USD (not XMR-BTC) rate for the last month that doesn't completely suck?

BTC-USD has bitcoinwisdom, which is incredibly awesome.

The graphs on monero.net (like [this one](http://monero.net/xmr_usd.html)) are useless because they put the trading volume and price on the same y-axis, so the price is always a horizontal line.  Too bad, because aside from that they are so nice and clean and you can bookmark the graph directly; click the bookmark see the graph, no javascript garbage or scrolling past ads (ads are fine as long as I don't have to scroll past them).

Coinmarketcap seems to have graphs only for XMR-BTC, and even those are so polluted with crap-ads and javascript that they're useless.  Literally, the graph is off the bottom of the window, I have to scroll down to get to it.  Not usable for something I need to check frequently.

Coingecko has the same obnoxious graph-is-five-scrolling-actions-away problem.  And this ridiculous javascript popup.  And you can't link directly to the charge as a gif/png/jpeg (like you can with reasonable sites).  Ads are fine as long as they don't get in the way.

> I assert that the ultimate metric of miner code efficiency will be the amount of DRAM memory bandwidth available (i.e. either used or wasted) during the time required to find one solution, measured in bits per solution.  Smaller numbers are better.

If Equihash were perfectly DRAM-memory-bound (not true) and on-die cache were not useful for Equihash (also not true) and if GPUs were 100% efficient at scheduling memory transactions (almost never true) then this would be exactly equal to the DRAM memory traffic required to find a solution, which -- assuming radix sorting -- is about 1.7 * 16gbit=27.2gbit (*).  So a given miner kernel's ""memory traffic possible during time required to find a solution"" figure is a measure of the degree to which these ""not true"" assumptions fail -- in other words, how well it schedules and utilizes the two scarce resources: off-chip DRAM  bandwidth and the on-die cache space.  Perfect utilization of DRAM bandwidth but absolutely no utilization of onchip cache and radix sorting would give a figure of 27.2gbit.

(*) where 1.7 is the approximate number of solutions per hash; I understand there is some debate about the exact figure but it is generally accepted to within +/- 10%

However, I get pinged pretty frequently and find myself QCing shoes for people who don't even take the time to say thank you.  Yes, I hate having any sense of entitlement, but I have a full-time job amongst other responsibilities - and I am taking time out of my day to make sure the shoes you get are to your liking.  The same goes for the people who you are asking for a QC.  We are all humans here - allowing for you guys to get free quality checks and legit checks.  (I am on the receiving side of free legit checks, and am thankful I have a free point of reference).

Howisthisaname,5,3,"Over the past few months we've gotten a lot of new players asking where they should start with the trilogy. With this stickied thread, I'm hoping to answer any questions someone may have about getting into the series.

**Note: This thread is a strictly no-spoiler zone.**

#What are the MOTHER games?

The MOTHER series is a group of 3 turn-based cult classic JRPGs created by [Shigesato Itoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigesato_Itoi), who singlehandedly wrote every line of dialogue in the series, aside from a small area in EarthBound.

---

#What makes them so special?

The series is known for being quirky, charming, and invoking a sense of nostalgia even to those who have not played a MOTHER game before. Each line of dialogue is expertly crafted, with a great story to go along with it.

---

#Where do I start?

The series **IS** a trilogy, however each game can stand on it's own without the context of the last.

**The 3 games are as followed:**

MOTHER **(EarthBound: Beginnings)** (1989)

MOTHER 2 **(EarthBound)** (1994)

MOTHER 3 **(???) (Not released outside of Japan)** (2006)

The game order is as released, with MOTHER being the first on the timeline, and MOTHER 3 being the last.

---

#So does that mean I should play the games in order?

This is a point of contention within the MOTHER community.

While most recommend to play EarthBound / MOTHER 2 first, some will say that if you can handle the way an older RPG plays, you should start with MOTHER 1 / EarthBound: Beginnings.

The community mostly unanimously agrees that you should play EarthBound before playing MOTHER 3.

In the end, it's up to you. MOTHER 1 is one of the most impressive, best playing and sounding RPGs on the NES, but it could potentially turn you away from the series if you aren't accustomed to or can't handle a bit of older-rpg ""clunk"". I do HIGHLY recommend however that you at least play EarthBound before playing MOTHER 3.

---

#Wait, if MOTHER 3 isn't released outside of Japan, how can I play it?

I'm glad you asked! (Hopefully you did.)

Almost immediately after the release of MOTHER 3, once it became apparent Nintendo had no intention of localizing MOTHER 3, a group of very passionate fans got together to make their own localization of the game.

2 years later in late 2008, version 1.0 was released to great acclaim. This [fan translation](http://mother3.fobby.net/) is now known to many as the best fan translation of all time. On top of just translating the game, they went out of their way to make sure certain dialogue and enemy names worked in English as they do in Japanese. They even added a hard mode option!

---

...That's pretty much it, I think. If any regular here on the sub wants to chime in and request something to be added, tell me! On top of that, I'd like to know what some of you think the best order to play the games in are in the comments. It'll be an interesting resource for any new players! And remember, **no spoilers.**"

jbnw17,6,8,"This title caught me, and I believe alot of people, off guard. I hadn't even heard about this game until recently, and after a little research I knew this game had definite potential. 

The scale of the map is what impressed me the most, and I have had hours of fun exploring it by myself and with others. 
From gliding in a wing-suit meters off the ground to finding a awesome line down a mountain packed with natural features to hit!

My most memorable moment so far was when I was just exploring random areas before spotting a dam in the distance, and then realising I could actually 'just go there'. Once I finally reached the top of the dam and was visualising the ultimate route down while snowboarding, another player arrived at the dam and we ended a partying up for the next couple of hours and we had a blast just doing whatever we wanted.

Honestly credit to you guys at Ubisoft, as this was a real shot in the dark and you probably had no idea how many people would even be interested in a game like this. But due to being in a genre of its own and being so different to any other game out there, i believe it will be successful and will prove to be a risky venture you won't regret.

SEE YOU ON THE SLOPES!Just want to know your guys thoughts, as I have been without a GPU for a month and I want to know how realistic it is to have an RX480 shipped on the 29th.I will overclock the R5 to an OC which is a good balance of extra fps/temps/voltage.

I have a 120T deepcool maelstrom CPU cooler that is being used on the i5 at the moment (not really needed for this cpu I know).

RAM I am using:

16GB 2133Mhz DDR4 (Hyper X Fury)

Am thinking about the switch because I want to support AMD and the cost to switch will not be large due to being able to sell the cpu for a decent amount in my country, than buying the R5 new from the USA. Let me know if ram would need to be upgraded as well.

Also keep in mind that I will be upgrading to vega if they bring out a GPU = to the GTX 1070 with reference liquid cooling.

Currently waiting for an AM4+ mini-itx board with on board wifi that has overclocking support.

All helpful replies are appreciated.

djml9,9,9,"Ive noticed alot of people complaining about their character only checking the watch for a split second. The reason is that there is a “Watch Interact” gesture and a ”Check Watch” gesture. The default gesture changes depending on what watch you're using. 

The Tomagunchi has multiple functions, so the default is “Watch Interact”. This is used to change modes or otherwise interact with the watch. That means you have to go to Barracks>Identity>Sprays and Gestures and set the “Check Watch” gesture onto one of your slots. 

If you equip a watch that only has 1 function, the default will switch over to “Check Watch”.They added it in to both Assassin’s Creed (origins, and moreso odyssey), as well as Far Cry in New Dawn. I dont like the whole leveled weapons because shooting someone 30-50 times makes no sense and isnt fun. It works in the division because that game is full rpg, but i dont want it in Far Cry or Ghost Recon."
paskizx31,9,5,"I suddenly looked at my Macbook Air’s camera while unlocking the device. Then, I thought of something - would it be beneficial for Macs to have the FaceID technology?

Do some people in the community would like to see new iterations of Mac to adopt the FaceID technology?I’m currently replaying the series, and now at The Lost Age (TLA) (or Book 2). The introductory text told, in a gist, the start of Alchemy and how it was eventually sealed away *by few wise men* in order to save the world from destruction. I then realized that a prequel game can be made from the few texts flashed in the introduction of TLA – expanding the summary to a new exciting game.

In the prequel, I’m imagining that **all** (including NPCs and enemies) are knowledgeable and able to use Psynergy; though, yes enemies are able to use Psynergy way back in Book 1, but not all. The story will revolve around the *few wise men* achieving to seal away Alchemy. The world of Weyard is in a state of war. The continents of Angara and Gondowan look a bit different with settlements unknown compared to the previous installments. Mt. Aleph could already be there, but no Sol Sanctum and Vale yet since Alchemy’s yet to be sealed and be guarded. Lemuria could be a bustling city, in contrast to TLA’s portrayal of Lemuria. Lunpa could appear as *the noble thief*, not a city named after the character.

In my opinion, this could bring the glory of Golden Sun back.Wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas! Have a delicious and satisfying Noche Buena this Christmas Eve 😊 God bless all.

Happy Birthday Jesus Christ 😊🙏"

-Dynamic-,10,7,"Morty's are used as a cloke for Rick's, but how did they hide before morty's? And wouldn't there be some other life form that cancels out Rick's brainwaves too? I've been watching some Youtubers who are in NA/EU and they seem to play at a different a skill level compared to their ranks than I'm used to. Is it a real thing? Does NA DMG mean a different skill group as SA DMG? What could be causing this?This is relatively trivial, but I need an answer. 

Our school started the iPad program last year, but bandwidth has been a constant issue. 15mbps over more than 1000 devices doesn't go very well. Since then, we have moved over to 100mbps, and are still having issues. They're blaming that our phone-hosted Hotspots are interfering with the signal from the APs causing the Internet to tank, and if we host data Hotspots from our mobiles out devices will be blacklisted. 

So my questions are:

1: Can  mobile Hotspots interfere with industrial APs in a saturated place? Or are they just shifting the blame of crappy bandwidth?

2: can they identify our devices from mobile Hotspots and blacklist them based on that identification? In the original 6 movies (and seven to quite an extent) we are all heavily exposed to the force. At least one main character and one adversary can use it. Its commonplace, we always see it, so we expect it to become normal. in R1, me, not knowing the canon, thought that gyn erso was a jedi at the beginning. Guy with long hair hiding on some distant planet? JEDI! because that's what I'm so used to seeing. As the movie progressing without seeing jedi you kind of get used to it, and it didnt cross my mind much. 

The introductory scene of darth vader really made it though. It surprises so much when Krennick starts choking. 

TL:DR The lack of force users in rogue one gives me a much better appreciation for themThe legend of Korra deals with, in my opinion, the two most interesting subjects in the first two seasons. However, they really get brushed over so quickly I don't care. The season one ark deals with a rising resentment from non-benders to benders, grows a massively powerful resistance, the  just instantaneously falls apart when their leader dies. I'm sorry, I just can't see it. The story would have been much, much better if they expanded the ark a second season and dealed with the aftermath that way, also meaning you didn't have to cramp the action and story into 14 episodes would allow for much, much, much better character depth.( E. G. Akami still feels tacked on until the final episodes of s4.) I'm not sure how they would change it to fit two seasons, but it's probably the most interesting of the ""political"" arks.

From there, I think the season 2 ark could have and should have been stretched into two or even three seasons. Learning about the avatars nature in two episodes was great, but there's no build up to the payoff fight. It felt hilariously empty to me. Seeing it become more... More would be great. I loved the early dynamics and the way her uncle manipulated her, but it shouldve had more... Gravity. 

Don't get me started on season 3 and 4. 4 was an interesting concept but by that time you'd seen the formula so often you knew how it would play out and didn't care, and while the whole ""rebuilding the air nation"" aspect was very interesting IMO in s3 the bad guys where so tacked on it wasn't even fucking funny. I don't remember their names, other that they all where special benders and anarchists. In S4 they should've at least had the balls to mako and Bolin. I felt that the only good thing out of both of those season was boomie airbending and meeting toff again. 

TL:DR the themes of B1 and B2 of Korra where far more interesting and should have been explored further. Their expanded arks would have both become two seasons long, replacing season 3's and 4's arks."
qwertythe300th,10,2,"So I just had a god awful Tinder Date, and the highlight of this shit show was this girl showing me a bunch of Punk Music she really enjoyed. She had playlists on playlists but this song stuck to me. I was befuddled. I've heard Morse Code that could carry a better tune than this song. She thought it was fucking art.

Anyway. I told my friend about this song and she DESPERATELY wanted to hear what this thing was, but when the Date looked it up it was on my Xbox YouTube with no account so the search didn't save anywhere.


Here's what I know...

- I *believe* this song is form the 2000s, maybe late 90s but pretty sure 2000s
- The Album cover is mostly white, but I think there was some Blue/Red/Pink on it
- It was supposed to be punk or screamo? **[UPDATE] The genre is most likely called ""Noise Music""**
- The first minute of the song is straight up an earrape of warbled staticy noise. I can best describe it as a Dialup Connection put through a Blender with the ""Add Noise"" setting turned up to the max
- EDIT: There's no tempo or drumbeat, there is no semblance of rhythm that you could tap your foot to
- EDIT: The song has 0 semblance of an instrument. There's no guitar, no drums or piano or anything. Just sounds like Static & Screaming
- about 1:30 through the song, someone starts screaming, not singing. Just screaming. They're saying words and verses but it's not to any tune or beat. It just sounds like a painful cry for help
- The song is about 6-8 Minutes long. For all I know the song gets better but I could only make it though 2 and a half minutes before I had to beg for mercy.


This song is vile, but man. I wanna find it so I can send it to people I don't like and to fascinate people who I do 😅. Thank you all in advance and I hope y'all are having a good new year

EDIT: holy shit. 53 Responses I need to read. AT LEAST ONE OF THESE will be the song. Surely. Thank y'all so much!!

EDIT 2: I would ask her but my ass got blocked lmao, shit was awkward.

EDIT 3: I've woken up to over 100 more songs to check out. Thank you so much y'all, this is crazy overwhelming lol, I'm fairly busy but  I'm gonna make sure I get to everyone here over the next couple days and listen to all of y'all's trash! At least one of y'all have THE song!"

I have poured many hours into this, trying to get it as accurate as I possibly can with the real time options. Obviously these can be changed according to your own game or if an injury occurs in WWE for example.



I have included a few essential wrestlers in WWE that aren't on the game (Ciampa/Kendrick etc), so you'll have to download those if you want them, or remove them.



I haven't added anyone's attributes as I don't know them all and you may end up changing them anyway lol.



Finally, I had to join 205 Live up with NxT in regards to hosting ppv's, since as far I know, it's still only 2 shows hosting per ppv.



Hope you guys enjoy this, I have used word documents for many years, but after making this, it will be so much easier to edit lol. =)Presuming Reigns win the Universal title at Mania, Moxley holds onto the AEW World title until the summer, there's a good chance Rollins could win the WWE world title again by Summerslam. We could have all 3 members as world champions respectively. Pretty crazy!The build up to mania from the rumble left me feeling like I was going off WWE. I stopped watching raw and smackdown live each week and would just skip through episodes or the whole show sometimes. I went into Mania weekend with low expectations. However, after this past week I've loved every part of each show with the debuts/announcements etc and can't wait for next week and going forward. So thank you WWE for luring me back in when I felt like I was falling off the wagon. Drew McIntyre was a big surprise last year, I don't remember reading anything about him coming back, so I wonder if there could be any surprises tonight? Since they showed War Machine and Ricochet who had already been announced as signed beforehand, perhaps they  might show Dijak? Maybe Keith Lee?I really believe he will, he was the stand out of the whole tournament and one of the best British wrestlers out there atm. Who do you guys think will win/Bate to keep in for the time being. "

So my question is are their different grades of soapiness, or do other ingredients bring the flavor out more or cover it up (usually when I'm using cilantro the dish is very acidic)I bought one of those aluminum blocks that's supposed to help take the scent off your hands after working with garlic and onions. I used it for the first time yesterday and it didn't seem to work. So I tried again, several times throughout today and yesterday and I can still smell onions strongly as I type this on my phone."

securitywyrm,10,7,"Death claws lose a lot of their intimidation value when you kill one in the tutorial. I think back to a question Fallout 1 where you go to kill a wounded one in a cave and it's a hard fight. I think the death claw would have been far more intimidating if

1. The deathclaw starts as ""wounded"" from fighting raiders.
2. It has ""wounded"" in the name, indicating it's not a full strength death claw.
3. It runs away once you knock down about 20% of it's health. You don't get to kill a death claw in the tutorial.

I think this would have preserved the mystery of death claws, such that most players experience with them would be frantically spraying minigun fire until it decides you're not worth the trouble, not fighting to the death.Way back in 2002, I was hosting some of my early ""real"" DMing experiences, and got together a group of 4 players who were all business majors. Early in their adventure, they encountered a tavern that had been abandoned because of nearby monsters. They defeated the monsters, moved into the tavern, and then things got weird.

Over the next two hours they

* Made asset sheets of everything in the tavern
* Put together a business plan of how to revitalize the tavern
* Evaluated their character abilities for maximum revenue

The next 5 sessions (about 15 hours) was the party making engineering plans to expand the tavern, negotiating with suppliers, hiring staff, and OCCASIONALLY going out to slay monsters for more loot to continue their quest to build the best tavern. They were making design plans on 1/4 grid paper then taking it to kinkos to blow up to 1"" grids and having meetings to discuss layouts to optimize customer flow.

This was not the story I intended. They abandoned the actual main quest regarding a fey lord, but they were SO HAPPY using their 'business knowledge' to build a tavern in a D&D game that I couldn't bring myself to push them back onto the adventure. After 5 sessions (which was a good ending time due to changing schedules), I declared that they had succeeded and they were quite happy with having ""won"" at business in D&D.

So that's how a group of business majors ""beat"" a D&D game.Since we're able to make antimatter of various elements, if we made antimatter of a radioactive element, how would what it radiates differ from normal radioactive material?He'd have made a great small arms dealer.Because they don't believe in higher powers.

(Before you laugh at others, you must be able to laugh at yourself)This occurred at a store that involves colored shirts. I was working a summer job there, mostly hawking the in-store credit card but also doing cashier stuff when there was a crush. The instructions for the sale of alcohol were as follows

* Scan their ID
* Enter their birth date into the field that pops up on the computer

This was the extent of the instructions. An elderly lady comes in, clearly old enough to be my grandmother, and like an obedient minimum wage employee I ask for her ID. She gets quite mad at me, demanding to know why I want to see her ID, not accepting the reason I give and then repeating the demand. Eventually I call for help from the ""head cashier"" who apologizes for my ""being new"" and finishes the transaction.

THEN they tell me that you can press F11 to bypass the age verification screen if someone is clearly old enough that you don't need to check their ID.This was a high-level online D&D campaign I was running a long time ago, about level 13. I like to run LARGE online games, with 6-7 players for 4-5 hour sessions. The online format makes handling that many people fairly easy, as multiple people can talk at once in a conversation and I kept combat running smoothly through various tools.

I had a player who was dissatisfied with the amount of personal attention he was getting. For example when the party went to meet with the leaders of the elf nation, he skipped the meeting to ""wander the forest and pray."" He was then upset when nothing happend from him wandering the forest and praying while everyone else was roleplaying at a very important metting. So he hatches a plan. Despite my firm ""Do not split the party, and you will never be penalized for keeping the party together"" rule, he kept insisting on splitting away and trying to get one on one attention.

He gets another player, a person he knew from outside the game, on board with his plan. Their characters would betray and attack the party, because if there were fewer players they would get more attention. I should clarify at this point that I'm confident these were both adults, because I required a phone number be provided to join my game (children can't give out their phone number to strangers over the internet).

As the party is dividing some treasure after a difficult encounter, and the two players do their betrayal, attacking the other party members (who were low on health after the combat), killing one. However they underestimated the coordination of the other party members, and were forced to flee. The party was rather taken aback by this sudden turn of events, seeing as the two party members who betrayed them were a half-celestial paladin and a gold dragon. The remaining party members take their fallen party member to get a resurrection, and the session is over.

I then get a message from the player who led the betrayal.

Him: ""Hey, so when is our next session?""  
Me: ""Their next session is the same time next week. Clearly, your character is no longer a part of that group.""  
Him: ""Right, so me and (otherplayer) are available at 5pm on Saturdays.""  
Me: ""That's good for you, why are you telling me that?""  
Him: ""So we can play our characters!""  

He genuinely thought that if he and another player permanently split from the group, that I had to host an entire new campaign for those characters. He was ""less than pleased"" when told of his misconception, claiming I was ""abandoning my duties as a DM"" and threatened to report me to the admins of the chat server. The player he had convinced to go along with his plan came to me pleading to be let back in, because the head betrayer had convinced him that I would host a new campaign just for them if they quit the other group, and even shared the chat logs of them planning it and everything he was promised. He was not let back in.

The icing on the cake: This game was VERY popular. We'd have several people just watching the game every week, and there was a waiting list to join the game. When those two left, I had two replacement players by the end of the day from people who had been there to watch the game. The characters of the betrayers became antagonists and the half-celestial paladin was the 'final boss' of the campaign, having given in to the temptations of the far realms. The party killing him was one of the most satisfying combats I have ever run, as the players were 'oddly passionate' about killing that fallen paladin. 

Edit: For those asking, this was on IRC in 2011. While that specific D&D community faded away, the current ""active"" IRC D&D group is on irc.freenode.net in #D&D . "

Are pumps ever used in Australian houses to increase shower water pressure?

It was very common in Ireland but they also used to have roof tanks whereas we seem mostly to rely on mains pressure.

I was wondering if it's worth investigating, or will a plumber look at me like I am stupid if I get them in?

By far the worst symptom of my ADHD of any of them, is the intermittent inability to speak words that I normally know.  
Ending up having to pause and search my brain for a word I have said many times, know the meaning of, but absolutely cannot get it from my brain to my tongue.

Does anyone have any resources you can use to actually find those words when this happens?

A thesaurus is useless, as while I can explain the word I am looking for they only do alternate words.

Its too unstructured for google.

Often I find talking it out with someone works, but then you are stuck with them wondering why you forgot such a simple word.Well it looks like they still havent fixed that hole yet then.

* Keyboard kit (case, plate, PCB) 
* Switches
* Stabilizers

Then, I build it either on stream or on a video recording to your specifications, and I send it back to you in the same box, with all of the extra parts and components. No keyset required, I can use my own for the build for testing purposes. **I do not charge a fee for this service**, but you are responsible for the shipping in both directions. For reference, with PirateShip, I've shipped entire builds clear across the country for around $13 fully insured. Additionally, if you do not want to provide your own lube, I may ask you to PayPal me no more than $1 for the use of my personal lube (stuff's expensive!).

**NOTE:** I am obviously not responsible for damage that is incurred during shipping. I generally take lots of pictures and a video of myself packaging my mechmarket items when I send them out, so this will be a known quantity when the board is handed off to USPS. I highly recommend you fully insure your packages in both directions. 

**General notes:**

* I will take meticulous photos/videos of the condition of the board on receipt and before sending, for your protection and mine
* Entire build will be recorded 
* I will not lube your switches for free
* I am anal about the condition and build quality of my own stuff, and I will be the same way about yours

**Boards I've built so far:**

* Mill-maxed WT60-D
* Holetited WT60-D (I do not under any circumstances recommend holtites - this was a pain in the ass) 
* Several Mekanisk Klippe builds, both hotswap and soldered
* RAMA Koyu
* IDB60
* ai03 Equinox
* ai03 Vega
* ai03 Meridian
* CannonKeys Brutal60, Savage65, Obliterated75
* CannonKeys Ortho60 (Through-hole, bluepill-based ortho practice kit) 
* Voice65
* Space65
* Time80 OG

Outside of this, I have quite a bit of soldering experience from my time as a CpE major, which is where I originally learned to solder.

**My equipment:**

* X-Tronic 4010-XTS-2 Soldering station
* Kester 63/37 leaded solder (leaded solder desolders incredibly well)
* Hakko FR-301

**What's next?**
Fill out this [Google form](https://forms.gle/WxFtpD6iYcY3TrHv8), do the regular mechmarket stuff (send me a PM and comment on the thread) and I will get back to you ASAP.You are a treasure among this community. I love and appreciate you for all of the wonderful products that you've brought to market, the speed at which you ship my addiction fuel, and your open communication with the community.

Thanks Mike <3

P.S. ne 7v tracking number availHey folks,

I drive a 1999 Nissan Altima with ~95k miles on it. I've had the car for about 5 years now and it's served me very well. This week I went on a trip to California for work and rented a 2016 Altima. It's a great car, but for some reason it just felt really... touchy, I guess? Over 70 MPH or so it just kind of felt kind of squirrelly and unstable, especially so when accelerating (when passing a truck for example).

Are all new cars like this? I think I can attribute it to the steering sensitivity (I believe it's a ""steer by wire"" system), but I'm not sure. When I drive my car, it has a bit more feel to it, and I can make small adjustments on the steering wheel without it having a huge effect on the overall path of the car. 

Wondering mostly out of curiosity, as I haven't driven very many new cars. The most recent one was a 2009 Altima that my mom bought brand new. I didn't have the same experience with that car.Interested in picking this up during the summer sale. Seems like it's been in Early Access for quite some time. Is it still being supported/improved upon, or is it kind of in its final state?[A neat picture with my car in the background](http://i.imgur.com/IdZ8vr2.jpg)


2014 Ninja 300 with 1500 miles. Guy was moving to a different state and looking to sell quick, so I got it for $3600. Going rate around here is $4k+. I'm loving it! I've wanted the 300 for quite a long time and now I finally have one.

It's a pretty clean specimen. Shifts through all of the gears beautifully, no strange engine noises, everything is a-okay. It needs a chain adjustment and I'll probably do an oil change too, but it's pretty much ready to go.

If you guys can think of anything else I should do before I consider it ""ready to go,"" let me know. I'd love to hear from some more experienced folks.
My girlfriend is 5’0” and I’m having trouble finding a wetsuit that would fit her based on the size charts. Her hips and chest are typically larger than the height provides. 

Any good brands make petite sizes for people like her?

Vorthas,9,7,"I'm actually quite curious as to the general philosophy of world-refusal.

I found this by Kirkbride on the Imperial Library

> Dwarves were the ultimate Bartleby's of the universe: whenever it asked something of them they simply 'would rather not.' Let me take this a step further and say *Dwarves regularly practiced the perception of acausal effects*. Dwarves knew that phenomena (that which can be perceived by the senses) and noumena (that which is the thing-itself) were both illusions, with the second one just being more clever. *Dwarves could divide by zero*. There isn't even a word to describe the Dwarven view on divinity. *They were atheists on a world where gods exist.*

Is this basically [anti-realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism) that includes both phenomena and noumena?  If not, then is there any real-world philosophy that is similar to the dwemer's world-view?"

RGabrielShih,1,2,"Hi everyone, 

As promised, here is a short guide on how multimillionaires and powerful people use a different type of networking to create opportunities and how use can use that same style to create opportunities for yourself. Sorry it took so long, I know some people were waiting for this. If you want to read more stuff on how the people in Hollywood network or how the rich and powerful network, check out my other posts.

Why Networking is so Important:
A friend from Reddit had a great observation that a lot of people aren’t aware of the importance of networking. Basically, the “WHY?” of networking. ‘Why is it so important?’. So, for the past week, I’ve been thinking about how I can communicate this clearly (which is why this post is delayed - sorry). And this is what I’ve come up with: Opportunity always comes from other people. Everything that happens to you as an entrepreneur, you get a huge deal, you find mentors, you meet investors, VCs, a huge joint venture, all of these opportunities depend on other people and quality of your relationship with them.

You can have all the skill in the world. You can work 80 hours a week. Your company could be the next big thing. But if you never get an opportunity, all that talent, hard work and potential is wasted. 

Most people have no idea how to find these opportunities. They think opportunities are random. They just sit there, waiting for opportunity to knock, thinking there’s nothing they can do about it. That all they have to do is to focus on their company or product and opportunity will find them. Other people go out to networking events, collect business cards, make calls and try to set up meetings. These people are basically shooting in the dark. They know they have to go out and find opportunity, but they don’t know how or where to find it. The difference between ‘traditional networking’ and ‘rich and powerful networking’ is the difference between ‘going out into the forest, hoping to find food’ and ‘building a farm’. The rich and powerful grow and cultivate opportunities. They have an overabundance of opportunities. They never have to go out and ‘hunt’ for it. 

I’ve met so many talented and hard-working entrepreneurs across the country. All of them with amazing ideas and companies. But most of these people never get a chance, they never get their opportunity. I see them years, even decades, later still doing the same thing they did before, no progress whatsoever, still waiting for their big break, for their big opportunity. 

This is what networking like the rich and the powerful is: it’s building a garden of opportunities. Planting those seeds so that when you need it, you won’t have to depend on chance. 


First, a little about me: 
I used to work in the corporate world. I predicted the dot.com crash back in college so my first job out of undergrad was for two VPs at a multibillion dollar international company. I was two levels away from the CEO. Went on to work for a few other multibillion dollar divisions then moved to Los Angeles to help family. 

Decided to take a break, made some friends with people in the industry and started helping them with their projects (pro bono consulting). No one big at this time. Word spread and I started meeting new people and making new friends. Some of my new friends were very connected in the industry. I started learning from them a different style of networking and socializing. As I started to meet more and more powerful people in Hollywood I noticed that the “higher up” I went the more people were using this style (as opposed to the people lower down who were using the traditional style of networking that we are all taught). 

Later, I had the chance to earn my MBA in a year with a full scholarship so I moved to Boston. That’s when I started making friends with angel investors, VCs and, in general, wealthy people and noticed that they used the same style of networking and socializing that Hollywood did. In general, I’ve noticed that the people who were wealthier and more powerful tend to use this system. 

For most people, this style of networking and socializing is learned over decades of trial and error. Which is why it’s primarily used by the rich and the powerful: they were the ones who put decades of practiceinto it. The other types of people who know this type of socializing and networking are the children who were born into these families. I've known children of the very wealthy and very powerful across the country who are very good at this (there are exceptions, though, as you can gather from the news). 

It’s helped me, not just professionally but personally as well (it's the reason I met most of my friends and, most importantly, my wife). I’ve taught it to others (I was a business consultant, some business owners needed help networking and socializing) and it’s helped them professionally and personally as well.


Typically, I teach this to people in-person. I take them out to events like Hollywood parties or fashion shows or mingling events with wealthy people and I work with them face-to-face. Because of this I'm able to customize how they learn. This is usually over a period of months. I can't do that here so instead what I'll do is give some general tips on how wealthy and powerful people network as well as some specific info on wealthy people. 

Before we get into how to network and socialize like the top people do, there are some foundational things I want to set up.


First thing I want to say is that this is not some magic technique, trick or social hack to persuade people to get your way. This a method of networking and socializing that took the wealthy and the powerful decades to figure out. The sad truth is that networking and socializing is just as complex as leadership and strategy. We devote courses and majors to those subjects but the most networking gets is maybe a book here or there or just an article that says the same old advice that is really sales, not networking. The stuff I'm showing you here is the same stuff that typically takes people decades of trial and error to figure out. I was just lucky to learn it early. 
Networking and socializing does not replace hard work and dedication. I said earlier how talent and hardwork is wasted if there is never any opportunity to use it. At the same time, without talent and hard work, you’ll never do anything with those opportunities. Networking and socializing like the rich and like how the top people in LA do it will just give you the same opportunities that they get. However, whether you take advantage of those opportunities and what you do with them is up to you. 
Very important: never use people. Never try to con people or try to get their money. I’ve seen some people use unsavory tactics to get ahead in life. And they do get an early headstart because of it. However, I never met anyone at the top who was like this. Why? You can only get to a certain level working by yourself. There’s a point where you need to work with others in order to break through to the next level. And if you’ve been using people or conning them, then by the time you reach that level you will have built up a bad reputation that will keep you from the top levels. The wealthy and the powerful are smart. They didn't get to where they are by being poor judges of character. And the thing they value most of all is personal trust. Violate that and you will lose everything. I’ve seen people who were at the top of their game lose everything because they did something untrustworthy or stabbed someone in the back. 
As you socialize with more and more people at higher levels it becomes your RESPONSIBILITY to protect their privacy. It is basically your job to be a gatekeeper for them and vet anyone you introduce to them. It goes both ways: they will do the same for you. For instance, as I started meeting higher up people in LA and bringing some of my friends to exclusive parties they would tell some of their friends about the people I knew and was hanging out with. I would then get random head shots, scripts and pitches sent to my email. I had to ask my friends to stop talking about me or who I knew. As for the people who pitched me out of nowhere, I blocked them. Their approach was completely wrong as I'll explain later. Don't name the names of your friends and don't give away their contact info. Respect their privacy. 
Don't believe in the stereotypes of the wealthy. Most depictions of wealthy people are that they are racist, selfish, snobby and that their children are lazy and only want to party. None of this is true. The only people who believe this are people who never met a multimillionaire or multibillionaire in their life. Most of the wealthy people out there are self-made. They worked hard to achieve their dreams. They are not racist. These people are well-travelled. They love other cultures and other people. Many of them have multi-racial and multicultural families. They are also not selfish. They take charity work very seriously. And not only give their money to causes, but also their blood, sweat and tears. I remember one young woman. She grew up a NY socialite from a very prominent family. Here she was in a small town, putting together party favors in 90 degree weather for hours while sick and in pain. She did it because she cared about children who had grown too old and aged out of the foster care system. Every month she would bring gift bags of toiletries to the homeless that she would put together despite her condition (her sickness was chronic). She isn't the exemption, either. She’s the rule. I have never seen people give as much, not just money but in time and hard work and sweat and tears, as I have seen the wealthy give. Never. 


How to network the way the wealthy and top people do:


As I said, I can't customize this to each person (I'd need to see you in action to do that) and I can't get too much into details of specific techniques because then this would end up the size of a few books instead of a post. I mean, this post is already long and I’ve only covered the prerequisites.

wealthy and top people don't network or socialize for business. They network and socialize to make friends. You have to realize that these people already have enough business. Instead, they are looking to make deals. But not deals with just anyone, deals with people they trust. Who are the people they trust the most? Their close friends. That’s why you see so many wealthy and powerful people doing business with their friends over and over again. It’s not because they won't let anyone else in. It’s because these are the people who took the time to nurture a friendship instead of trying to jump into business right away.


When you first meet someone don't talk business. Talk to make friends. Talk about your interests, hobbies. Find out what their interests and hobbies are. I became friends with one person by talking video games. We ended up playing Rock Band together. Later on, a couple years later he asked me to be on the board of one of his companies. 
Sometimes the slow way is the fastest way. When I was in grad school and we were near graduating a lot of my friends were worried about getting jobs and networking. I told them to network by making friends (how multimillionaires do it). They said they didn't have time for that and that they needed to find a job immediately. A year or two after graduation they had still not found a job they wanted  and I was hanging out with multimillionaires and getting offers that if I ever wanted to start a company they would invest in me. My classmates thought that making friends was too slow and had no purpose. They didn't have years to network. They were too busy for that. But with wealthy people across the country (and in Hollywood), business is done with friends. With people who took the time to foster true friendships over years.


Be genuine. I know I said this before. But I want to stress this. Your friendship has to be genuine. These people didn't get to where they are by being stupid. They’ll know if you are just trying to sweet talk them and pretend to be friends. A lukewarm genuine friendship is stronger than a warm fake friendship. They will know. And you will get a bad reputation.


As your friendship becomes stronger, it’ll just be natural to start talking business and projects. It’ll start by them asking you for advice on their projects. This is a sign that you can both start asking each other for advice (not for help). After this happens for a while it’ll naturally progress further. Again, it may seem slow at the beginning but in the long run, it’ll be the shorter route.


Always be a good friend, even if you don't need them anymore.
Word will spread if you were just friends with someone to get to their friends or contacts and, not only is this a horrible thing to do, but you will be blacklisted
Make friends with everyone. If you are just targeting the wealthy or powerful and ignoring people you think can't help you or are below you, not only will you miss out on an wonderful part of life, but people will find out that you do this and you will be blacklisted. 
Don't feel you have to chase every opportunity. Some people feel like they will lose it on their opportunity if they don't get that person’s contact info right away. So they try to get their info so that they can pitch them or suggest hanging out. People see through this and it's desperate. As you practice this method more and more and continually meet new people you will realize (or create) that there is an abundance of opportunity. Sometimes one of the best things to do is to just have a good talk and leave a good impression for next time. Don't trade contact info. When you next meet that person they will remember what an interesting person you were (and also give you points for not being desperate) and your chance of becoming friends goes up. I had a friend who ran the production company of an A-list actor. She and I kept running into each other at parties and talking about art. After a while I told her about a cool little place in Venice where writers get together and we made plans to go check it out. She is one of my closest friends and to this day I call her my big sister.


Do favors. Don't charge your friends. I did a lot of favors for my friends. I never charged them. I worked on their projects, I did consulting work for them. I never charged. They were my buddies. They didn't charge me either when they worked on my projects. I remember on day, sitting at a table on one of my projects with several of my friends who were helping me out. This wasn't a small project either and these people were seriously big. I remember sitting at the table as we were brainstorming and realizing that if I had to pay these people what they regularly make, I’d owe them several million dollars. Once you charge a friend for work you do for them, your relationship automatically goes from “friendship” to “business” and it's hard to re-earn that trust you lost. Now, that said, just because you shouldn't charge your friends for work you do, doesn't mean you guys can't partner up and make money together. And, in fact, this is what happens a lot: you’ll start to create projects together and do deals like this.


Never, ever, in any circumstance, ask to be introduced to your friend’s contacts. This will mark you as a “user” - someone who only created that friendship so that you can get to their contacts. You could be blacklisted by that person for doing this. This applies to powerful people, wealthy people and people in Hollywood: never ask for their contacts or for them to introduce you to one of their friends. I know this is common in traditional networking, but with the powerful and wealthy it's frowned upon. If they want to, they will take the initiative and introduce you to their friends or people they think could help you. I know one person who barely avoided being blacklisted from some very wealthy circles. A few people were convinced that he was only friends with one person because she had so many wealthy contacts. Had he ever mentioned or asked to meet someone they would have locked him out. Luckily, he was more trustworthy than that and he never did. Another person I know went behind the back of their friend to meet his friend’s contact. He was blacklisted not just from them, but from the whole community. Word spreads and new people avoided him. 
Cold calling people asking for help is sales. And just like sales, your chance for success are low (sales is a number game, after all). If you have to reach out cold, make it personal. Be nice. Be a friend. If I see an article I like, I will reach out to the author and email them that I loved their work and complement them. When you cold call someone and try to sell rather than trying to start a relationship, you get stereotyped as “business”. And, as we said previously, switching from “business” to “friend” is very hard to do.
That said, I have had people cold call me successfully and I have done the same. The people who contacted me cold that were the most successful were the ones who reached out as a friend and low key. But face to face is always the best way to meet someone and foster a friendship. 
Never treat these people anything other than regular people. Don't be a fan and gush about how amazing they are. Sure, it’s flattering, but they'll never be friends with you. They may, if you’re nice, meet up once or twice to mentor you, but you’ll never get invited into their homes nor will you ever be close friends with them. The constant flattery means you aren't familiar with these types of people and have no idea how to act around these people. You could also be a stalker or a user. This applies to the wealthy, the powerful and the famous. 


Questions and Answers

Q: Someone asked, “how do you find opportunities to meet significant types of people?” 

A: these type of opportunities are all around you. I met the publicist to one of the biggest rock bands in history at Barnes and Nobles. We talked about horror movies before deciding to hang out. When we did and I asked what she did, she told me about the band. I asked her what she liked about PR. I met one of the biggest entrepreneurs in the country getting my hair cut. No one ever recognizes him, nor would they unless they live in very wealthy circles. But yeah, friendliest guy ever. The thing is the wealthy and the powerful aren't some kind of mysterious species that live in some hidden ecosystem. These people go to the same places as you and me: Barnes and Nobles, Apple Store, the mall, Panera, Target. Not Walmart, though. As much as I love Walmart they’re never there. If you aren't finding these type of people or opportunities the problem isn't where you are, it’s that you aren't talking to people when you go places. One of the most useful skills I learned was how to just talk and make friends with anyone wherever I am. I’ve met all of my wealthy, powerful and famous friends like that. As well as my poor, not powerful and definitely not famous friends. 


Q: How do you get your foot in the door? What do rich and powerful people want to see from you?

A: this is traditional style networking type thinking. “What value are they looking for?”, “What can I offer them?”  When you are just making friends with people none of this matters. I've been to some of the most exclusive places. All because I just made friend with people. Friendship is valuable to everyone, whether you are rich, poor, powerful or a nobody. Now, there are specific techniques that the rich and powerful use to foster close friendships. There are phases to meeting, rules, etc. it’s too complex to get into here but I will cover them in the videos. Like I said, I'll update anyone who is interested through my email. 


Q: What's the trade-off between spending time and effort networking with powerful people versus networking with peers, some of whom might eventually become rich and powerful people?

A: this is a really great question. As I said earlier, you should be networking with everyone. Those above you, below you and your peers. You should be making friends with all of these people. They all offer advantages and you should never just focus on one or another. Network and socialize with all of them. 


Q: What are common mistakes?

A: There are a lot. Too many to cover in this small post. I covered some earlier in the post. I'll cover more in the videos. 


Q: How long did it take you to develop this skill (to various stages of development or comfort)? What was your starting point?

A: another great question. It took me over a decade to get to where I am today. I started making friends with people successfully after about a year to two years after I started practicing regularly. I'm better today than I was when I only did it for two years. You continually improve. It never stops. Everyone who knows me personally may find what I'm about to say funny, but I still consider myself a student. I am always learning. Always adding. My starting point was that I used to be a very introverted person who hated parties and never spoke to strangers. I liked hanging out with my close friends and in one-on-one settings. However, the beauty of this networking technique is that it works equally well for introverts as it does extroverts. My wife grew up a socialite. She thinks I'm lying whenever I tell her I used to be an introverted geek as do most of my new friends. I didn't have to do anything I felt was fake. In fact, I feel I'm being more genuine when I network like this. I will admit the first two years were brutal. A lot of trial and even more error. I made a lot of mistakes. It’s just like learning a new sport or becoming good at it: you have to miss a lot of shots and lose a lot of games. Oh, also, I'm not into sports or cars. Never was and I'm still not. Luckily, I didn't need to be when using this type of networking. If you like video games bond over that. Poetry? Then make friends with that. One my friends in Hollywood introduced me to and is friends with all the top people in the industry. He and I used to hang out and talk about ancient history. That’s what we liked. The only problem is if you are extroverted: you have to unlearn some things that may have become natural for you. It’s like you’ve been swinging wrong your whole life and have to learn a new way to swing. For introverts, you have to put in the effort. It’s hard work, but it's worth it. I’ve done some amazing things, gone amazing places, met amazing people and, most of all, met the most wonderful person in the world because of it: my wife. 


Q: I'd like to know how someone who is nervous of meeting new people and awful with small talk can network effectively.

A: I’ll cover this technique in the videos, but the gist of it is: bond over the things you both like. Discover if you guys have things in common and bond over those. Also, remember that as nervous as you are, there are people who are just as or more nervous than you.  Go help them out. I used to be like this: nervous of meeting new people and making small talk. I never knew what to talk about. Now I know how to captivate groups and it come second nature. Networking and socializing are fixed traits that you are born with (like height or eye color). They are skills that can be improved if you are willing to put in the hard work. If not, I can't help you. I remember one woman who ran a salon. She refused to learn how to do financials. I kept telling her how easy it was and how I used to hate it until I put in the effort. She still didn't want to and lost her business. In her mind it was a fixed trait that she could never change. So she never did. For me, I thought I could change it, and I did. 


I really hope this post helps a lot of you.
If you have any questions please feel free to reach out. And email me on your progress as well! I want to know how you guys are doing! Always love meeting new people. I'm retired now from consulting but I always love hearing from people.


Good luck everyone. I wish you all success.

Hey everyone, 

I'm thinking of creating a post about how I made my contacts in Hollywood. Basically how I learned to network the Hollywood way. I was lucky when I was in LA in that I met some really good people from the Industry. They taught me how to create relationships and network. Because of that I got to go to movie premeires, opening parties, parties in Hollywood Hills, hung out with top directors, producers, actors, models. I've been on lists to exclusive parties. 

I know a lot of people who move to LA and try to make it in the Industry (film, tv, fashion and music) have really bad experiences. Thought I might be able to help out. 

I need suggestions on what you would like me to cover. What questions you have, etc. Any help would be appreciated. 

Also, I later found out that this style of networking works really well with wealthy people as well (for some reason the top people in Hollywood network exactly like how rich and powerful people do across the rest of the US). So it'll help with meeting investors as well (whether they invest in your project or not is a different matter). 

Let me know what kinds of stuff you want me to cover. You can either PM me, comment here or just email me at rgabrielshih@gmail.com.

Edit: guys, just wanted to add: great stuff!  Thanks for adding! Please keep the suggestions coming.Hi everyone,

Here is a short guide on how some of the top people in Hollywood network and socialize. This is just from my experience. Sorry it took so long, I know some people were waiting for this. If you want to read more stuff on how the people in Hollywood network or how the rich and powerful network, check out my other posts. 

Why Networking is important:
A friend from Reddit had a great observation that a lot of people aren’t aware of the importance of networking. Basically, the “WHY?” of networking. ‘Why is it so important?’. So, for the past week, I’ve been thinking about how I can communicate this clearly (which is why this post is delayed - sorry). And this is what I’ve come up with: Opportunity is other people. Everything that happens, your script gets picked up, an agent wants to represent you, a celebrity wants to work on your movie, a producer wants to back you, investors want to invest, all of these opportunities depend on other people and the quality of your relationship with them. 

You can have all the talent in the world. You can work 80 hours a week. You could be the next big thing. But if you never get an opportunity, all that talent, hard work and potential is wasted. 

Most people have no idea how to find these opportunities. They think opportunities are random. They just sit there, waiting for opportunity to knock, thinking there’s nothing they can do about it. Other people go out to networking events, collect business cards, make calls and send out pitches. These people are basically shooting in the dark. They know they have to go out and find opportunity, but they don’t know how or where to find it. The difference between ‘traditional networking’ and ‘rich and powerful networking’ is the difference between ‘going out into the forest, hoping to find food’ and ‘building a farm’. The top people in Hollywood and multimillionaires grow and cultivate opportunities. They have an overabundance of opportunities. They never have to go out and ‘hunt’ for it. 

I’ve met so many talented and hard working people in Los Angeles and across the country. But most of these people never get a chance, they never get their opportunity. I see them years, even decades, later still doing the same thing they did before, no progress whatsoever, still waiting for their big break, for someone to notice them.  

This is what networking like the rich and the powerful is: it’s building a garden of opportunities. Planting those seeds so that when you need it, you won’t have to depend on chance. 


First, a little about me: 
I used to work in the corporate world. I predicted the dot.com crash back in college so my first job out of undergrad was for two VPs at a multibillion dollar international company. I was two levels away from the CEO. Went on to work for a few other multibillion dollar divisions then moved to Los Angeles to help family. Decided to take a break, made some friends with people in the industry and started helping them with their projects (pro bono consulting). No one big at this time. Word spread and I started meeting new people and making new friends. Some of my new friends were very connected in the industry. I started learning from them a different style of networking and socializing. As I started to meet more and more powerful people in Hollywood I noticed that the “higher up” I went the more people were using this style (as opposed to the people lower down who were using the old style). Later, I had the chance to earn my MBA in a year with a full scholarship so I moved to Boston. That’s when I noticed that angel investors, VCs and, in general, wealthy people used the same style of networking and socializing that Hollywood did. Across the country and in general, I’ve noticed that the people who were wealthier and more powerful tend to use this system. It’s helped me, not just professionally but personally as well. I’ve taught it to others (I was a business consultant, some business owners needed help networking) and it’s helped them professionally and personally as well. 

Typically, I teach this to people in person. I take them out to events like Hollywood parties or fashion shows or mingling events with wealthy people and I work with them one on one in person. Because of this I'm able to customize how they learn. This is usually over a period of months. I can't do that here so instead what I'll do is give some general tips on how Hollywood and rich people network as well as some specific info to Hollywood. 

Before we get into how to network and socialize like the top people do, there are some foundational things I want to set up. 

First thing I want to say is that this is not some magic technique, trick or social hack to persuade people to get your way. This a method of networking and socializing that took the wealthy and the powerful decades to figure out. The sad truth is that networking and socializing is just as complex as leadership and strategy. We devote courses and majors to those subjects but the most networking gets is maybe a book here or there or just an article that says the same old advice that is really sales, not networking. What you are doing is just learning from people who have spent decades figuring this out my trial and error and who, by pure luck, made the right choices while they were learning it. 
Networking and socializing does not replace hard work and dedication. I said earlier how talent and hardwork is wasted if there is never any opportunity to use it. At the same time, without talent and hard work, you’ll never do anything with those opportunities. Networking and socializing like the rich and like how the top people in LA do it will just give you the same opportunities that they get. However, whether you take advantage of those opportunities and what you do with them is up to you. 
Very important: never use people. Never be mean. Never be a jerk. I’ve actually seen a lot of people be jerks, divas and stab people in the back. And I've seen them get an early headstart because of it. However, I never met anyone at the top who was like this. Why? You can only get to a certain level working by yourself. There’s a point where you need to work with others in order to break through to the next level. Hollywood is all based on relationships. If you screwed over people to further your career quickly by the time you reach this wall you will have a reputation for being untrustworthy. You will never go past the mid to upper mid level of your career. I remember there was one guy who was a jerk to everyone. He would just pass it off as saying that’s how the industry was. He was infamous. You could mention his name at a party and everyone would roll their eyes and share their horror stories about the guy. After a while only one director would work with him. And this director was famous for b-level movies. Before this guy passed away he lived in a small one bedroom in Marina Del Rey. Saddest thing I ever saw. But he had dug his own hole. 
Don't just be nice to people above you, be nice to everyone. People below you, on your same level. Waiters, busboys, etc. This isn't just good manners but it helps you out as well. You don't want to piss off someone who you think is nothing only to find out that they have powerful contacts. In traditional networking most people have one type of “target” that is the person with power who everyone is trying to network with. And then you have gatekeepers. This is how beginning networkers see it. In Hollywood, there are actually two type of people with power: 1) the names: these are famous people. People that you have heard of. Or people with big titles. Most traditional or beginning networkers make the mistake of honking these are the only people they want to network with. 2) influencers: these guys have a lot of power with a lot of people, they aren't well known outside of their circles. But, most times these guys are the ones with the real power. These are the guys that “the names” worship whether they think they are cool or whatever. One of the most powerful people in Hollywood is a skater who works fashion. He’s friends with half of Hollywood. They love him because they think he’s cool. He’s their celebrity. But almost none of you would know his name. But he can call the private cell of almost any celeb in town. And a bad word from him could kill your career. So, like I said, be nice to everyone. If not for others than for yourself. 
As you socialize with more and more people at higher levels it becomes your RESPONSIBILITY to protect their privacy. It is basically your job to be a gatekeeper for them and vet anyone you introduce to them. It goes both ways: they will do the same for you. For instance, as I started meeting higher up people in LA and bringing some of my friends to exclusive parties they would tell some of their friends about the people I knew and was hanging out with. I would then get random head shots, scripts and pitches sent to my email. I had to ask my friends to stop talking about me or who I knew. As for the people who pitched me out of nowhere, I blocked them. Their approach was completely wrong as I'll explain later. Don't name the names of your friends and don't give away their contact info. Respect their privacy otherwise they will cut you out. 
There are always going to be jerks and users out there. I had to stop hanging out on the Westside (Marina, Venice and Santa Monica) because when people found out who I knew they would stalk me. There are more than enough opportunities out there. There is never a good reason to be desperate enough that you have to put up with anyone being mean to you or a jerk. Most times, it's because they're stuck in their careers. The top people in the industry (and the wealthiest across the country) are some of the nicest people I ever met. 

How to network the way the wealthy and top people do:
As I said, I can't customize this to each person (I'd need to see you in action to do that) and I can't get too much into details of specific techniques because then this would end up the size of a few books instead of a post. I mean, this post is already long and I’ve only covered the prerequisites. 

wealthy and top people don't network or socialize for business they do it to make friends. You have to realize that these people already have enough business. Instead, they are looking to make deals. But not deals with just anyone, deals with people they trust. Who are the people they trust the most? Their close friends. That’s why you see so many wealthy and powerful people doing business with their friends over and over again. It’s not because they won't let anyone else in. It’s because these are the people who took the time to nurture a friendship instead of trying to jump into business right away. 
When you first meet someone don't talk business. Talk to make friends. Talk about your interests, hobbies. Find out what their interests and hobbies are. I became friends with one person by talking video games. We ended up playing online together (Call of Duty). He was me of the VPs at the studios. Another woman and I used to hang out at bookstores and art museums. We weren't dating, we were just hanging out as friends. She was the president of the production company of a A-list actor. 
Sometimes the slow way is the fastest way. When I first came to LA there were a lot of people who wouldn't give me the time of day because they were further than me in the industry. I was new to LA and the Industry. They would always go to networking events, make calls and try in vain to set up a meeting to pitch to some of the biggest people. I was just out to make friends. Two years later and now I was the one they were trying to pitch to. They thought that making friends was too slow and had no purpose. They didn't have years to network. They were too busy for that. But in Hollywood and with wealthy people across the country, business is done with friends. With people who took the time to foster true friendships over years. 
Be genuine. I know I said this before. But I want to stress this. Your friendship has to be genuine. These people didn't get to where they are by being stupid. They’ll know if you are just trying to sweet talk them and pretend to be friends. A lukewarm genuine friendship is stronger than a warm fake friendship. They will know. And you will get a bad reputation. 
As your friendship becomes stronger, it’ll just be natural to start talking business and projects. It’ll start by them asking you for advice on their projects. This is a sign that you can both start asking each other for advice (not for help). After this happens for a while it’ll naturally progress further. Again, it may seem slow at the beginning but in the long run, it’ll be the shorter route. 
Always be a good friend, even if you don't need them anymore. 
Where to meet people. LA has this weird thing where they throw networking events that cost money to attend. They advertise that you will meet people from the studios. You will, but it's a guy from the mailroom. These are all rip offs. The real industry parties have the following characteristics: 1. Free to attend, 2. Only requirement to attend is you have to be on the list 3. People and celebrities from all industries will be at the party. The real parties are all like a mixing pot of film, tv, fashion and music industries. I remember going to The Aviator premiere and meeting a very famous rock star. Funny guy. Met in the bathroom at Graumann’s Chinese. He was telling me a funny story about how he was almost late, jumped out of bed and grabbed his pants only to find out now that he was wearing his girlfriend’s pants. 
Don't feel you have to chase every opportunity. Some people feel like they will lose it on their opportunity if they don't get that person’s contact info right away. So they try to get their info so that they can pitch them or suggest hanging out. People see through this and, most likely will give the number of their assistant or agent which is a nice way of blowing you off. If they want to hang out they will put you in their cell. If they don't put you in their cell don't call attention to it, just say thank you nicely and learn your lesson for next time. Sometimes one of the best things to do is to just have a good talk and leave a good impression for next time. Don't trade contact info. When you next meet that person they will remember what an interesting person you were (and also give you points for not being desperate) and your chance of becoming friends goes up. My friend who had run the production company? She and I kept running into each other at parties and talking about art. After a while I told her about a cool little place in Venice where writers get together and we made plans to go check it out. She is one of my closest friends and to this day I call her my big sister. 
Do favors. Don't charge your friends. I did a lot of favors for my friends. I never charged them. I worked on their projects, I did consulting work for them. I never charged. They were my buddies. They didn't charge me either when they worked on my projects. I remember on day, sitting at a table on one of my projects with several of my friends who were helping me out. This wasn't a small project either and these people were seriously big. I remember sitting at the table as we were brainstorming and realizing that if I had to pay these people what they regularly make, I’d owe them several million dollars. Once you charge a friend for work you do for them, your relationship automatically goes from “friendship” to “business” and it's hard to re-earn that trust you lost. Now, that said, just because you shouldn't charge your friends for work you do, doesn't mean you guys can't partner up and make money together. And, in fact, this is what happens a lot: you’ll start to create projects together and do deals like this. 
Never, ever, in any circumstance, asked one introduced to one of your new friend’s contacts. This will mark you as a “user” - someone who only created that friendship so that you can get to their contacts. You could be blacklisted by that person for doing this. This applies to powerful people and wealthy people: never ask for their contacts or for them to introduce you to one of their friends. I know this is common in traditional networking, but with the powerful and wealthy it's frowned upon. If they want to, they will take the initiative and introduce you to their friends or people they think could help you. I know one person who barely avoided being blacklisted from some very wealthy circles. A few people were convinced that he was only friends with one person because she had so many wealthy contacts. Had he ever mentioned or asked to meet someone they would have locked him out. Luckily, he was more trustworthy than that and he never did. She ended up introducing him to people once she trusted him.
Cold calling people asking for help is sales. And just like sales, your chance for success are low (sales is a number game, after all). If you have to reach out cold, make it personal. Be nice. Be a friend. If I see an article I like, I will reach out to the author and email them that I loved their work and complement them. When you cold call someone and try to sell rather than trying to start a relationship, you get stereotyped as “business”. And, as we said previously, switching from “business” to “friend” is very hard to do. 
Never treat these people anything other than regular people. Don't be a fan and gush about how amazing they are. Sure, it’s flattering, but they'll never be friends with you. They may, if you’re nice, meet up once or twice to mentor you, but you’ll never get invited into their homes nor will you ever be close friends with them. The constant flattery means you aren't familiar with these types of people and have no idea how to act around these people. You could also be a stalker or a user. This applies to the wealthy, the powerful and the famous. 


Questions and answers
Q: One person asked “how do you know when you are good enough to talk to top people?”  
A: You are already good enough to talk to top people. And you are more than good enough to be friends with them. I’m assuming, of course that you are a good person who cares for other people and not a con artist. Now, are you good enough to work with them? That’s for them to decide. But, even if you aren't, they are still going to help you out if you are good friends. 


Q: someone asked about meeting people at film markets and festivals. 
A: I’ve only been to the AFMs in Santa Monica every September. My friends have been to Sundance, Cannes and the Hong Kong film market. Their experience is like mine with AFM: most of the friendships are made at bars, clubs by the pool, after business is over and done. I've seen people attend, who don't even go to these things for the meetings: they’re just there to hang out at the after hours stuff and make friends that way. Again, making friends is THE most powerful way to network. A lot of people hear the saying “It’s not what you know but who you know”. The problem is that most people don't really understand what that means. It’s not just who you know, it's also how close you are to them. That’s why the most powerful people spend years cultivating friendships. 

Q: Someone asked about talent. 
A: As my father progressed through his career he eventually got very high up in the corporate world. He was once telling me a story about two guys who were being considered for a VP position at a Fortune 100 company (that my dad worked at). He told me they made their decision to go with the guy who was a friend of theirs. I said that that was unfair: shouldn't the most qualified and skilled person get the job? That seemed more fair than just giving it to the guy who had more friends. Without missing a beat my dad told me: “Once you reach a certain level EVERYONE is qualified and skilled otherwise they wouldn't be there”.  This is true of every industry. Once you reach a certain level, whether it's Hollywood or as an Entrepreneur, everyone is qualified. After that it’s all about your social skills. Some people call it “politics”. But that's just another word for relationships. Like I said earlier, once you reach a certain level you need to be able to be a team player, to inspire people and to be able to forge strong bonds. Sadly, that’s not as common a skill as people like to believe. 

Q: Someone asked about my go to icebreakers and stories to talk to other people at parties. 
A: I don't have any. I listen and I observe. If the person is talking about something I am interested in I will join in the conversation. Don't used canned material. If you use canned material you only get back canned answers that don't build any bonds. Observe them, what are they doing, what are they wearing? Maybe this can be a way to open a conversation. During the conversation, listen to what they say to find more. There are actual techniques on how to discover more stuff, the phases of a conversation and what to do when, how to build multiple streams of interest and tips for sticking out. It’s too long to go through here. I’ll do some videos about those. Like I said, if you want me to update you when I do them email me (rgabrielshih@gmail.com). 

Q: Someone asked about following up after the initial meeting. 
A: I’ll cover this in the videos. There’s a technique to doing this. You basically treat each meet up as a mini-event. Again: there are phases. 

Q: Someone asked about how Hollywood feels about documentaries. 
A: I gotta say, I’ve met a lot of people with documentaries. Some very good ones. There really is no market in Hollywood for them. There are festivals that celebrate them. But for every “Fast Food Nation” or that penguin documentary there are thousands of docs that go unseen. If you are looking to do a doc. My advice is to use these same techniques to make friends with rich people. A lot of wealthy people love to give to causes. Make it easy for them: non-profit 501c3. But only speak with the ones that are your good friends. If they believe in you and they love the project they will network with other wealthy people for you. I am also doing a post like this on r/startups and r/entrepreneur that focuses more on networking and socializing with wealthy people (versus Hollywood). If you want to see those contact me and I'll send you the links. It’s very similar to how to network in Hollywood but there are key differences that you have to understand. 

I really hope this post helps a lot of you. 
If you have any questions please feel free to reach out. And email me on your progress as well! I want to know how you guys are doing! Always love meeting new people. I'm retired now from consulting but I always love hearing from people. 

Good luck everyone. Break a leg and make me proud. I wish you all success.

This was actually from an email talking about a research tool. But I found what he wrote to be pretty true of any investor. I've seen investors offer to invest in people who have no ideas, they just believe in the person. And I've seen them pass up business offers because they don't believe in the person. 

As I've said earlier, I've found that one of the most important skills I ever learned was how to create close and true friendships with all types of people. 


Robert Kiyosaki:
""When I travel, speaking around the world, people come up to me often and say, “I have a great idea that will make me rich. Can I share it with you?” What these people are really asking is if I’m willing to invest in their idea. While I politely listen to these ideas, I never invest in them.

This is because I don’t invest in ideas. I invest in businesses. And I don’t invest with inventors. I invest with entrepreneurs. Anyone can have a great idea, but only a great entrepreneur can make money with that idea.

It’s not enough to have the proverbial light bulb over your head. You must see how that light bulb can benefit lots of people, know how to sell those benefits in a winsome way, and understand how to build a business that can deliver those benefits in a way that makes a profit. Sounds simple enough, but it takes continual learning and practice.""Hey everyone,

I'm posting in here and in r/Entrepreneur.
I'm thinking of doing a post on how rich and powerful people network and socialize and end up doing business together. I learned how to network like this from some high up people in Hollywood and from multimillionaires across the country. It's helped me a lot and I thought it might help others as well. 

I need suggestions on what you would like me to cover. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Just to clarify, this type of networking isn't used to get new clients (sales). It's more gears towards collaborating and making deals with wealthy and/or powerful people. It focuses on creating relationships with them to lead to these opportunities. 

You don't have to be rich or powerful to use this technique or to benefit from it. I learned it and I taught other people how to do it. 

Let me know what kinds of things would you like me to cover in my post. What problems are you having with networking or socializing? What stuff can I cover that would make my post more helpful to people. 

Any advice would be sincerely appreciated. 
PM me, comment here or email me at rgabrielshih@gmail.com. 

Thanks for any advice!

Edit: Everyone, I just wanted to add: great suggestions! Thank you so much for adding them! Please keep them coming!I think Swift Playgrounds if for iPad only, correct?

Anything like that on the Mac? That makes learning programming easy and that could translate to an actual app/Xcode?

Or maybe there is a program like that in Xcode?

Thanks.Hi everyone, I wanted to make a post on how wealthy and powerful people socialize and some tips that might help you. It's a bit long so I apologize in advance. 

I made longer posts about this in r/filmmakers that focuses on that industry and Hollywood (here: https://m.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/4rexw9/my_guide_on_how_to_network_in_hollywood_sorry_its/)

I did another one that focused on more entrepreneur needs in r/Entrepreneurs (here: https://m.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4reznu/a_guide_on_how_to_network_like_the_rich_and/)

Feel free to check out either one out if any of that pertains to you. 

I do want to do one specifically for people who struggle socially. I've taught this technique to people who were very socially awkward (some were tech guys, others had social anxiety) and they've been very successful with it. I myself was very introverted before someone taught me these techniques. Please note that I am not a therapist, this is just a few tips that have worked for me and a few of my friends. 

First of all, why would this help? 
Multimillionaires and powerful people use a strange hybrid of networking and socializing that is built to optimize not only business opportunities but also personal ones as well. Many people have used this to find their significant other, to make close friends with all types of people across the world and to experience things that they never would have otherwise. 

How did I learn this?
You can read the other posts and it tells my story. To sum it up, I became friends with powerful people in Hollywood and then with multimillionaires. I studied how they networked and was taught by other friends. Using their techniques I went from a stay-at-home introvert to having gone to movie premieres, country clubs and having friends across the planet. 

Tips
1. The rich and powerful focus on friendships first and foremost. They don't network to do business. They network to make friends. They are very good at making close friends. Their secret to this? Good conversation. 


2. What makes good conversation? What confuses most people is that they think deep or talkative communication is good conversation. It isn't. Good conversation is bonding over shared interests. If you like Pokemon GO, for instance (just because everyone is talking about it) and the other person likes it, then that starts a bonding moment. Try to find several of these. For instance, if someone is into Ridley Scott, there's a good chance they may love other directors similar to Scott or other works similar to his work. 

3. If you are shy and stumble for words. Talking about your interests helps with this. Especially shared interests. I've seen people who never talk all of a sudden not be able to stop when they talk about something they love. The secret is to segway into something you both love. 


4. If you have trouble approaching people. Find people who are shy as well: people who are on their own. Have the mindset of a host: approach them and try to make them feel comfortable and get them talking. 
Focus on making sure they have a good time. 

5. Approaching people part 2: later on you can try approaching other groups. There are many techniques and ways to do this. But, for now practice with the easiest one: look for a group that is big enough and talking about something public. Don't go after a group that seems to be talking about something serious or personal.  There are two types of groups: open/public and closed/personal. Find an open one and then just stand by them and smile and listen. Do this at first until you can do it comfortable and people start to let you in by moving aside regularly. When that happens, study the rhythm of the conversation. A conversation rises and falls like a breeze. When it starts to slow down, interject an on-topic open-ended question to the last person who was speaking and then stay quiet. Keep having a friendly and non-threatening demeanor by smiling and using relaxed body language. Keep practicing this until your questions ""re-spur"" the conversation. 

6. Practice, practice, practice. If you are shy, the idea of talking to strangers can be frightening. Practicing can help you overcome this. Start off with baby steps at first. Next time you are at a store, you can tell the cashier that they have a cool watch, or you like their shirt. A simple “Nice necklace” is good enough. You can even do this with people you are walking by. The more you do this the easier it becomes to talk to more people. Later on, you can do a sentence or two follow up. 

I'm going to stop here because it's already a bit long. If you want to read more check out the stuff I wrote on the other subreddits. 

I am going to do a series of videos on this stuff. The first series will just focus on how to starts conversation, what the stages are and how to keep in touch. It's more geared towards networking but the info may be helpful to anyone who’s looking to improve their social skills. If you want me to update you when they come out feel free to send me a personal email at rgabrielshih@gmail.com. 

Like I said in my other subreddit posts, not sure what form the video classes will take, but they'll be free to everyone from Reddit. You guys have all been awesome to me. I love the Reddit community and this is my way of giving back. 

Hey, I hope these tips work out for you guys! Keep trying and don't give up! I've seen it work for people! If a shy, nerdy introvert like me can end up marrying a beautiful NY socialite then anyone can learn how to do this! If you have any other tips for the people here, please feel free to share them in the comments below! 
Hi everyone, 

As promised, here is a short guide on how multimillionaires and powerful people use a different type of networking to create opportunities and how use can use that same style to create opportunities for yourself. Sorry it took so long, I know some people were waiting for this. If you want to read more stuff on how the people in Hollywood network or how the rich and powerful network, check out my other posts.

Why Networking is so Important:
A friend from Reddit had a great observation that a lot of people aren’t aware of the importance of networking. Basically, the “WHY?” of networking. ‘Why is it so important?’. So, for the past week, I’ve been thinking about how I can communicate this clearly (which is why this post is delayed - sorry). And this is what I’ve come up with: Opportunity always comes from other people. Everything that happens to you as an entrepreneur, you get a huge deal, you find mentors, you meet investors, VCs, a huge joint venture, all of these opportunities depend on other people and quality of your relationship with them.

You can have all the skill in the world. You can work 80 hours a week. Your company could be the next big thing. But if you never get an opportunity, all that talent, hard work and potential is wasted. 

Most people have no idea how to find these opportunities. They think opportunities are random. They just sit there, waiting for opportunity to knock, thinking there’s nothing they can do about it. That all they have to do is to focus on their company or product and opportunity will find them. Other people go out to networking events, collect business cards, make calls and try to set up meetings. These people are basically shooting in the dark. They know they have to go out and find opportunity, but they don’t know how or where to find it. The difference between ‘traditional networking’ and ‘rich and powerful networking’ is the difference between ‘going out into the forest, hoping to find food’ and ‘building a farm’. The rich and powerful grow and cultivate opportunities. They have an overabundance of opportunities. They never have to go out and ‘hunt’ for it. 

I’ve met so many talented and hard-working entrepreneurs across the country. All of them with amazing ideas and companies. But most of these people never get a chance, they never get their opportunity. I see them years, even decades, later still doing the same thing they did before, no progress whatsoever, still waiting for their big break, for their big opportunity. 

This is what networking like the rich and the powerful is: it’s building a garden of opportunities. Planting those seeds so that when you need it, you won’t have to depend on chance. 

First, a little about me: 
I used to work in the corporate world. I predicted the dot.com crash back in college so my first job out of undergrad was for two VPs at a multibillion dollar international company. I was two levels away from the CEO. Went on to work for a few other multibillion dollar divisions then moved to Los Angeles to help family. 

Decided to take a break, made some friends with people in the industry and started helping them with their projects (pro bono consulting). No one big at this time. Word spread and I started meeting new people and making new friends. Some of my new friends were very connected in the industry. I started learning from them a different style of networking and socializing. As I started to meet more and more powerful people in Hollywood I noticed that the “higher up” I went the more people were using this style (as opposed to the people lower down who were using the traditional style of networking that we are all taught). 

Later, I had the chance to earn my MBA in a year with a full scholarship so I moved to Boston. That’s when I started making friends with angel investors, VCs and, in general, wealthy people and noticed that they used the same style of networking and socializing that Hollywood did. In general, I’ve noticed that the people who were wealthier and more powerful tend to use this system. 

For most people, this style of networking and socializing is learned over decades of trial and error. Which is why it’s primarily used by the rich and the powerful: they were the ones who put decades of practiceinto it. The other types of people who know this type of socializing and networking are the children who were born into these families. I've known children of the very wealthy and very powerful across the country who are very good at this (there are exceptions, though, as you can gather from the news). 

It’s helped me, not just professionally but personally as well (it's the reason I met most of my friends and, most importantly, my wife). I’ve taught it to others (I was a business consultant, some business owners needed help networking and socializing) and it’s helped them professionally and personally as well.


Typically, I teach this to people in-person. I take them out to events like Hollywood parties or fashion shows or mingling events with wealthy people and I work with them face-to-face. Because of this I'm able to customize how they learn. This is usually over a period of months. I can't do that here so instead what I'll do is give some general tips on how wealthy and powerful people network as well as some specific info on wealthy people. 

Before we get into how to network and socialize like the top people do, there are some foundational things I want to set up.


First thing I want to say is that this is not some magic technique, trick or social hack to persuade people to get your way. This a method of networking and socializing that took the wealthy and the powerful decades to figure out. The sad truth is that networking and socializing is just as complex as leadership and strategy. We devote courses and majors to those subjects but the most networking gets is maybe a book here or there or just an article that says the same old advice that is really sales, not networking. The stuff I'm showing you here is the same stuff that typically takes people decades of trial and error to figure out. I was just lucky to learn it early. 
Networking and socializing does not replace hard work and dedication. I said earlier how talent and hardwork is wasted if there is never any opportunity to use it. At the same time, without talent and hard work, you’ll never do anything with those opportunities. Networking and socializing like the rich and like how the top people in LA do it will just give you the same opportunities that they get. However, whether you take advantage of those opportunities and what you do with them is up to you. 
Very important: never use people. Never try to con people or try to get their money. I’ve seen some people use unsavory tactics to get ahead in life. And they do get an early headstart because of it. However, I never met anyone at the top who was like this. Why? You can only get to a certain level working by yourself. There’s a point where you need to work with others in order to break through to the next level. And if you’ve been using people or conning them, then by the time you reach that level you will have built up a bad reputation that will keep you from the top levels. The wealthy and the powerful are smart. They didn't get to where they are by being poor judges of character. And the thing they value most of all is personal trust. Violate that and you will lose everything. I’ve seen people who were at the top of their game lose everything because they did something untrustworthy or stabbed someone in the back. 
As you socialize with more and more people at higher levels it becomes your RESPONSIBILITY to protect their privacy. It is basically your job to be a gatekeeper for them and vet anyone you introduce to them. It goes both ways: they will do the same for you. For instance, as I started meeting higher up people in LA and bringing some of my friends to exclusive parties they would tell some of their friends about the people I knew and was hanging out with. I would then get random head shots, scripts and pitches sent to my email. I had to ask my friends to stop talking about me or who I knew. As for the people who pitched me out of nowhere, I blocked them. Their approach was completely wrong as I'll explain later. Don't name the names of your friends and don't give away their contact info. Respect their privacy. 
Don't believe in the stereotypes of the wealthy. Most depictions of wealthy people are that they are racist, selfish, snobby and that their children are lazy and only want to party. None of this is true. The only people who believe this are people who never met a multimillionaire or multibillionaire in their life. Most of the wealthy people out there are self-made. They worked hard to achieve their dreams. They are not racist. These people are well-travelled. They love other cultures and other people. Many of them have multi-racial and multicultural families. They are also not selfish. They take charity work very seriously. And not only give their money to causes, but also their blood, sweat and tears. I remember one young woman. She grew up a NY socialite from a very prominent family. Here she was in a small town, putting together party favors in 90 degree weather for hours while sick and in pain. She did it because she cared about children who had grown too old and aged out of the foster care system. Every month she would bring gift bags of toiletries to the homeless that she would put together despite her condition (her sickness was chronic). She isn't the exemption, either. She’s the rule. I have never seen people give as much, not just money but in time and hard work and sweat and tears, as I have seen the wealthy give. Never. 


How to network the way the wealthy and top people do:


As I said, I can't customize this to each person (I'd need to see you in action to do that) and I can't get too much into details of specific techniques because then this would end up the size of a few books instead of a post. I mean, this post is already long and I’ve only covered the prerequisites.

wealthy and top people don't network or socialize for business. They network and socialize to make friends. You have to realize that these people already have enough business. Instead, they are looking to make deals. But not deals with just anyone, deals with people they trust. Who are the people they trust the most? Their close friends. That’s why you see so many wealthy and powerful people doing business with their friends over and over again. It’s not because they won't let anyone else in. It’s because these are the people who took the time to nurture a friendship instead of trying to jump into business right away.


When you first meet someone don't talk business. Talk to make friends. Talk about your interests, hobbies. Find out what their interests and hobbies are. I became friends with one person by talking video games. We ended up playing Rock Band together. Later on, a couple years later he asked me to be on the board of one of his companies. 
Sometimes the slow way is the fastest way. When I was in grad school and we were near graduating a lot of my friends were worried about getting jobs and networking. I told them to network by making friends (how multimillionaires do it). They said they didn't have time for that and that they needed to find a job immediately. A year or two after graduation they had still not found a job they wanted  and I was hanging out with multimillionaires and getting offers that if I ever wanted to start a company they would invest in me. My classmates thought that making friends was too slow and had no purpose. They didn't have years to network. They were too busy for that. But with wealthy people across the country (and in Hollywood), business is done with friends. With people who took the time to foster true friendships over years.


Be genuine. I know I said this before. But I want to stress this. Your friendship has to be genuine. These people didn't get to where they are by being stupid. They’ll know if you are just trying to sweet talk them and pretend to be friends. A lukewarm genuine friendship is stronger than a warm fake friendship. They will know. And you will get a bad reputation.


As your friendship becomes stronger, it’ll just be natural to start talking business and projects. It’ll start by them asking you for advice on their projects. This is a sign that you can both start asking each other for advice (not for help). After this happens for a while it’ll naturally progress further. Again, it may seem slow at the beginning but in the long run, it’ll be the shorter route.


Always be a good friend, even if you don't need them anymore.
Word will spread if you were just friends with someone to get to their friends or contacts and, not only is this a horrible thing to do, but you will be blacklisted
Make friends with everyone. If you are just targeting the wealthy or powerful and ignoring people you think can't help you or are below you, not only will you miss out on an wonderful part of life, but people will find out that you do this and you will be blacklisted. 
Don't feel you have to chase every opportunity. Some people feel like they will lose it on their opportunity if they don't get that person’s contact info right away. So they try to get their info so that they can pitch them or suggest hanging out. People see through this and it's desperate. As you practice this method more and more and continually meet new people you will realize (or create) that there is an abundance of opportunity. Sometimes one of the best things to do is to just have a good talk and leave a good impression for next time. Don't trade contact info. When you next meet that person they will remember what an interesting person you were (and also give you points for not being desperate) and your chance of becoming friends goes up. I had a friend who ran the production company of an A-list actor. She and I kept running into each other at parties and talking about art. After a while I told her about a cool little place in Venice where writers get together and we made plans to go check it out. She is one of my closest friends and to this day I call her my big sister.


Do favors. Don't charge your friends. I did a lot of favors for my friends. I never charged them. I worked on their projects, I did consulting work for them. I never charged. They were my buddies. They didn't charge me either when they worked on my projects. I remember on day, sitting at a table on one of my projects with several of my friends who were helping me out. This wasn't a small project either and these people were seriously big. I remember sitting at the table as we were brainstorming and realizing that if I had to pay these people what they regularly make, I’d owe them several million dollars. Once you charge a friend for work you do for them, your relationship automatically goes from “friendship” to “business” and it's hard to re-earn that trust you lost. Now, that said, just because you shouldn't charge your friends for work you do, doesn't mean you guys can't partner up and make money together. And, in fact, this is what happens a lot: you’ll start to create projects together and do deals like this.


Never, ever, in any circumstance, ask to be introduced to your friend’s contacts. This will mark you as a “user” - someone who only created that friendship so that you can get to their contacts. You could be blacklisted by that person for doing this. This applies to powerful people, wealthy people and people in Hollywood: never ask for their contacts or for them to introduce you to one of their friends. I know this is common in traditional networking, but with the powerful and wealthy it's frowned upon. If they want to, they will take the initiative and introduce you to their friends or people they think could help you. I know one person who barely avoided being blacklisted from some very wealthy circles. A few people were convinced that he was only friends with one person because she had so many wealthy contacts. Had he ever mentioned or asked to meet someone they would have locked him out. Luckily, he was more trustworthy than that and he never did. Another person I know went behind the back of their friend to meet his friend’s contact. He was blacklisted not just from them, but from the whole community. Word spreads and new people avoided him. 
Cold calling people asking for help is sales. And just like sales, your chance for success are low (sales is a number game, after all). If you have to reach out cold, make it personal. Be nice. Be a friend. If I see an article I like, I will reach out to the author and email them that I loved their work and complement them. When you cold call someone and try to sell rather than trying to start a relationship, you get stereotyped as “business”. And, as we said previously, switching from “business” to “friend” is very hard to do.
That said, I have had people cold call me successfully and I have done the same. The people who contacted me cold that were the most successful were the ones who reached out as a friend and low key. But face to face is always the best way to meet someone and foster a friendship. 
Never treat these people anything other than regular people. Don't be a fan and gush about how amazing they are. Sure, it’s flattering, but they'll never be friends with you. They may, if you’re nice, meet up once or twice to mentor you, but you’ll never get invited into their homes nor will you ever be close friends with them. The constant flattery means you aren't familiar with these types of people and have no idea how to act around these people. You could also be a stalker or a user. This applies to the wealthy, the powerful and the famous. 


Questions and Answers

Q: Someone asked, “how do you find opportunities to meet significant types of people?” 

A: these type of opportunities are all around you. I met the publicist to one of the biggest rock bands in history at Barnes and Nobles. We talked about horror movies before deciding to hang out. When we did and I asked what she did, she told me about the band. I asked her what she liked about PR. I met one of the biggest entrepreneurs in the country getting my hair cut. No one ever recognizes him, nor would they unless they live in very wealthy circles. But yeah, friendliest guy ever. The thing is the wealthy and the powerful aren't some kind of mysterious species that live in some hidden ecosystem. These people go to the same places as you and me: Barnes and Nobles, Apple Store, the mall, Panera, Target. Not Walmart, though. As much as I love Walmart they’re never there. If you aren't finding these type of people or opportunities the problem isn't where you are, it’s that you aren't talking to people when you go places. One of the most useful skills I learned was how to just talk and make friends with anyone wherever I am. I’ve met all of my wealthy, powerful and famous friends like that. As well as my poor, not powerful and definitely not famous friends. 


Q: How do you get your foot in the door? What do rich and powerful people want to see from you?

A: this is traditional style networking type thinking. “What value are they looking for?”, “What can I offer them?”  When you are just making friends with people none of this matters. I've been to some of the most exclusive places. All because I just made friend with people. Friendship is valuable to everyone, whether you are rich, poor, powerful or a nobody. Now, there are specific techniques that the rich and powerful use to foster close friendships. There are phases to meeting, rules, etc. it’s too complex to get into here but I will cover them in the videos. Like I said, I'll update anyone who is interested through my email. 


Q: What's the trade-off between spending time and effort networking with powerful people versus networking with peers, some of whom might eventually become rich and powerful people?

A: this is a really great question. As I said earlier, you should be networking with everyone. Those above you, below you and your peers. You should be making friends with all of these people. They all offer advantages and you should never just focus on one or another. Network and socialize with all of them. 


Q: What are common mistakes?

A: There are a lot. Too many to cover in this small post. I covered some earlier in the post. I'll cover more in the videos. 


Q: How long did it take you to develop this skill (to various stages of development or comfort)? What was your starting point?

A: another great question. It took me over a decade to get to where I am today. I started making friends with people successfully after about a year to two years after I started practicing regularly. I'm better today than I was when I only did it for two years. You continually improve. It never stops. Everyone who knows me personally may find what I'm about to say funny, but I still consider myself a student. I am always learning. Always adding. My starting point was that I used to be a very introverted person who hated parties and never spoke to strangers. I liked hanging out with my close friends and in one-on-one settings. However, the beauty of this networking technique is that it works equally well for introverts as it does extroverts. My wife grew up a socialite. She thinks I'm lying whenever I tell her I used to be an introverted geek as do most of my new friends. I didn't have to do anything I felt was fake. In fact, I feel I'm being more genuine when I network like this. I will admit the first two years were brutal. A lot of trial and even more error. I made a lot of mistakes. It’s just like learning a new sport or becoming good at it: you have to miss a lot of shots and lose a lot of games. Oh, also, I'm not into sports or cars. Never was and I'm still not. Luckily, I didn't need to be when using this type of networking. If you like video games bond over that. Poetry? Then make friends with that. One my friends in Hollywood introduced me to and is friends with all the top people in the industry. He and I used to hang out and talk about ancient history. That’s what we liked. The only problem is if you are extroverted: you have to unlearn some things that may have become natural for you. It’s like you’ve been swinging wrong your whole life and have to learn a new way to swing. For introverts, you have to put in the effort. It’s hard work, but it's worth it. I’ve done some amazing things, gone amazing places, met amazing people and, most of all, met the most wonderful person in the world because of it: my wife. 


Q: I'd like to know how someone who is nervous of meeting new people and awful with small talk can network effectively.

A: Bond over the things you both like. Discover if you guys have things in common and bond over those. Also, remember that as nervous as you are, there are people who are just as or more nervous than you.  Go help them out. I used to be like this: nervous of meeting new people and making small talk. I never knew what to talk about. Now I know how to captivate groups and it come second nature. Networking and socializing are fixed traits that you are born with (like height or eye color). They are skills that can be improved if you are willing to put in the hard work. If not, I can't help you. I remember one woman who ran a salon. She refused to learn how to do financials. I kept telling her how easy it was and how I used to hate it until I put in the effort. She still didn't want to and lost her business. In her mind it was a fixed trait that she could never change. So she never did. For me, I thought I could change it, and I did. 


I really hope this post helps a lot of you.
If you have any questions please feel free to reach out. And email me on your progress as well! I want to know how you guys are doing! Always love meeting new people. I'm retired now from consulting but I always love hearing from people.


Good luck everyone. I wish you all success.

Hey everyone,

I learned a different style of networking from some bigwigs in Hollywood and, later on, multimillionaires. 

Thinking of doing a post or some posts about it. Let me know what kind of stuff you want me to cover or what questions you have. 

Just to clarify, the way they network isn't geared towards sales (getting clients). It's more geared towards collaboration opportunities. That's why most wealthy people do business in country clubs and golf courses and start businesses and do deals together. This type of networking is more for doing deals with the rich and powerful not servicing them. So, for example, instead of getting Bill Gates as a client, it's more about how to become good friends with Bill and end up going into business or doing a project together. Or just having him around as a buddy to offer advice. 

That said, this type of networking really changed my life. I've had opportunities, offers, gone to places and met people I never thought was possible. I've taught it to other people, mostly entrepreneurs who were shy or didn't know how to meet and make friends with investors or CEOs or famous people. For these people, traditional networking events weren't really getting them anywhere or, if it did, it was very slowly. 

PM me or just comment here suggestions, questions, etc. I'll try to cover them in my post. 

If you want me to send you an email when I post email me at rgabrielshih@gmail.com. You can send questions there as well. 

Any suggestions on how I could make the post more helpful to people would be great! Thanks for your help!"

> Dear Mr. Eastman:

> It is with great regret that we must inform you of the tragic death of your brother-in-law, Raymond Owen Fugitt, which occurred at Kosnipata, Peru, on approximately May 23, 1952. Unfortunately, due to the remoteness of the scene of death, we have to date been unable to obtain a complete report covering the circumstances of death.

\- Bernard F. Heiler, American Consulate

[Raymond Owen Fugitt](https://imgur.com/a/IRfhqS4) was not native to Paucartambo, or to Peru, or to South America at all. In fact, he was born in the small town of Ellensburg, Washington, far on the other side of the equator from the remote branch of the Amazon River where he would meet his untimely death. His body would be buried by the missionaries with whom he had been staying, and his story would become the family legend that first ignited my own interest in unresolved mysteries.

While the legend that shaped my childhood is exaggerated by countless retellings, the story that I've pieced together here is based on a significant body of letters, official documentation from the Peruvian government and American Foreign Service, newspaper articles, and the personal effects that were able to be returned to the family. His younger sister is turning 100 this upcoming February, and my lifelong fascination with his case inspired her some years ago to pass those effects on to me. What remains of them, at least. Most of what originally came back from Peru is long since lost apart from a package of maps, receipts, scribbled notes, newspaper clippings, business cards, proofs of vaccination, a birth registration card, a 100 Boliviano note, and a watch chain, but the original copies of the letters and documentation regarding his death prove invaluable in recreating his story.

Even without familial exaggeration, the questions at the heart of the mystery remain unanswered.

##Journey to the Queros

Ray had been in South America for four years on the morning that he set out into the jungle for the last time. Having spent the prior decade traveling the world as a utilityman on steamships, he eventually decided to abandon steam in favor of gold and arrived in Argentina in the spring of 1948. He was presumably successful in his work and stayed there for several years before making his way to Bolivia in 1951 and then Lima, Peru in 1952. There, he met a journalist and fellow American by the name of [C.N. Griffis](http://www.peruviantimes.com/about-2/), who had been in Peru for forty years working first as an editor of the West Coast Leader and then as the founder of the Peruvian Times.

The two became fast friends. Ray kept the business cards and notes that he received from Griffis and the mission leader who would later coordinate Ray's burial named him as the best person to ask to find out more of Ray's time in Peru. Griffis was also well connected, and when Ray announced that he was going back into the jungle, Griffis referred him with a note to a tour operator named Ernest E. Berg. Berg ran tours down south, and would be the man to talk to if Ray wanted to go into the jungle. Stowing away Griffis' note stamped ""PERUVIAN TIMES - 24 ABR 1952"", Ray bought a plane ticket the next day to fly to Cuzco.

Whether he succeeded in meeting up with Berg is uncertain, but Ray did make it to Cuzco and was introduced to a missionary there named Dean Pittman. Pittman ran the Mid-Peruvian Mission, and would later write extensively to Ray's older sister. According to Pittman:

> Sometime between the middle and the end of April, Mr. Fugitt appeared at our house in Cuzco (we maintain a house in Cuzco since we have to come here often for supplies) and he and I spent some 20 or 30 minutes talking about the jungle. Someone downtown had sent him around to my house with the explanation that we lived in the jungle ourselves and could tell him all about it. In main, he wanted to know the geography of the area, the possibilities of finding gold, etc. I answered his questions as best I could and invited him to visit our jungle mission station any time he wanted to. That was the only time I ever saw him.

Accepting Pittman's invitation, Ray traveled to the village of Paucartambo and took a truck to the end of the road. On May 13th, he arrived in the Mid-Peruvian Mission's Kosnipata jungle outpost. He would stay there for ten days, sleeping on a camp cot in the hallway, before setting out one last time on the morning of May 23rd. Two days later, he was found dead on the banks of the Queros River with a bullet through his head and an elliptical wound in his abdomen through which protruded a small length of intestine. His death was ruled a suicide.

The facts of the case make it clear that Ray did in fact kill himself. The bullet that pierced his brain was fired at close range from his own pistol, which was lying in the sand near his body alongside his rifle. What isn't clear is why he chose to pull the trigger.

##Questions
 
On the morning that two mission workers came across Ray's body lying in the sand, Dean Pittman was still in Cuzco, unaware of what had happened. However, it didn't take long for him to find out. He immediately began searching for surviving family members until one week later, when he came across the address of an older sister named Della Eastman.

Pittman's letters to the Eastman family spanned nearly two years and give us most of what we know about the circumstances of the death of Raymond Owen Fugitt.

In the [first letter](https://imgur.com/a/lCvWqYF) to inform Ray's family of his death, dated June 7th, Pittman confidently asserted that the abdominal wound must have been sustained while diving in a nearby pool. The bottom of the pool contained a few sharp rocks on one side, and Pittman claimed that since Ray's body was found stripped naked, he must have been diving into the pool or fallen from a nearby ledge. After that, ""it is assumed that the severity of the wound (7 centimeters of intestines projecting from the wound) and the obvious hopelessness of the situation caused him to decide to end his life quickly rather than endure unnecessary and lingering suffering."" This was quickly established as the likely explanation in the [ensuing investigation](https://imgur.com/a/ANJGjfR). The possibility of attack from a freshwater manta ray is also mentioned.

Despite his initial assessment, Pittman began to have second thoughts. He asked repeatedly about whether Ray has ever been diagnosed with a hernia before mentioning in an October letter that the area where Ray had been found was not far from the territory of a hostile native tribe known as the Mashco. The tribe remains uncontacted to this day, and at the time they had a practice of firing arrows at anyone who wandered too close. The missionaries knew this first-hand. Pittman admitted in the letter that Ray's abdominal wound could easily have been made by an arrow, an explanation he reiterated later that month in [an article](https://imgur.com/a/um4mtT5) written for Peruvian missionary publication ""Frontier News"". In the Frontier News article, he abandoned his original explanation completely in favor of the wound being caused by a Mashco arrow.

That isn't the first time that Pittman changed his mind. In a letter from February, 1953, he had new information to report. 

> When I saw the gun and the ammunition in Paucartambo I was also told for the first time that an adapter allowing the gun to shoot ordinary .22 shells was found in the chamber of the rifle, and that this adapter contained an empty shell when it was discovered lying on the sand near Mr. Fugitt. Immediately I was able to reconstruct what probably took place...I believe now that what happened was that the taken down rifle, with a loaded .22 cartridge in the adapter which in turn was in the chamber, was accidentally discharged and that the bullet entered Mr. Fugitt's abdomen.

This seems like a reasonable explanation, but missionaries reported hearing 15 gunshots on the morning of Ray's death, which they explained was not unusual because he had been sighting his rifle. The empty shell could very well have been a product of this target practice. Also, the specialists who first assessed the body went into detail about the black powder burns around the head wound, but never once mentioned gunfire as a potential cause of the abdominal wound.

To take matters from uncertain to strange, Ray had a history of depression and was behaving oddly in the days leading up to his death. The police report includes the [following account](https://imgur.com/a/kE1HmVL) of his final hours:

> The persons that occupy the house at the Mid-Peruvian Mission on Queros River report that Mr. Fugitt could not sleep on the night before his death, and had passed the night pacing the floor of his room. In the days preceding he had been preparing a kind of raft with a canvas shelter. He had expressed a desire to go farther into the forest to be alone. It was not known under whose auspices nor with whom, if anyone, he was going.

Why was Ray acting strangely in the hours leading up to his death? What caused the wound that led him to take his own life? Was it a genuine suicide, a tragic accident, or murder? We won't ever know. All we know is that somewhere in Peru, on an island in the Queros River, is a tombstone anchored solidly to the bedrock on which are inscribed the following words:

> RAYMOND OWEN FUGITT

> 1952

> [PEACE AT LAST](https://imgur.com/a/Fsi3kc5) 

#Finding Ray

No one in my family has ever visited Ray's tombstone. Based on a hand drawn map by Dean Pittman and his descriptions of the site, Ray's final resting place is fairly deep in the jungle just south of Manu National Forest on what is now known as the Keros River.

I'll have more to write when I take on that particular mystery.After I came out to her a few years ago, I ended up having to ask her a week later to stop calling all of our relatives to tell them how important it was that they support me. We have had countless conversations on the nature of gender and the experience of being a woman, and she's taken to calling me ""Beautiful"" as a pet name. When we celebrated her 100th birthday this February, she thanked me for challenging her perspectives. We each tell the other that the other is our hero.

She's not very coherent right now and it's tough to make out what she's saying most of the time, but her face lit up when I arrived this evening and walked into her bedroom. Even through the two layers of masks obscuring my face, she saw me, smiled, and said, ""Beautiful!""

She could go tonight, she could go tomorrow. She probably won't see the weekend. I'm just grateful that she's sleeping soundly and I hope that she's dreaming happy dreams. I'll be here by her side should that change.

If you have a glass of anything tasty nearby at any point this week, please give a toast to a remarkable woman. Her name is Shirley Jean and she's my Granny Bear.

Update: It's 8am and she's telling us that it's time to put on makeup and head out. I suggest that we go for a jog and she gives me her mischievous grin and nods.

Thank you everyone for all of your wonderful responses! I just snatched a couple hours of sleep (my older sister tagging in to stand watch), and they were a lovely surprise to wake up to. I can't read through them without crying.

Update 2: Granny Bear passed peacefully at 10:30pm on Tuesday, July 28th. My sister and I were holding her hands as she drew her final breath.I see a lot of posts on the front page that include that phrase, and it just seems kind of silly.

A few remained but eventually the entire camp was abandoned and the U.K. Government eventually reclaimed the island (and floating islands) off the coast of Ireland. Of course demigods were now known to the public, some embraced this and became celebrities, others became something akin to superheroes, but over the next decade they all found their own place in the world. In time, as with all things, the world saw them as commonplace. 

Recently however the islands that once made up Arcadia were quietly purchased and now the reason would become clear. In major cities around the world several nightclubs have been opened based on the Nine Realms of Norse Mythology. On arcadia is grandest known as Valhalla. Each is connected to the others by mystical portals. Of course for the grand opening all former members of Arcadia have been invited. Each invitation comes with VIP status.

Who is the mysterious club owner? The better question is what has *your* character been up to for the last decade?So since my work computer was being stupid and wouldn't let me adequately reddit enough to participate I couldn't really make a journal. Nor could I actually do anything journal worthy besides burn stuff and make s'mores. Also since I can't really showcase character stuff like some others have done with character images. I'm a terrible artist and computers are magic and I'm not a wizard I wrote this. Also I was really bored at work. I hope you guys like it. Keep in mind that this would be considered by my standards pre-rough draft. I just started typing and went with it. Let me know what you think. 


[The Story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-NatLwE8m-oKqIRV9lZYyQjqHcPvR6qqB8SlREivz0k/edit?usp=docslist_api)**Edit** forgot to mention the first time around this oarty is a multi-day event

Wade has managed to use eight of the the larger floating island bits (how? Don't ask questions) to create a massive party based on the Seven Deadly Sins.

Sloth: This is the lowest island and easiest to reach. It has nothing but comfortable surfaces on either side of the main walkway. Be careful however, one you lay on one of these cushions it is nearly impossible to get up without aid. This is in part to them being incredibly fluffy, but also an enchantment making you feel more tired the longer you lay there (the enchantment breaks when the party ends).

Envy: This one is next and situated where you can easily see the other islands and what is happening on them. Nothing else. Just the ability to see the fun of others and to desire it. From here the next five islands can be reached.

(The next islands go in a clockwise pattern around Envy starting at the 12 O'clock position. They are also connected to one another.)

Wrath: A fighting arena with many soft weapons where all can fight to let off all their aggression. The weapons are of course enchanted to make one angry. This enchantment is only maintained while the weapons are held and the weapons will lose the enchantments after a time. It is also set up so no one can be seriously hurt (how? Stop with the questions).

Gluttony: It's a feast. Food of all types are available and drinks to compliment (both alcoholic and non) for you to gorge yourselves on. 

Pride: It is a podium where everyone can debate about how great they are. There are enough microphones for everyone and you can't be heard outside of the island.

Greed: Casino. Gambling of all sorts don't lose too much. 

Lust: Do I have to explain it? It's set up to facilitate...activities of an intimate nature. For the shy among us there are private areas. There are beds in the open, and an orgy pit for the adventurous (Wade always wanted one of those). There are any number of implements and things for all tastes. 

Total Debauchery: the island above the rest and with the ability to be reached by the others. It has elements of the most fun (in Wade's opinon) islands: so it has a smaller feast, bits of gambling, open bar, smaller orgy pit (and private areas) also some unenchanted cushions because they're so damned comfy.

**REMINDER:** all NSFW activities (including lust island) are for characters over 18. The rest of you must be content without an orgy pit. Also all enchantments are limited to their respective islands. *Wade is in the cargo hold of his ship working on the droid he salvaged from the last job. It's really the only thing he can do to stop himself from thinking about the ghost from the derelict star destroyer. He doesn't like that thing or trust it, or how much it knew. As he drifts back into those thoughts he pushes them away and keeps working using various salvaged pieces of the droideka and other bits. Occasional curses can be heard as can the clanking of tools.* 

*Eventually he takes a break from the droid  and places the armor bits and pistols he scavenged in storage until he decides to sell them. Finally he settles down and takes a drink of some nice Corellian whiskey as he stares down the broken droid.* *The time has come to unveil his secret project. Wade has his morning coffee (yes I deleted that one in lieu of this one) then takes a cloth covered device to the roof of the pelican.  This device is about the size of an R2 series astromech droid (if you don't know then shame on you), he romives the cloth and taps his datapad.* 

*The machine springs to life though only afew lights on it would give it away. He taps a few more buttons and waits. A few moments later some sparse flakes of snow start falling on the pelican. The flurry grows larger and heavier until it is snowing over the entire canyon. There should be a nice layer of snow, enough for snowmen and snowballs, in a couple of hours.* 

Merry Christmas Blood Gulch, hope you have a sweater. 

*Wade makes another pot of coffee and sits on the roof enjoying the snow.***Thousands of Years in the Future:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wade steps of the rot and ruin on a war torn planet. In the distance he can see what remains of a sign reading “Paradise.” As he picks through the rubble he talks to himself, quoting a now ancient song.

“‘Heute zieh’ ich meine Runden, seh die Welt in Trümmern liegen.’ Why? What made *this* city so important? Why did it have to be destroyed? What made so many sim-troopers and Freelancers, so many friends, come here?” He wanders around in silence for a while.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have been here, but he was busy with other experiments. Maybe if he had joined the others he may have been able to prevent what happened. Able to stop the obliteration of a city that spawned a war even more massive and destructive than the Great War.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s been he long enough, and he still has a long journey ahead. He holds up a strange gun that has a box as the barrel with what looks like a glowing green vacuum tube on top. He pulls the trigger and a blast of energy launches forward before becoming a bright green, circular portal. Without hesitation Wade steps through and the portal collapses behind him. 

**Even Further Into the Future:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of all things is really quite beautiful. Wade stands watching as the last star in the galaxy dies. In only minutes it burns off the last of its fuel leaving nothing behind but a few atoms. No more light. No more heat. No more life, except Wade. He only has a few minutes before too much heat dissipates and he can no longer survive, but the cold and quiet darkness is oddly comforting. Much like being in his old sensory deprivation tank. He’s tempted to just let it overcome him, but he has work to do. He has observed the control group for the galaxy. Now to add some stimuli. To see if he can change anything, and he knows exactly where to go first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wade holds up his portal gun just as he’s done many times before and fires. Just as it always does it creates a bright green portal and he steps through into a bustling city. As he does the vacuum tube on top of the gun shatters. 

“Fuck! Looks like I’m making Paradise home until I can invent the parts to fix this.”

(Ooc: Little bit earlier than I wanted to post something like this but I saw the contest and decoded to do it anyway. And this should go without saying but you never know: unless your character has a reason to know, like knowing him well from blood gulch, you don't know he's Wade. Still just The Bartender)*A huge banquet has been catered to the camp, because Wade can't cook and Emerald is too busy worrying about a bunch of sick mortals. This banquet has more than enough of anything you could want. Unless it's like some super rare delecacy or uncommon regional dish.*

*Of course it's all charged to the Nova Scotia Liberation Front.**Wade leaves the red mess hall then he showers and heads to the Pelican. Ince he arrives he begins mixing different hormones and chemicals. Then he adds some other fun gene therapy stuff. He then comms Cambria.* 

Hey Comic Sans you ready to become a bitch?"

mouettefluo,1,6,"Female Kevin (FK) in my class this semester. Entry level course. Students are around 18 years old. First week.

I teach physics. That day, I used an example based on the scan of a running body. I then let the student work on another example based on a javelin. 

FK raises her hand to signal she has a question. I walk to her desk and she asks:

- can you tell me what my finger has ? 

I don't understand so I freeze, confused.

She then puts her finger really close to my face and I see some reddish skin shedding. 

- my finger, it hurts and I don't know what it is.

I'm baffled and I say I'm not a doctor and that questions about physics would be more appropriate.

- well... you talked about the body of a person running. I thought you were a doctor.



**
A few days later, we are in the computer lab. They have to follow a few steps, written on a sheet of paper, to retrieve some files.

She raises her hand. Apparently, the computer is broken. She says that when she follows the first step, the computer shuts down.

First step is to click on the ""start menu"".
She repeatedly pushed the power button. The ""start button"".

**

She did a few other dumb things not worth mentioning but she managed a 0 on her final exam. The weird part is that her copy was not blank. In fact, it was filled with words and equations. Nothing made sense. But it wasnt like some students do when they don't know the answer. Usually those are copying formulas for the sake of putting something on the paper and you can see on paper that those  students do not feel strongly about their performance. Her exam was not like that. It was an actual ""resolution "" of the problem. Basic algebra logic was thrown out of the window, but her way of giving her answers was full of confidence. I don't know if it makes sense. Anyway, never seen someone so blind about their lack of skills. 

She failed way under the passing grade. Asked to see her exam in my office. Tried to argue about my grading being to harsh. I explained calmly how everything was defying reality on her copy, but she was still arguing some of it was good. 

I'm simplifying here, but her arguments were like : ok, you said I should have used the conservative principle of energy here and the answer was 256, but my answer is 28 and at least I have one correct digit, even without using the right approach. 

I don't even know how she made it that far. 
I don't even know how she will be able to provide to herself as an adult. Now that I have a decent portfolio, I’ve finally launched my website and started being active on all platform to push my business.

I’ve been contacted directly via my website for a possible gig. Nude family portrait mother-daughter. They sent me their mood board, which was of great taste and in a style I could totally deliver. Never done nudes before, but portrait, boudoir and family photo.

I feel confident I can deliver what they want. We’ve discussed pricing. Agreed to do it indoor. They evoqued wanting to do it at home so I’ll not charge for the studio rental. Which I’m not against but not totally confortable with.

A few times during our exchanges she asked if I wanted to see pictures of them. Which I didn’t acknowledge. At the end, when we agreed that we would keep in touch to plan for a prep meeting and confirm a deposit she said:

Don’t you want to see pictures of us?

I replied that I didn’t need that information unless one or more of them were bound to a wheelchair or similar that would need planning the logistics on my side. 

She sent pictures anyway. They are pretty, they look alike very much. I said a nice comment about their eyes and said to reach out to me two months ahead of their desired shoot date.

Today, she replied to me with pics that her daughters took for another photographer (like polaroid) that they decided not to work with.

They were selfies of her nude daughters. They are both minor (15-17) and that’s when I started to feel uncomfortable. This is child porn. To the eyes of the law. 

I know artsy people are more...okay with nudity so I don’t mind people being confortable being nude with their family for a photoshoot, all model release signed ahead.

How do I go from there. Do I just drop this potential client ? Is there a way to kindly explain to them how I feel about a mom (allegedly) sending her daughters nude?

Is this a scam or just an unusual family dynamics on display .

Advice greatly needed.

Edit : I'm a woman from Canada

Edit : as you all mostly suggested, I'll report this case to the appropriate autorities. I also signified to the mother that I was not confortable with the fact that she shared sensitive pictures with me, without me asking for it and that those picture were of underaged. I terminated everything.First of all I would like to thank everyone for their response on my previous post, to the exception of the ones who wanted me to send them the nudes. I sincerely hope you were just trolling.


I feel I need to update and give more background.


First of all I documented everything and went to see the police first thing in the morning. I gave them everything and told them what happened. The police officer was almost laughing seeing how pale and distressed I was. From what I understand they want to contact the mother and see what’s up. I received precise instructions regarding what was next for me. I feel relieved. 

 I searched for what is considered CP where I live and it’s not really clear. The police itself was not sure when I described what I saw.

Now a bit more context. 

I’ve done modeling for years. I have seen many many (legal) nude photographs and I’m confortable with nudity in that context, even if I have never done nudes myself. Also, I have a previous experience of a father/daughter taking pictures of each other, sometimes naked. I was in their studio as a model. The daughter was displaying her nudes on her room’s wall as she was developing the negatives herself, she was probably 16-18 yo at the time. So yeah, at first, when the mother reached out to me, her request was totally in the realms of possible shooting gig in my head. I just never questioned it (but I should have).

She didn’t tell me her daughter were minors initially. Which is why I engaged into more details with her. A bit later she disclosed they were. And since CP is not something I think about often (like at all) my dense self didn’t think much of it (see previous life experience). 

When she started being pushy about sending pictures I was weirded out but I honestly thought it came from a “I have low self esteems and maybe you don’t want to photograph me” kind of place.

At this point I was already telling myself that it was highly possible I would just bail on them. I just wanted to put her on hold and consult a lawyer to full proof a model release for nudity photoshoot. 

The day after, out of the blue, she sends me those few attachments and the first few thumbnails  I see are of what appears to be her daughter taking selfie of themselves in front of the mirror, naked. 

I did not downloaded or opened the pictures, I did not see them all. It was just the automated preview feature on my email. Were the pictures sexual ? I don’t know. Again, the law is unclear. 

In the moment, It was just a big wtf and I was like “ nope I think this may be wrong but maybe I’m just overreacting” . 

Anyway I replied to the mother that her sharing those pictures was wrong and that I was terminating everything. 

So yeah. I’ll probably never know if it was a set up for a scam, a simple hippie family dynamic or something more sinister. 

On my end, I learned many valuable lessons in exchange of a few very stressful days.So most of my friends have babies now, and I’m the odd one out who is childfree among them. They are really respectful of my choice, never wanted to change my mind, but I sense that it’s not a subject they want to explore deeply with me. No problem. 

I have a subset of friends, who are actually a couple and we had a ritual to meet once every week. This ritual subsisted during the pandemic, but on zoom. They had their first child last year and insisted on keeping the ritual alive. We adapted a bit to their sleep hours, no big deal. Sometime they canceled last minute. No big deal. 

My only problem is that since the baby, they minimize everything I say as non important. Problem at work? Pfff work is not important, a baby grounds you so much! You see how other things are insignificant!

They are a bit grumpy about the fact that I don’t ask about their baby much. Sincerely, I don’t care about baby stuff, but i make an effort to ask more than a few questions about how he is and how his development is going. 

It’s hard to start a conversation with them because if you exclude work, all the other subjects they don’t want to talk about. News ? Too tired to have followed the news. A new thing in town ? Well, they are tied home. Suddenly all I talk about seems vain to them. And I can understand why but its the way they look at me now that makes me feel inadequate. It’s the way they don’t try to maintain a conversation or never engage on subject I bring. Now, connecting on zoom is beginning to be stressful because it’s like I know everything I’ll say will be deemed as unimportant or boring. 

I like those people and I want them to be happy.
I’m just sad that I’ll loose my friends because I don’t have baby fever.I had a very cool lit teacher when I was in college. He made us read four very different book, one of them being Kundera's masterpiece. 

It made me reflect so much on what is freedom. How we can make our own prison ourselves, by our own moral choices. Even if  our personal quest is to escape control and seek freedom by all means, it is a form of prison in itself.  

I'm curious what is anyone personal take on this book. 


Edit: I thought we were the first of April. Well, it's not his birthday today, but soon. 

Edit 2 : Wow! Thanks everyone for sharing! I've been the only one in my entourage knowing about this book. I'm happy to discover a lot of you read it! I want to read it again!
For those who asked for the three other books : 

1- The Thanatonauts by Bernard Werber - Another very good read. Sci-Fi, pseudo philosophical. I really liked the subject and the creativity. Wanna be scientists find a way to go in the underworld by dying and then go back to life to tell the living what they discover. They then have to die again and again to explore more and more.

2- A book about a recent war. The narrator was a black man. It was a 100 pages novel, based on a true story, kind of journalism. The narrator (who I think was the author itself) freshly emigrated to the US, has to adapt to his new country while thinking about the war and his people. I don't remember the name of the book. It was interesting, but I wasn't mature enough to engage with the political content.

3- I'll try to remember the third.This one is not mine, its my uncle’s.

He works at a big media company that has a reputation to treat its employees badly. He is part of a subset of employees that is in a union. My uncle and his colleagues often use their situation at their advantage to come back at the many bosses that have power trips with the more vulnerable employees. Kind of to avenge the non-union employees, as small of a satisfaction that can be.

The company owns a TV channel that alternates between live and non-live programming. It’s the second biggest TV channel where I live and they strive to become the biggest. Due to poor treatment of employees and cutting corners budget wise, it was not rare at the time for the channel to go down for a few seconds, or worse, a few minutes. That would induce irrational rage from the bosses who would storm in the technical department and insult the first person they would see there. 

Anyway, this company finally invested to update their technology. They insisted on implementing it asap, which meant unpaid overtime, stress and just more reason for bosses to be disrespectful to « slow » « not in solution mode » employees. Especially non-union ones. 

The system they bought was incomplete. Some pieces were missing and my uncle tried to explain to them that they had to buy this and that for it to work smoothly. Bosses didn’t care and said they had no budget for « extras ».

My uncle likes to play dumb and do as the bosses say, with a grin when it does not work as he says  « i did what you asked...after I told you it wouldn’t work»

And another case of it happened. 

The bosses wanted the new system to be in place to run that night. 

My uncle was assigned to a console that was crucial for the live news program to ...well go live at the right time.

He noticed that the wrong cable were bought. One part would fit, but the other extremity of the cable was not right.

My uncle told the boss it would be impossible to make their deadline happen. There was no cable to connect the things together. 

Basically the boss told him to make it work. There was a few cables in another dep on another level of the building. No was also the answer. « The other dep needs their cables » . Well, of course! But my uncle wanted something to be documented by email to make sure there was blame to be put on the bosses and to protect his ass.

At this point, my uncle was 20 minutes away from ending his shift. He plugged the unfit cables and left their other side hanging. 

He left for the weekend, phone off. 

The channel face planted when they tried to go live. For at least an hour. Bosses were also notable to not read their emails so there was a solution (using upstairs cable) to make it run temporarily, that they should have been aware of but as the email was left unread by the other bosses...

End of the story. They ran on their old system for a while and they lowered a bit the stress of making the new system to be put in place as quick as possible.I was teaching physics, senior level in college.

This story is not about some student who struggles with Newton's laws or E=mc².

This story is about a delusional Kevin with a strong sense of self. 

At the beginning of the semester, I ask students to write a bit about themselves. It's an easy way to connect with them if we have a shared interest or it helps me to adapt the content to what they like. This students told me he really liked to tinker electrical stuff by himself in his spare time. Cool. The next course, I asked him more about it. He rambled some non-sense and I knew right away he just wanted to impress me. It was apparent it wasn't a serious hobby and he wasn't going anywhere with anything. I said nothing, because I didn't want him to lose face in front of me the very first week of the semester.

I quickly discovered Kevin was very loud. Not because he was speaking with his friends during the course, but because he would try to finish my sentences while I was teaching. He would make comments out loud. Those comments were not questions. They were just him telling how he already knew that. Or he would just say very loudly ''INDEED, IT MAKES SENSE THAT WATER BEHAVE LIKE A WAVE, BECAUSE ITS A WAVE.'' 

Totally useless and disruptive. 

After a few times, I had to intervene after class to ask him to raise his hand and stay quiet otherwise.

During classes, he would raise his hands to just rephrase something I just said. 
Example :
Me:  So, this wave goes up and down every 5 s. Its period is 5s.
He would raise his hands and say : SO, IF I UNDERSTAND, ITS PERIOD IS 5S, right ? BECAUSE IT GOES UP AND DOWN EVERY 5 s.
Me: ...yes...indeed.

He would then nod like if he just understood something deeply meaningful. 

I don't know who he was trying to impress that hard, but it certainly didn't work. 

Sometimes, he would try to give answers to questions. He would be wrong every time. I would give the correct answer and he would say out loud : Oooh, of course! I had that correct answer too.

What? No...you just gave the wrong answer a minute ago...Wtf...

I have a fun interactive quiz before exams. People are allowed to search the answers together. That activity was enabling Kevin really hard. All students were talking, so the overall volume was very high during the quiz. Nonetheless, you could hear Kevin telling his neighbors what the answer was and shout the why and how. It was wrong. Every time. When I would give the correct answer, he would loudly tell his ''friend'' : I TOLD YOU SO.

No...no Kevin, you really didn't tell him so.

Kevin really thought he was brilliant. He was building an alternate reality in his head, it was really weird to witness every reaction he would have when confronted to anything that would not confirm he was right.

I didn't want nobody to feel that their questions where not welcomed in class, so I made sure to answer every time he would raise his hand. Once , he asked : soooo...what you are saying is that X implies Y ?

It was a common misconception, so I took the time to disprove it for the entire class. An actual useful  teaching opportunity. I made my case clearly and even did a quick math demonstration. After a few minutes, I turned around to conclude that X does not imply Y AT ALL, EVER. 

He says out loud : ok...so...X does indeed imply Y. I was right.

The whole class sighted. My jaw dropped for a few seconds. I  said ''I just went on for 5 minutes about how it's never the case, so no.'' and went on.

A few times during the semester, he would come to me to talk about what he understood from the previous class. In fact, he would tell me his conspiracy theories on what I was trying to teach.

Him : So, yesterday, when you told us A, you really meant B. But only the brightest understands B so you hide to us the real answer is B. 

Me: No...when I say A, I mean A. Why would I lie to the class about something so ridicule ?

A few times during the semester, he would try to connect with me like that, as if we were sharing a special secret reserved for highly intelligent people. Like we were the only one to know the truth and that he was seeing through my mind games.

Another time, I was speaking with another student about a specific problem he was working on. We were discussing about a way to find the solution. Let's say the answer was 16. Nobody knew it yet. The student was asking me if his way to find 16 was legit. Along the way, he tells the number 8. Kevin inserts himself in the conversation and proudly say he also found 8, mere seconds after he heard the number 8. He was eager to tell that it was a great problem I gave and that he was proud to finally find the correct answer. 8 makes sense, in fact, it was a very easy problem when you think about it. You can find 8 very quickly in fact if you know where to look. The other student gave him a weird look. I told him : the answer is in fact 16. 

He quickly replied : did I say 8 ? *facepalms himself* I mean 16. I found 8 at first, but then I realized I missed a factor 2, because I was doing it in my head. 

It was impossible to make an error with a factor 2 in that problem since the math behind it did not enable a factor 2 to be possible.

More than I can count on my hands, he would do stuff like that, faking to know the answer or only telling the answer he got when someone else would say it. He would sometimes say it very quickly after it was pronounced so it looked like he was saying it at the same time.

Kevin had a big self esteem problem. 

The time really got angry is when he went behind my back during an interactive activity. I asked the student to rearrange the class in a specific configuration. I also built teams. He would tell students to do otherwise, make changes in teams (wtf) and mess with my configuration. I also heard him telling student to not do #2 and #3 because those exercices where not meant to be in the activity. What the fuck ? What do you know about that Kevin????

I summoned him in my office. We talked about his behavior. He said : you won't have anything to say about my attitude for the rest of the semester.

Nothing changed for the 10 remaining weeks.

He did something as disrespectful during a lab with lasers. When I asked him to NOT do something, he would just say: I know what I'm doing ma'am.

First, you won't call me ma'am. Second, you won't second guess my safety rules. He was baffled 

Kevin will likely fail this class. I just hope he will not be in my class this upcoming winter.


This happened during the pandemic, I was too overwhelmed to even think about posting it here, but it came back to my mind recently and I think you’ll enjoy that one...

We were half-online/ half in-person when it happened. I’m very good with names and faces, but at that time, it was all a blur mainly because I did not see them as often as prepandemic and also because of masks and turned-off webcams. 

There was this one student who would always « forget » his identity card for the exams. It’s suspicious because where I am, ~~it’s illegal to go out without one form of identification~~ (Someone pointed out this is not correct, but anyhow, students are expected to show proof of identity with their exam). He had no college card, no drivers license, nothing to confirm that his name and face were belonging to the same human. 

Then I realized that the person I saw the day of exam 1 did not look at all like the profile picture in my files. I thought: puberty hit extra
hard on this one...Still...something felt off.

Exam number 2 comes by and he does not have his card (again!). I explain that no grade will be issued until he is able to prove he is the one registered for the course.

Later that day, I remember that I have recorded video of him (it was for an assignment) and another audio file from another homework. Well, on both recordings, the voice is different, with speech patterns that are undeniably belonging to two different persons...that are clearly nothing alike the guy who shows up for the exams.

I contact the appropriate admins and send them what I got. One of them just replied 
« What the fuck, are you sure? »

They tried to call, email and meet with the student but he ghosted everyone. 

Guy was expelled from the institution.When I realised Kirk messed up every project or job he had in his entire arc (Seven 1-7 and the Revival). But not this one final thing : Lorelai's wedding. 

I'm so sobbing right now. Canadian photographer here.

So I'm shooting new faces books for many agencies in my city. I worked my way to their good graces, they are pleased by my work, everyone is happy,  scratch their back they scratch mine.

I shot this one model (for free) a few weeks ago. Since it was for a concept of mine, I do normal shots for the agency + my project. It's fun, results are great, I retouch the selection. Agencies are always a bit picky on how they want things done (and it's often different from one agency to the other) so I always tell them that I'm available if they need something adjusted to their taste.

I sent them the pictures at the end of last week. I hear nothing back, but monday morning, the model tags me on IG. 

Wow, that was quick, she must have been really happy with the results...oh...WTF ?

She edited the pictures with those ''IG fake faces'' kind of app. She changed the color of her skin and she looked baked. Her eyes are so white, it's evidently fake and she applied a texture layer in a round shape around her face (so the rest of the picture has not the same sharpness). It's look baaaaaaaaaad and I don't want my name attached to that thing! Her 1000+ followers from the industry can see it and my name attached to it.

This is NOT representative of my work. I ask the model to remove the picture, I call the agency. While the phone rings, I see the agency sharing the pictures on their social as well. 

On the phone, it's clear they think I overreact, because they say stuff like '' oh...it's barely noticeable, it takes a real connaisseur to be that picky about retouching style'' and after a while they admit not have looked at the picture. They assured me it's a first in 30 years of business that a model does this. I didn't want to bring up my rights and all the canadian legal stuff we have around ownership because I don't want to be *that* ballistic with this business relationship. 

They remove their sharing of the picture and say they will handle things with *this young models that is such a good human but still has things to learn*. They still look forward to work with me in the future. Cool. 

Meanwhile one of their employee reach out to me by mail, say they are sorry for all of this, but ask me to retouch the picture midway between what I did and what the model did. Fine, no big deal, I was open to modifications in the first place. From then on, I think everything is fine.

24h later and model still has her crappy edit up online. I write to her directly and she replied that everyone of her models friend does it and it's no problem, never. The images are HER images too and she will do as she pleases with her IG profile.

I. am. pissed. 

So I call the agency. No response, but I leave a message saying that I thought I was not the one to have a conversation with the model about professionnal faux-pas and copyright law. 

Seriously, if she had edited the image just a tiny bit, just because she didn't like the shape of her face or whatever complex she has, whatever. I would have been annoyed, but nothing more. But her edited picture is just so bad, I can't have my name tied to it. If I was paid for this shoot, it would be less annoying.

I feel I'm right, but for some reason, that I burned a bridge with an agency. 

If the model is right and ''all of her friends do it'' does that mean that photographer let shitty edit of their work circulates without complaining ?

Edit : So I got a call from the director of the agency. He excused how badly his staff handled the situation. That it was inexcusable, especially for a creative shoot where I did not get paid for the right of usage of the pictures. Model was contacted and she finally removed the picture. 

I just want to add that a model + an agency sharing one image of mine leads to at least 1 new client everytime. Because new models, actors, talents...discover me through them.  If it's the first image they see, and they notice it's overbaked, then they will probably discard me and pro makeup artist won't want to do anything with me."
glitterfruit,9,9,"This is my first post on reddit, so I apologize if it’s a bit rambly or formatted wrong. I just wanted to say I am so relieved to have found this subreddit. I’m a 24 year old female, and I was diagnosed with ADHD- combined about 2 years ago, but I never took it seriously. I did get medication and adjust it a few times (currently on 25 mg Adderall XR), but I never bothered to take it regularly, or get any education about what I had been diagnosed with, or try any strategies to deal with this condition. I feel so silly, because I could’ve avoided so many tears and so much anxiety while working to obtain my bachelor’s degree in finance (finally graduated in May!)


 I’ve dealt with a lot of self-hatred and periods of depression along the way. Even though I was diagnosed, I still didn’t understand why I felt like such a lazy and unmotivated person, and why I would see other people grasp concepts so easily and quickly while I felt like I had no idea what was going on, why I couldn't stick with anything I started. I have lost a couple of jobs along the way and beat myself up over it, without bothering to treat the disorder I have. No one around me seems to take ADHD seriously, so it was easy for me to do the same. 


I stumbled upon this sub last week, and since then I’ve bought a book on the topic that has given me so much insight (Driven to Distraction), I have an appointment to adjust my medication this week, and have started looking into getting counseling. This sub has really made a difference in my life, and I just wanted to say thank you so much to all of you for being open about your struggles, and offering advice. I have so much more hope for my future now.


**TL;DR:** diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago, didn’t take it seriously or realize how much it was affecting my life, found this sub and am starting the process of effectively dealing with my disorder, very thankful.

Logic_77,10,5,"Liam took down all Casper social media and when you open the app it says it's no longer available due to legal reasons.I am supposed to be paying $35 a month for 80 mbps as a deal for being with them for so long and for having cox finally come to my area with way better prices than what they had. But for the last year I have had a different amount every billing cycle. These past 2 months I have been paying $130+ and I was told since they had messed up I would be receiving credits to offset that so it was pretty much like paying an advance. Well today I got a bill for $75 which was weird since the credits should have kicked in so I called them to see what happened and apparently without being told I was switched over to their $55 price for life deal. When I told them I hadn't signed up for this I was told that it was a good deal and that I should just take it since they won't honor the past price anymore even though I had 2 years left on my contract. On top of that I was hit with all these bullshit fees so I'd still have to pay a left nut even though I had credits that were supposed to pay for a few months of service.

Also it seems I'm not the only one that it's happening to since there appears to be a huge class action suit against them across many states. If anyone has any more info on this let me know since I wasn't able to find who was taking care of that.

tl,dr: Centurylink is a slimy piece of shit company."

I've seen this a lot.

Guys.

The only thing that is absolutely set in stone is that Loli NSFW has got to go.

Please stop telling people  things that the moderators haven't said. Please stop telling people that the moderators have been hiding.

You're hurting your own position. You're preventing people from making their thoughts and opinions known. You're stopping people with good ideas and suggestions from going to the moderators to give them those good ideas and suggestions.

This was never about making the sub cater to a specific group of people, but rather to a larger variety of people in general. Was this a misstep? Perhaps - trying to appeal to a wider audience frequently is.

Mistakes were made. Regrets are had. Corrections are being made. Hindsight is 20/20.

Just remember that by destroying the conversation, you're not doing  yourself any favors. You will achieve infinitely more with a politely worded request than you will by screaming vitriol.

So do exactly that.

You guys know petitions, right? Do that. Become a collective. 

Just remember that pissing off the people whose opinion you want to change by insulting them is not going to color their opinion in your favor.

We cool?

We cool.The question is in the title folks.

What ships do you sail? What is your favorite pairing, in other words?

As for me, I'm partial to Marie x Saber Lily, even if it'd likely kil you before the diabetes even sets in.

Super Highly Recommended (Books which I can broadly recommend and I genuinely loved myself)

•	[Circe](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/09/12/circe-by-madeline-miller/)\- This was the best book I read this year. I’ve been a fan of Greek Myths, so when the author took an important but minor mythological character and added some d\*\*\* fine prose I was hooked.

•	[Jade City](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/01/05/jade-city-book-review/)\- My second favorite book of the year. I loved the setting, characters and gangster war conflict. Also, >!RIP Lon!<.

•	[Oathbringer](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/01/29/oathbringer-book-review/)\- >!“You. Cannot. Have. My. Pain.”!< What can I say? I’m a sucker for character turmoil, so long as it doesn’t get too angsty.

•	[Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/02/21/sufficiently-advanced-magic-book-review/)\- I never knew I wanted to read a dungeon crawler before. TMYK.

•	[The Paper Menagerie](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/03/14/the-paper-menagerie-book-review/)\- Short story which made me have feels.

•	T[he Eternal Sky Trilogy](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/11/23/steles-of-the-sky-by-elizabeth-bear/)\- Mongolian Epic Fantasy. Probably the best self-contained Epic Trilogy I’ve read.

•	[The Lays of Anuskaya Trilogy](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/11/12/the-flames-of-shadam-khoreh-by-bradley-p-beaulieu/)\- Here’s a criminally untalked about series. Do you want to read a story about psychic Russians with flintlock guns oppressing Ottoman elementalists? Go here.

•	[Throne of the Crescent Moon](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/04/04/2664/)\- Re-Read. Still good.

•	[Curse of Chalion](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/04/06/the-curse-of-chalion-book-review/)\- Re-read. I think it’s a classic of the genre.

•	[Obsidian and Blood Trilogy](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/05/09/master-of-the-house-of-darts-book-review/)\- Aztec mysteries. I’ll take a little blood sacrifice magic with my order of axolotl tamales, if you please!

•	[Senlin Ascends](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/04/13/senlin-ascends-book-review/)\- Slow start, strong characterization.

•	[Red Sister, Grey Sister](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/04/27/red-sister-book-review/)\- ‘Red Sister’ is the best magic school book I have read. Being an Adult novel helped make the tone feel serious.

•	[The Flowers of Vashnoi](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/06/18/the-flowers-of-vashnoi-book-review/)\- Eco-sci fi is cool.

•	[Wrath of Empire](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/05/23/wrath-of-empire-book-review/)\- Mikel and Ben are cool.

•	[The Utterly Uninteresting and Unadventurous Tale of Fred, the Vampire Accountant](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/06/27/the-utterly-uninteresting-and-unadventurous-tales-of-fred-the-vampire-accountant/)\- How can I not love this with a name like that?!

•	[Alif the Unseen](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/08/15/alif-the-unseen-book-review/)\- Here's the third best book of the year. I am of the opinion that this is the best Urban Fantasy ever written. Seemlessly blends location, time period, characters and culture with the magic and plot.

•	[Norse Mythology](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/08/17/norse-mythology-book-review/)\- As it turns out, Neil Gaiman is good at writing.

•	[Paladin of Souls](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/08/24/paladin-of-souls-book-review/)\- Re-read. Somehow better than 'Curse of Chalion'.

•	[The City of Brass](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/08/27/the-city-of-brass-book-review/)\- I like political fantasy. The more that I think about this book the more I like it.

•	[The Poppy Wa](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/07/15/the-poppy-war-book-review/)r- Do you have any characters you love to hate, and hate to love? Good setting, unpleasantly realistic characters.

•	[The Terracotta Bride](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/10/26/the-terracotta-bride-by-zen-cho/)\- Great setting, good characters.

•	[Annihilation](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/10/01/annihilation-by-jeff-vandermeer/)\- Eco-sci fi is cool, so I liked the book. Awesome movie, in some ways I liked it better than the book, but it was really an entirely different animal (pun totally intended).

•	[War Cry](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/09/10/war-cry-by-brian-mcclellan/)\- Fantasy Vietnam war. What a cluster of a story.

•	[Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/10/29/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone-by-j-k-rowling/)\- Re-read for the 20th anniversary. Holds up real well.

•	[Sabriel](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/11/05/sabriel-by-garth-nix/)\- Re-read. Holds up real well.

•	[The Bear and the Nightingale](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/11/09/the-bear-and-the-nightingale-by-katherine-arden/)\- Is good. Like the Slavic/Russian flavor.

•	[Welcome to your Authentic Indian Experience-](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/12/14/welcome-to-your-authentic-indian-experience-by-rebecca-roanhorse/) Is depressingly good.

•	[Lovecraft Country](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/10/31/lovecraft-country-by-matt-ruff/)\- Read for the Sword and Laser book club. Was surprisingly good. I would have liked more tentacles, though. I'll read more by the author.

•	F[rankenstein in Baghdad](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/11/28/frankenstein-in-baghdad-by-ahmed-saadawi/)\- Unexpected gem. Don’t know why I didn’t expect it to be so good when it had so many awards.

•	[The Last Cheng Beng Gift](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/12/12/the-last-cheng-beng-gift-by-jaymee-goh/)\- Motherhood doesn’t end after death. Couples well with ‘The Terracotta Bride.’ (By different authors)

&#x200B;

Highly Recommended (Books I can broadly recommend and I liked myself)

•	Jhereg- Re-read. Is good.

•	The Forgotten Beasts of Eld- Re-Read. As it turns out, McKillip can write.

•	City of Blades- Yay for depressing endings.

•	Kings of the Wyld- Yay for cheerful endings.

•	Blunt Force Magic- Good old fashioned Urban Fantasy, in the style of early Dresden/Iron Druid.

•	Star Wars: William Shakespeare’s, The Force Doth Awaken- “Wherefor art thou Kylo Ren?”

•	El is a Spaceship Melody- Jazz powered spaceships.

•	The Great Wide World Over There- Is good. By Ray Bradbury.

•	Armistice- Is good.

•	Powder Mage Short Story Collection, Volume 1- Check out Forsworn, but I liked them all.

•	The Codex Alera Series- It had it’s highs and lows, but Butcher consistently turns out good dialog and plot.

•	Infernal Battalion- I like Flintlock Fantasy. Sad to see this series, ‘the Shadow Campaigns,’ end.

•	The Book of Swords- By the departed Garner Dozois, a man who won more than 15 Hugo awards.

•	Star Trek: City on the Edge of Forever- By the departed Harlan Ellison. Is a graphic novel. Liked the art style.

•	The Wheel of Time, Books 2-> 4- Is good.

•	From Unseen Fire- Magical ancient Rome. A solid political fantasy.

•	Warcraft: Before the Storm- Warcraft’s first Goblin/Gnome lovestory. Also divorce.

•	Shadows of Self, Bands of Morning- When’s book 4 coming out, Sanderson?! jk, no rush. Some of the best, tightest books in the Cosmere.

•	Spells of the Curtain: Court Mage- Genetic engineering + werewolfs= weresquids.

•	Od Magic- Re-read. As it turns out, McKillip can still write prose.

&#x200B;

Recommended (Books I can broadly recommend, but had some flaws. Still highly enjoyable for most people.)

•	The Name of the Wind- What a glorious hot mess of a book. Plotting? Pacing? Who needs it when you have Kvothe!

•	The Pinhoe Egg- Diana Wynne Jones at her finest.

•	I, Cthulhu, or What’s a Tentacle-Faced Thing Like Me Doing in a Sunken City Like This(Latitude 47° 9’S, Longitude 126°43’ W)?- As it turns out, Gaiman can still write.

•	The Tea Master and the Detective- Sherlock Holmes meets Ancillary Justice.

•	Penric’s Fox, Mira’s Last Dance, The Prisoner of Limnos- It seems Bujold is good at writing too.

•	Arcanum Unbounded- -Sp >!Kelsier!< is dead-ish? Not dead? Pseudo-dead? u/scribblermendez is confused.

•	A Veil of Spears- Third book in a six book series. Is good, but I liked books 1 & 2 better.

•	The 5:22- Is good.

•	Brief Cases- Some Dresden-y goodness.

•	Childfinder- Octavia Butler is also good at writing.

•	Circle of Magic Quadrilogy- Holds up as an adult, Sandry’s and Briar’s books most of all. The author is good at taking important life lessons and writing about them in a way children and young adults can digest them without being talked down to.

•	Battle Magic- Grimdark YA, starring Briar and Rosethorn. Very mature for the setting, and as dark as it could be while still being true to the setting/characters I grew up with. Loved it. Were it not for the Deus ex Machina ending it would have been Super Highly Recommended.

•	A Shadow in Summer- It was well written, had stellar plot and characters but I found it lacked a certain ‘spark.’ I dunno, not for me.

•	The Cloud Roads- Also not for me. I can recognize that it is quantifiably ‘good,’ but what this book does isn’t for me. Like calamari or Rocky Mountain Oysters, I didn't like it.

•	Arabian Nights- Was really good… but I got the abridged version. I was disappoint.

•	Money Tree- Is good.

•	The Forever War- I read the graphic novelization as a part of the Legendarium book club. Liked it.

•	Plane Shift: Dominaria- This is the DnD manual for the MtG setting Dominaria. I don’t play DnD anymore, but I like learning about MtG lore.

•	X-Files- Cold Cases- Radio play. Great audio FX and engineering. Duchovny and Anderson phone in their performances a bit, making this gloriously campy.

•	Unbowed- MtG short story. Was your average story of a Dinosaur-summoning archer destroying a city filled with conquistador vampires.

•	Promise of Blood- Re-read. Not as good as I remember. There was no red herring, which meant the mystery was easy. Also, dog died.

&#x200B;

Recommended with Reservations (Books which I can recommend only to a niche audience. They might be fantastic to that niche audience, but to everyone else they might not be enjoyable)

•	The King of Elfland’s Daughter- Classic written before Tolkien. Not good by modern standards, but that’s because we modern readers/writers have learned from the mistakes this book and other early fantasy books made.

•	The Hope of Elantris- Elantris short story. I didn’t really like Elantris, but I liked this better than that.

•	Gilgamesh- The Epic of Gilgamesh is the Epic of Gilgamesh. Don’t let Utnapishtim hit you on the way out.

•	The World if Full of Monsters- My first exposure to VanderMeer. Was confused.

•	Eric: Discworld- The worst Discworld novel I’ve read- worse even than Rincewind.

•	White Sand, Volumes 1&2- Great art, meh story. Hopefully volume 3 goes somewhere.

•	Deadhouse Gates- I enjoyed Gardens of the Moon. I did not enjoy this. Will not continue the series.

•	Plane Shift: Ixalan- DnD guide for Ixalan. Aztec dinosaurs vs. conquistador vampires!

•	The Story of Kullervo- As it turns out, J.R.R. Tolkien can do wrong. This read like a boring prototype of the Silmarillion.

•	Furry Night- Is readable.

•	Rivals of Ixalan- This is the anthology for all the short work published by Wizards for the RIX storyline. I liked Angrath! Everything else was… okay. Also DINOSAURS!

•	Cadet Cruise- Is readable.

•	The Fantastic Art of Frank Franzetta- A gallery of an iconic book cover artist.

•	Tempests and Slaughter- The plot didn’t gel. It was readable and I liked it, but Pierce’s other work did this better. Will read the sequels.

•	The Second Bakery Attack- Is readable.

•	The Dragon’s Path- You know those books which you don’t really like, but you don’t hate them enough to stop reading? Won't be reading the sequels.

•	Star Wars: Canto Bight- Better than the Canto Bight we got in the movie.

•	Tortall: A Spy’s Guide- For super-fans only.

•	Body Problems- Confused me.

•	Return to Dominaria- Anthology for all the DOM storyline. Was competently written, but felt slightly paint-by-the-numbers.

•	Death by Séance- Oh lord, this book.

•	The Penitent Damned- I liked this a lot, but can only recommend this if you like the ‘Shadow Campaigns’ series.

•	Pawn of Prophesy- Nothing really happened. Good dialog though!

•	Amaskan’s Blood- It had it’s moments of excellence. I don’t regret reading it, but it was hampered by taking too long to introduce the main plotline/antagonist.

•	Serenity: Better Days- The old crew’s still flying.

•	Fires- Is readable.

•	Chronicles of Bolas- The story was unbalanced. Involved a frame story to discuss the past, unfortunately the frame was front and center. Because the frame was less interesting than the story of Bolas, I got bored.

•	Multo- Is readable.

•	Rogue Mage- I read this after finding out the author was dying of cancer. Is readable. I’d call it YA Dystopia meets High Fantasy.

•	Morning Child- Is Readable.

Recommended with Reservations

•	A Practical Guide to Self-Hypnosis- Straight outta the ‘60’s. Not so hot.

•	Lone Wolf and Cub, vol. 1- Didn’t click with me.

•	The Celts- After reading this, I came away not really knowing much about the Celts. Go figure.

•	Games People Play: Game Theory- Great Courses lecture. Good lecture… but I didn’t care about the subject so I quit after an hour or so.

•	The Secret History- Great prose, awful plotting and pacing. Also, all the characters were identical to one another save one or two quirks. Author needs to read more mystery novels so she knows how to write one. I quit reading after 150 pages or so.

&#x200B;EDIT: [I forgot to add a link to my Youtube, 5 minute video on this book.](https://youtu.be/5KWeYm2OdOY)

For the last several years I've been meaning to read this book. It originally entered my radar years ago when it was the book-of-the-month for one of the book clubs I'm a part of. At the time I was busy so I didn't read it, but I bought it anyway. Come this month, I finally had a slot in my schedule and I'm happy to say I enjoyed this book.

Now I'll be honest, going into this I had low expectations. Everything I'd heard suggested that this would be some sort of 'Hunger Games' rip-off. I think those low expectations helped me enjoy this story more. I came in expecting very little, and time and again this book exceeded my expectations. The moral of the story is to go into every book expecting it to be bad, so you're always pleasantly surprised.

Spoilers Below! You've been warned. Also, all reviews are subjective. My opinions are my own. I'm writing this review as an author critiquing another author's book, in an attempt to improve my own writing.

**BIASES STATED**

To put this review/study in proper context, you must know my starting point.

I am unfamiliar with the battle royale subgenre, beyond what I've seen in a few old movies like Hunger Games. I am willing to read YA books, but I don't naturally seek them out. I am not in the target audience for YA books either. Similarly, I don't regularly read SciFI, even soft SciFi like this.    

**READER'S EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**/ **FUN FACTOR**

This book made me feel largely positive emotions. For example, I felt excited and energized when events turned Darrow's way, and I had my heart in my mouth when things didn't. This book successfully engaged my suspension of disbelief. However this book also made me feel frustration in a bad way occasionally- specifically at the beginning of the 'battle royale' segment when it seemed like the interesting inter-class plotline was put on hold. I personally did not find the battle royale to be interesting, so when it began, I became disengaged from the plot.  

Overall, I give the story's Emotional Resonance: (B)

**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**

This book's concept was: ""The meek, teenager slave Darrow is enraged when his wife is killed. He joins a freedom fighting movement, and goes under cover in the ruling class in order to gain rank and eventually overthrow the government. While under cover, he goes to 'evil despot' school, where he and his classmates LARP medieval warfare, where the surviving Hogwarts House gets high-ranking promotions. While LARPing, it's kill-or-be-killed (and maybe get cannibalized)... until Darrow teams up with a nice girl and together they override the rules of the game and lead an army in rebellion of the corrupt system.""

(Note: the Hogwarts Houses are rival factions which function similarly to the Houses in the Harry Potter series, which can win awards based upon a point system.)

The book's execution was largely excellent... but I had a few problems. 

First, this was a four act book. I found Act 3 of the four to be boring. 

Second, this book was told in first person, present tense. I have a small problem with first person. I have a small problem with present tense. Why? Both of these are rare storytelling conventions. Combined together, I had trouble getting into this story at the very beginning. Similarly, at regular intervals during Acts 3 and 4 I kept getting bumped out of the story because of the present tense, because I had no idea how much time was passing. The story was very stream-of-consciousness, and while that narrative largely worked, sometimes it didn't.

Overall, I give the story's Concept and Execution a rating of: (A-)

**CHARACTERS AND CHARACTERIZATION:**

I liked the characters in this book overall. All the primary characters had distinct personalities, which isn't something you can always say for every Fantasy book. 

I will throw out a nitpick I have said in many of my various book reviews, that the aristocrats in this book seem to be evil for the sake of being evil. The aristocracy is usually motivated solely by wealth, prestige and a desire to keep the peasants in their place. Usually I find this to be lazy characterization. (As other examples, I had this problem with [The Book of the Ancesto](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/04/27/red-sister-book-review/)r and [The Rage of Dragons](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2019/10/16/a-literary-discussion-of-the-rage-of-dragons-by-evan-winter/)/[The Fires of Vengeance](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2021/10/01/a-review-of-fires-of-vengeance-by-evan-winter/).) Why do I find this to be lazy characterization? Because I could read *this exact same characterization* if I switch to reading another book with antagonistic nobility. When I read a book I like unique, fun villains. If the villains in any one book are *exactly the same* as those in another, I get bored.

At moments during 'Red Rising,' I felt that some of the aristocratic asshole characters drifted into such lazy characterization. 

Balancing this nitpick was my eventual realization that the aristocrats are all in a death-cult. The golds willingly send their children off to murder-school, even knowing the dangers. Further, they keep their fertility rate down/actively cull the 'weak' for the sake of keeping their bloodlines 'pure.' The golds aren't a vanilla evil aristocratic faction; no, they are their own brand of crazy, and I appreciate that the author took the time needed to flesh that crazy out.

Darrow: I liked him as a protagonist. He is basically who Ender Wiggan would be if Ender took super-steroids and became an Ubermensch. After his wife's death, he's solely motivated by a desire for revenge against the repressive system which killed her. In terms of having his own personality, he was fairly personality-lite. He had rage to him, the occasional moment of cunning, but also a surprising amount of mercy. I was surprised with how willingly he forged alliances and worked with the golds in the battle royale. I thought he would have gone on a killing spree against the golds given how high his 'rage' was supposed to be, but instead he kept a cool head and became a leader.

Eo: I did not like Darrow's wife Eo. She got barely any characterization, besides her desire for freedom. That desire, while understandable, was not enough to flush her out. Her fridging at the start of this book set off Darrow's journey. Further, I actively despised her after she tried peer pressuring Darrow into picking up the police's dropped stun baton and fighting back against the police. She was actively peer pressuring Darrow to commit suicide by cop, which is detestable on her part. I wonder if it was the author's desire to make Eo seem like an abusive partner, or if that was accidental.

I enjoyed Cassius as a protagonist/antagonist. He seemed very 'real' to me, insofar as any fantasy character can be real. Same goes for the Jackal and Apollo and Nero. They all seem like the sort of filth who would naturally rise to the top of a scummy society like the golds.

I enjoyed Mustang, Pax, Sevro, Titus and Tactus. For all their flaws, they were unique characters who the author clearly presented. I just finished reading a couple other books, and some of the side characters in them were bland. Not here with these guys and gal. 

I could keep going, but you get the point. The characters in this book are very good.  

Overall, I give the story's Characterization a rating of: (A-) 

**PACING AND STRUCTURE**

This book is told in the 4 act format, otherwise known as kishotenketsu. Usually I'd point you to a link on my blog explaining the 4 act format, but I can't because I don't have such a blogpost yet. I'll write such a post after I find and read another two or three books told in this style. 

What is kishotenketsu? Speaking to a Western audience, the 4 act format is a storytelling style which is an adaptation of the 3 act format. In the 3 act format, you have 3 stages: the Status Quo, the disruption to the status quo, and resuming the status quo. In the 4 act format, you have 4 stages: the status quo, the elaboration of the status quo, the disruption to the status quo, and resuming the status quo. 

Act 2 in the 4 act format is the main difference; in that act the themes, characters and pre-existing conflicts present in Act 1 are fleshed out and further elaborated. As a result, 4 act books can feel slower paced than 3 act books. These books can have two inciting incidents: the first, small one between acts 1 and 2, and the second major one is between 2 and 3.

Lets go back to 'Red Rising.'

Act 1: Status Quo

* This act exists in two halves: before, and after the laurel. Before the laurel, Darrow exists in a state of naivete towards the Society, believing the golds are fair. After the laurel is handed out unjustly, he loses his innocence.  This 2 half structure is mirrored later in the novel.
* This act ends when Darrow and Eo are sentenced to death unjustly. Eo dies, but Darrow survives. This is the minor Inciting Incident which launches Darrow's personal plot arc.

Act 2: Elaboration upon the Status Quo

* Darrow's no longer naive about the evils of the Society, but he still isn't ready to go on his adventure. He leaves his seclusion of Lambda station, and enters the broader Society as a whole.
* Darrow is trained by the Sons of Ares, and his body is modified to become a supersoldier. (This was my favorite sequence in the story.)
* Darrow passes the tests to enter the Institute (aka murder school).
* In murder school, he's makes friends... and is forced to murder one of his friends. He passes the test of being a gold; he's capable of heartless actions.
* This act ends with the Inciting Incident of Darrow being sent to the battle royale.

Act 3: The Disruption to the Status Quo

* The medieval LARPing battle royale begins. Stuff happens.
* The act ends when 2 things happen: first, Darrow learns that the battle royale is staged so another contestant wins unjustly (mirroring the laurel in act 1), and second, Darrow is usurped by a former friend, nearly killed, and exiled.

Act 4: Resuming the Status Quo

* In exile, Darrow is forced to start from scratch. he makes friends with Mustang (who's from a rival Hogwarts House), and together they form a trans-Hogwarts House nation, and start LARPing together. Through the Power of Friendship, they win the tournament and fall in love.

I ascribe to the notion that each act ends when the protagonist (or an antagonist) makes a choice which cannot be unmade. Act 1 ends when Eo chooses to sacrifice herself. Act 2 ends when Darrow murders Justinian. Act 3 ends when Cassius attempts to murder Darrow in revenge for Justin's death. Act 4 begins ending when Darrow makes the choice to fight back against the proctors and invade Olympus.

Honestly, this book has very good structure. It has clear, definable stages which make it very easy to understand what's going on, and what's changing. 

And then... pacing. I thought this book was at it's most enthralling when the inter-caste conflicts were brought to the forefront. Act 3 did not have that inter-caste conflict in the forefront. As a result, I thought that act 3 was dull. 

For me at least, I did not re-engage with this book until Fitchner gave Darrow the revelation that the proctors were 'holding the laurel' for the Jackal, and that Darrow was guaranteed to lose, just as how Lambda lost the laurel. In other words, when the book was at it's most 'battle royale' I got bored. I only started caring again after it was revealed that the battle royale was really just a microcosm of the Society's flaws as a whole.

Overall, I give the story's Pacing and Structure: (B+)

**PLOT, STAKES** **AND TENSION**

Truth told, this book's plot was the aspect about it I enjoyed least of all. As I've stated, the Act 3/Act 4 battle royale was my least favorite part of this novel. While I eventually had fun reading the royale, I'd have rather if the author used another plot.

The book's stakes were very good. Because the author began the story at the very lowest level of the Society's slaves, we understand the banal tragedy of everyday life for those oppressed by the golds. Darrow's failure means that that banal tragedy gets to continue.

The book's tension was also very good. Starting the book with Eo's death meant that from the very beginning we knew we were playing with life and death. Same with the Passage, when Darrow was forced to kill Justin, same with the battle royale itself when people kept getting killed. Prominent characters can and were regularly killed, meaning that the tension about whether Darrow would survive was up in the air. I felt that the tension was good as a result. 

On a similar note, the protagonists had to constantly worry about getting injured and dying. They had to scrounge around for medicine, making bargains with the test proctors, just to survive. I liked this. There was real risk with all the characters in the battle royale being superhuman juggernauts that they can just shrug off attacks and recover. By having people get injured and needing medicine, the author cut off that angle of potential lost tension.

Overall, I give the story's Plot: (B)

**AUTHORIAL VOICE (TONE, PROSE AND THEME)**

The author chose to write this as a first person, present tense story which, as I said, was a bit of a trip to read sometimes. At times it was a difficult read, but overall I appreciated what the author was trying to do. The author wanted to bring the reader into Darrow's headspace, making the reader feel every emotion Darrow feels. This didn't always work; as I said, I didn't always believe that Darrow would cooperate instantly with the other golds in the royale. When such moments happened, my suspension of disbelief kicked me out of the text. But overall, it worked.

I enjoyed the author's voice. I liked that the narrator broke out into song. I listened to the audiobook, and the singing worked. I don't know how it would do in a text version, but in the audio format it worked well. Similarly, I liked the texture of the author's words. The narrative had beautiful prose. It was clear and simple language, but had a certain smirking fluency to it which I enjoyed reading.

This book took it's themes of survival of the fittest, lying and corruption and knocked them out of the park. The Society pretends that the golds are on top because of 'Survival of the Fittest' gives them the moral right to rule, but really the corruption of the system destroys that argument. The Society and the golds are a bunch of hypocrites who stand for nothing. I liked that the author did such a good takedown of them and everything they stand for.

I give the Authorial Voice: (B) 

**SETTING, WORLDBUILDING AND ORIGINALITY** 

I liked this book's worldbuilding. When Darrow went under the knife and was sculpted into a gold, I was fascinated. Mea culpa, I have a degree in biotech. The way the author did the hard work of describing the science and surgery of the sculpting really drew me into the text... but I'm probably fairly unique in this way. Not everyone has a degree in biotech and would find this fascinating.

I liked the whole Greek/Roman theming of this book. Mea culpa, for the last year I've been doing research into the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Roman Empire just for fun. Hearing about 'Cassius,' 'Augustus' and the rest was very fun. 

Finally, I'll mention one last thing. I've been doing research into this setting, and I noticed something. The golds all have the naming scheme of (John) au (Doe). The Blues have the naming scheme of (John) xe (Doe). And on and on it goes for the rest of the castes. Here's the thing: Au is the symbol for gold on the periodic table. Xe is the periodic name for xenon, which is blue. And on and on it goes. The author had fun worldbuilding this.

I give the Setting: (A+)

**AUDIOBOOK NOTES**

The audiobook was narrated by Tim Gerard Reynolds. He did a good job using different accents for different castes of people. The Red slave caste used 'lowborn' accents, while the golds used fancier accents. When Darrow had to go between low and high cultures, he code switched and used different accents. I'll admit it was a bit of a lark having an Irish accent for all these Roman names, but I very much so enjoyed it.

I give the Audiobook: (A-)

**LESSONS LEARNED**

* I initially didn't care for this book's first person, present tense storytelling. I think I would have had an easier time with it if the author had done either first person/past tense, or third person/present tense. Both put together was a bit much.
* I didn't like Act 3 because the themes of inter-caste conflict weren't in the forefront in that act. This book's best aspect was it's inter-caste conflict. Therefore the lesson is to have you main plot/theme be present in every section of your story.
* Eo's death is an example of 'fridging' done right. Fridging is when an author kills a minor side character (usually a woman) to provide motive for the protagonist. Fridging is bad because it usually victimizes a woman with very little agency. In this case, Eo had A LOT of agency in her death. She chose to die. Because of her choice, it's not fridging. 

**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?**

* 16+, with adult overlap
* This is a Sci-Fi story, but with medieval fantasy elements.
* People who are in the mood for a fairly grim Dystopian setting, where lots of people die. 
* Space Roman vibes, with a freedom from slavery plot arc
* A battle royale, with Roman Gladiator vibes.

**SUMMARY**

This is a good book, with depth and nuance. I particularly enjoyed the characters.

**Literary Rating: Great - (On a scale of Perfect, Great, Good, Fun but Flawed, Not Recommended)**  

**Enjoyment Rating:**   **4.5 OUT OF 5 STARS**  (Enjoyment means two things: how much fun did I have reading this book? And how much did this book make me think about real world issues?)

Here's [proof](https://twitter.com/bbeaulieu/status/1458856013541650434).

If you want to lend a hand, his book ['Absynthe'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57500486-absynthe?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=8bXbO1Br06&rank=1) will be published in early December with Daw Books (under the pseudonym Brendan P. Bellecourt). Now would be a good moment to pre-order it, if you have money to spend. As far as I know this book is a standalone and not the start of a series, so you're not committing to a full series if you read it.

If you do want to read a series, I can highly recommend you read his ['Song of the Shattered Sands' series, beginning with 'Twelve Kings in Sharakhai](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611565-twelve-kings-in-sharakhai). In short, the series is a revenge quest by the gladiator protagonist Ceda, seeking to kill the Twelve Kings in Sharhakhai after they killed her mother. The problem? The twelve kings are all rich immortals who command legions of both living and undead soldiers. It takes place in a desert setting, and is Arab/Turkish influenced.

EDIT: just occurred to me to post the author's site [here.](https://quillings.com/shop/). If you want to buy the books, maybe go through his shop.Spoilers Below! You've been warned. Also, all reviews are subjective. My opinions are my own. I'm writing this review as an author critiquing another author's book, in an attempt to improve my own writing.

This review is longer than my average, because I'm trying to sum up my thoughts on the entire series.

Sometimes reviewing a book is difficult, because for various reasons the reviewer doesn't want to come off sounding like a piece of shit by giving it a negative review. Maybe the book/series is an author's debut, so the reviewer doesn't want to be harsh and potentially discourage the author from writing more in the future. Maybe the author is a woman or person of color, so the reviewer doesn't want to come off sounding like a member of the alt-right by panning it. As you read this review of the 'Poppy War' series, bare in mind that I'm trying to be as polite as possible. If you are a fan of this book and aren't in the mood to hear bad things said about it, feel free to stop reading now.

I didn't enjoy this series. I didn't enjoy it on two levels. 

On one hand, I think my lack-of-enjoyment is intentional by the author. This is a Grimdark series, and Rin is a deliberately unlikeable protagonist. My lack of enjoyment in that context means the series is working as intended as a piece of art. 

On the other hand, I found this series to be sloppy on a 'fundamentals of storytelling' level. This is the author's debut work, so it makes sense that this isn't as refined at storytelling. While I'm happy for the author's success with her debut series, I think the craftsmanship of the text wasn't ready for such hype and limelight. After having this series built up to no end by people on Reddit and other corners on the internet, I went into this series with high expectations. 

My expectations were let down. Arguably this is my fault; I came into this with high expectations. If I came into this with low expectations, and just wanted to read a fun series, I would have enjoyed this series more. If you just want a fun book/series to read, check this out.

I enjoyed the unusual setting, and Rin's uncompromising character. The war was magnificent in it's brutality. That's why I read the entire series; I enjoyed the good parts enough to push through the rough parts. 

A final note: I am a giant nerd. Because I am a giant nerd, I decided to listen to a 24hour lecture series about the History of Mao and China in preparation for reading this. [Here's my review of that here](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2021/12/17/a-review-of-the-fall-and-rise-of-china-by-richard-baum/). Short version: if you want to know more about the setting in this book, listenting to those lectures might be fun.  Alternately, if you want to learn more about the topic, you can watch this YouTube [video by the booktuber Allenxandria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBRiAJbYcXk), who both is a (I think) history teacher and a fantasy reader.

**BIASES STATED**

To put this review/study in proper context, you must know my starting point.

I am not a fan of really bleak Grimdark Fantasy. What is the Grimdark subgenre? Grimdark is the more depressing, ""realistic"" corner of the Fantasy genre. This series is probably the bleakest series I've thus far read- bleak to the point of nihilism. Rin is an villain protagonist; some of the other villains in this series believe in eugenics; the gods are villainous; this series contains lots of torture, rape and war crimes; the list goes on. This series is as Grimdark as it gets. 

I enjoy regular old Dark Fantasy, but not Grimdark. Because I'm not a fan of Grimdark, I am naturally inclined to not like this series. And wouldn't you know it, I didn't really like this series. Take my harsh criticisms with a grain of salt as a result.

**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?**

* 18+ years old. This has a lot of adult content, including gore, violence, and mental/sexual abuse. 
* Grimdark
* Asian-inspired fiction. This is a retelling of China's Warlord Era, but with magic and transplanted with pseudo-European steampunk technology.
* Military Fantasy
* A heavy anti-imperialist message

**READER'S EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**/ **FUN FACTOR**

Reading this series did not inspire much emotion in me, honestly. I feel apathetic about all of the characters. That's not good.

What this series did well was making me care more about the horrors of war. The war crimes made me feel genuinely repulsed- good job to the author for getting such a visceral response in a jaded reviewer like myself.

This is where things get weird. I give the first book in the series 2.5 out of 5 stars. I give the second book 3.5 out of 5 stars. And giving the third book 2.75 out of 5 stars. (For reference, 3 out of 5 stars is what I try to give most books.) However, for the series writ-large, I'm only giving it 2 out of 5 stars. Individually the books are better than the series is as a whole. I felt that the series-wide story wasn't as good as any one of the stories told in the individual books.

**(5 Stars= Perfect, 4=Great, 3=Good/Average, 2=Fun but Flawed, 1=Not Recommended)**

**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**

This series' concept is: 'The rise of a female Mao with magic, who has an EXTREME chip on her shoulder. Retelling the Warlord Era of China, with a focus on western imperialism.'

Individually, the books are more than the sum of all together. I had a pleasant time reading each book individually, but on reflection/having read the entire narrative of all three books, I'm left a bit underwhelmed. Rin underwent a corruption arc, but she was so cruel in books 1 & 2 that her descent into madness in book 3 felt 'Meh. Saw it coming.' This series was hampered by being all about Rin. I wish we had more POV characters- maybe a few scenes from Kitay, Venka and Nezha's point of views. Because Rin is so unpleasant, having her being the myopic focus of the story really hindered my engagement with the texts. 

(Again, I'm not a grimdark fan. Focusing on a very grimdark character naturally hindered my engagement. My disengagement wasn't the author's fault/a fault in the narrative, but I can't lie about my personal experience.)

**CHARACTERS AND CHARACTERIZATION:**

Let's start with the big picture:

In storytelling circles, there's an old saying: 'Make your protagonist likeable. If you can't make them likeable, make them interesting.' I'd like to add a corollary to statement: 'If you can't make them likeable, make them contain a spark of *something* in which the reader can recognize as our shared humanity.'

In my 'biases' section above, I used the word ""realistic"" in quotes to refer to the quality of recent fiction to claim that the darker and more selfish a character or setting is, the more like reality it is. In my opinion, that's bull. In my experience, love and mercy and other positive character interactions are common in the real world. In ""realistic"" fiction, there seems to be a distinct lack of love and mercy. Therefore, what we call ""realistic"" isn't actually very realistic. ""Realistic"" fiction runs the risk of getting edgelord and cringe- and for me at least, seem Uncanny Valley-like due to how there is absolutely no positive character interactions. I'm fine with reading bleak books, but I need light, hopeful moments to make the cruel moments seem darker by contrast. 

Did the Poppy War series ever devolve into being edgelord or cringe? Only very rarely. But because every aspect of this series was dark, the contrast between light and dark was less compelling.

For me, this series was thematically and aesthetically so ""realistic"" that it feels like the Uncanny Valley. The protagonist Rin is the apotheosis of ""realistic-"" she's a hypocritical warlord who lacks positive character traits, and abuses even her best friends. Do absolutely no nice people exist in this world at all? (Kitay doesn't count as a good person; his codependent relationship with Rin enables Rin's worst behavior. Also, he's a warlord whose schemes kill thousands of people.) Is there no mercy or kindness or unconditional love in Nikara? What about even one genuinely healthy friendship? The Poppy War setting is so ""realistic"" that it doesn't feel realistic at all (for me at least). 

I've seen reviews where the reviewer says they really connect with Rin because they too have had anger problems and can empathize with her. They recognized themselves in Rin's spark of rage. For them, Rin works. I'm happy for those readers.

Here's the thing about me: I'm super chill. Because of my personality, I *can't* connect with Rin; she's fire, and I'm water. I can only review this series by coming at it from my own perspective. I acknowledge that Rin works as a protagonist for other people, but her rage against the system doesn't work for me. This goes to show that a reader enjoying a book has more to do with their internal biases than the actual quality of the novel. 

But at times I do sympathize with her. When Rin has quieter moments, reflecting and regretting her past actions- when she realizes the humanity of the people she's killed- I do like her as a character. As an example, the drinking-and-incense burning scene between Rin, Nezha and Kitay in book 3 was legit touching. But those moments are too rare.

Okay, let's move on.

You might have heard that Rin is based on Mao Zedong. Because of this comparison, I decided to do some research into Chinese History so I can provide a more well-thought-out commentary.

* How can you have a character based on Mao and not have Communism be a major theme in your book? Mao is arguably the most powerful Communist ever. Rin doesn't have an equivalent philosophy to base her decisions on. Mao had principles and stood by those principles, even when it got millions of people killed. Rin didn't have principles. I think it would be cool if she had a philosophy she zealously defended.
   * Case in point, on p. 594 Kitay says, ""But ideological purity is a battle cry, it's not the stable foundation for a unified country."" Rin and Kitay don't have an ideology.  They just go around killing people who oppose them.
* On a related note, why didn't the Poppy War series have an equivalent of Soviet Russia? 
   * At the end of book 3, the heroes must beg the Hesperians for aid to fix a famine the heroes caused. The Hesperians are 'westerners.' IRL, Mao and the communists turned to the Soviets for food bailouts. AKA, not 'westerners.'
   * I get what the author was trying to do- saying that the capitalist westerners always find a way to get on top in the end. The author was trying to be grimdark, by saying the bad guys win in the end no matter what you do. 
   * But this grimdark edge comes at the expense of actual historical events. IRL, *the westerners don't always come out on top.* In Warlord Era China, the Soviets won, not the Westerners. In my opinion, in this case 'realism' came at the expense of actual realism.
* One thing the author did well with Rin was Rin's hot-and-cold attitude with people. She'd befriend people, only to execute them later. Mao did the same thing, making him dangerous to be around. I'm happy the author brought this into the text.
* I liked that Rin was fairly easily to manipulate. Going back to Mao, in his later years his wife manipulated him into destroying her political enemies- even when those enemies weren't Mao's enemies. 
* One thing I didn't like about Rin's characterization was how she used people as tools throughout most of the series. Rin is based on Mao, and in Mao's early years he had some empathy and kindness. According to the lectures I listened to while researching for this book, young Mao would share his food with poor people and support causes like preventing forced marriages. After Mao went deep on Communism he stopped caring about individual people to instead care about 'the people' as a whole. 
   * The lectures I listened to used the metaphor of 'you can't make omelets without breaking eggs.' When Mao was young he would not have broken the eggs. But when he was older, he broke millions of them. This is the historical basis for Rin's corruption arc.
   * The trouble is, Rin was breaking eggs from the very start.
   * I feel that if Rin was a kinder, more generous person in books 1 & 2, then her descent into madness would be more poignant. But because Rin was toxic throughout books 1 & 2, her descent into madness felt less emotionally resonant. Her fall from grace wasn't a very great distance.
* One thing I liked was that Rin makes the same mistakes again and again. She doesn't learn from her mistakes, just like how a real person doesn't learn from their mistakes. 
   * She trusts the Empress in book one, but Daji betrays her. She trusts the Dragon Warlord in book two, but he kidnaps and betrays her. She trusts the Monkey warlord, but he kidnaps and betrays her. 
   * Then at the end of book 3, she wises up and expects betrayal at every turn. Due to her paranoia, she f-'s up the peace summit. That's good characterization. 

Nezha

Nezha didn't seem to have a solid core to his personality. One moment he seems attracted to Rin. Next, they're enemies. They go back and forth, book after book, enemy to friend to enemy to friend. He saves her life one chapter, but a few chapters later his minions try poisoning her. His actions are bipolar, just like Rin's. It's clear that they love one another, but it felt to me like the author didn't have a good sense of his personality besides that love. It felt like his actions were the silent hand of the author at work, making the plot happen, puppetting Nezha like a glove to make things happen.

Making things worse, Nezha barely appears in book 3 as a speaking character. He barely got any characterization; we are required to remember the events of book 1 and 2 to infer characterization for him. That's not good enough; he should receive new characterization in this novel too. He is one of the series' three primary characters. I liked Nezha in the first two books. He deserved more limelight, given how integral his personal story arc is to the series' narrative. He needed a stronger character arc in book 3.

Kitay

Kitay is a moron. The narrative keeps saying he's a genius military strategist, but when the chips are down he's afraid of hurting people. Sometimes his mercy works narratively; for example, early in book 3 when he asks Rin to spare hostages. That seems like good military advice. Sometimes his mercy doesn't work; for example, in the middle of book 3 when he asks Rin to spare the people who just tried to kill her and instead keep them on as her lieutenants. That's BAD military advice.

Kitay served as Rin's '[Morality Chain](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain).' (TvTropes link). In short, Kitay serves the narrative function of being the angel on Rin's shoulder, encouraging her to not go around murdering people. In concept, I liked his use in the narrative. Having Kitay being the only thing preventing Rin going full axe-crazy is a great plot device. When he is kidnapped again and again, it crippled Rin, both emotionally and magically- that's good stuff. Unfortunately, in my opinion he felt underwritten. Kitay felt like a wet blanket. 

The trouble is that he was written almost entirely as an adjunct to Rin's personal character arc. I don't know if it was the author's intention to write Kitay as being in a co-dependent relationship with Rin, because that's what it seemed like. (Rin needed Kitay's emotional stability, and Kitay needed Rin's determination.) Even if so, Kitay needed more of his own personality beyond being the porter of Rin's emotional baggage. Conflict is what makes books fun to read, and there wasn't enough conflict between Rin and Kitay. Co-dependence is only as interesting as the conflict between the dependent parties.

Venka

Venka was awesome, easily the best character in the series. I'm glad the author didn't spend too much time with her, because what little we got with Venka was excellent. Sometimes less is more, and the little we got with Venka was perfect.

Next, about the unsympathetic antagonists. 

I played 'Ghost of Tsushima' a year ago. In 'Ghost,' the Mongol Horde invade Japan. The makers of that game did an good job of capturing Japanese culture in the development of their game... but I never got a really good sense of Mongolian culture. I wanted a Mongolian side character to quest along side, so we can learn more about the Mongolian civilization the protagonist was at war with. The Mongolians we fight in 'Ghost' might as well be Orcs from Mordor for all the moral complexity they are shown to have.

I have a personal bias to enjoy sympathetic antagonists. In 'The Poppy War' series, we never had a fully sympathetic Mugenese or Hesperian character who we could use as a vehicle to learn more about Mugenese and Hesperian cultures writ-large. In short, I wanted the author to take multiple chapters to prove to the reader that not all Mugenese and Hesperians are evil. But that wasn't to be. The Mugenese had the moral complexity of Orcs from Mordor, while the Hesperians seemed like the firebombing Spanish Inquisition.

**PACING AND STRUCTURE**

I think book 3 used the [Five Act Format](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2020/07/20/on-pacing-and-structure-part-4-five-act-format/).

Act 1: Status Quo

* The status quo of the book is Rin working underneath the Monkey Warlord, just as how she worked underneath Daji and Vaisra before. Rin's stuck in her ways.

Act 2: Challenging the Status Quo

* Rin challenges the status quo when she abandons the Monkey Warlord in her attempt to take back Rooster Province without his help. 
* The act ends when the Monkey Warlord betrays her, selling her out to Nezha. Rin's no longer stuck in her ways.

Act 3: The Turning Point/Road of Trials

* Rin is captured by Nezha, escapes with Daji and Jiang, saves Kitay, saves the Southern Coalition Army, executes the people who betrayed her, and marches without food across the mountain range to the Dog Province.
* The Midpoint Climax is when the Trifecta is restored, and then destroyed.
* The act ends when Rin is left as uncontested leader of the Rebellion against the Republic.

Act 4: Escalation of the Challenge

* After that, Rin trains new shamans, and goes on conquest spree across a defenseless Nikan.
* The act ends with her assault on Arlong, the deaths of her shamans, and her victory over Nezha.

Act 5: Climax and Conclusion

* This is Rin's descent into madness. She's won the war, and now she's failing to win the peace.
* The act ends with Rin's self-destruction.

This is a good structure. It fits the 5 act structure very well.

And here is where things take a turn for the worse. The book's pacing feels off; act 4 is too bloated (in my opinion). Simply put, at the midpoint climax the Trifecta and the Hesperian fleet annihilate one another. At this point, the book feels primed to end with the final battle against Nezha. Instead of the book ending at this point, the author added two new plot points: training new shaman, and conquering a bunch of cities one-by-one. 

The book slowed to a crawl because of these added plot points. After the mutual annihilation, I feel as though the story should have gone directly to the final confrontation against Nezha; a one-two punch of first the defeat of the Hesperians and then Nezha. That would have kept the tension hot, and almost a hundred pages could have been cut from the final novel. The epic fantasy genre is rife with bloated books- this was another of them.

From an intellectual perspective, I understand why the author chose to include this city-by-city battling- wars are messy affairs of conquest and consolidation. You can't just jump to the final boss and skip all the mini-bosses along the way. But the book's artistry suffered for the inclusion of so many added plot points. It would have been a tighter, more gut-wrenching Act 4 to have one climax follow the other.

(This is doubly true because the shaman Rin trains in Act 4 have no impact on the outcome of the plot. The shaman are neat and memorable characters... but as the writing saying goes, 'kill your darlings.')

Besides this quibble, this book is tightly structured and paced, and very well done.

**PLOT, STAKES** **AND TENSION**

I'll be blunt: this book/series contains plot holes, some glaring. If you want to know what some of those plot holes are, go to my worldbuilding section. Ordinarily plot holes don't bother me. All books have them, and one man's plot hole is another man's extrapolation on a theme or a part of characterization. I try not to discuss plot holes in any of my reviews, because they're nitpicky and generally don't effect the readability of the story overall. But in this case, the plot holes did take me out of the story on more than one occasion.

Moving on...

'The Burning God' contained 4 primary plot lines: the Nezha plot, the Trifecta plot, Rin's cruelty plot, and the Hesperian plot. I'm about to criticize aspects of these plots, but just to be clear I'm actually pretty impressed by the plots in this book. The author did a good job of bringing back all the unresolved plotlines from the prior books and wrapping them up. I've read A TON of books by more experienced authors who flopped the climax of their series. That didn't happen here.

WARNING: SPOILERS

The Trifecta Plot

This plot was really important in the first half of the book, but reached it's conclusion partway through the book when the Trifecta died in the act of destroying the Hesperian fleet. I have mixed feelings about this plotline. I liked Daji and Zuyi as characters, and Riga had promise. However, because they died early in the book, this plotline didn't reach as satisfying a conclusion as it could have. I wish the author somehow re-wrote the story so this climax occurred nearer the end of the story instead of in the middle. (Trimming up Act 4 might have helped this.)

The Hesperian Plot

To me, this felt like the weakest major plot not only in this book but also the entire series. I understand what theme/message the author was trying to say with it, but for me it never solidified into something satisfying. On one hand, I liked how the Hesperians and the Trifecta took one another out of the story. On the other hand, I didn't like how the Hesperian fleet was destroyed halfway through the novel so they stopped being a threat for most of the book, only to reappear at the very climax of the novel.

Speaking of the very climax, I didn't like how the reconstituted Hesperian fleet showed up at the peace summit. The point of Rin's descent into madness is to show she'd lost touch with reality. Having the fleet show up- confirming her paranoia instead of striking it down- ran in conflict with the theme of her losing touch.

The Nezha plot

Above I mentioned how I felt we needed more Nezha in this final book in the series. I stand by that. I liked Nezha in the first two books; the lack of him having a speaking role in this book disappointed me. 

Credit where it's due, the war between him and Rin was fun. I enjoyed reading about the innovative tactics they used.

Rin's corruption arc

Rin's character arc since book 1 has been becoming what she hates- a warmonger who goes on wars of aggression, willing to commit any crime and betray anyone to achieve her goals. Opposed against her in this is Kitay, who does his best to keep her on the straight and narrow. Rin's trauma is pushing her to punish her enemies, while Kitay is holding her back. That's good characterization. (I personally feel the corruption arc should have been slowed down to occur over all three books instead of just in book 1. But that's a quibble.)

The first two books in the series have very good stakes. I define stakes as 'why should the reader care about the outcome of the plot.' In book 1, the stakes were humanitarian: if Rin&Co. fail in stopping the Mugenese, the Mugenese will commit genocide against their people. In book 2, the stakes were the desire to found a Republic. I can easily empathize with that desire for a republic to replace Nikan's dictatorships. The stakes worked, and made these books thrilling to read.

I had trouble with book 3's stakes. In this book, the stakes are less clear. 

* In book 2, the stakes were establishing a republic. I, a modern person who lives in a republic, can get behind those stakes. However in book 3 the possibility of an honest republic is out of the question.
* So what are the characters fighting for, now that governmental reform is out of the question? Are we just fighting so Rin can rule over the ashes of a starving Nikan? Rin's a jerk, I don't want her to win- especially after she decides to turn Rooster Province into a narcostate. And because I don't want Rin to rule, I am less compelled by this novel.  

**AUTHORIAL VOICE (TONE, PROSE AND THEME)**

I remain impressed by the author's prose. Her prose isn't drop dead gorgeous, a la McKillip or Rothfuss. Instead the author's prose carries a brazen authenticity to it which lands like a punch to the gut. The narrative voice is well suited to the Grimdark genre: blunt, brutal and effective.

This series' primary themes revolved around 'imperialism, genocide and cultural erasure are bad.' Fair enough, that's a good message. There are a lot of recently published books which interrogate this topic. (The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, The Unbroken, The Empire of Sand, Master of Djinn... I could probably add twenty more if I tried.)  IRL, we live in a world in the throes of de-colonialization, so this topic deserves to be interrogated. For too many generations, the status quo of ignoring the legacy of the Age of Imperialism has gone unquestioned- now's a good time to tell the undertold tale of the victims of these tragedies.

Book 1 in this series handled this message really, really well. The author took various tragedies which occurred in early modern China and brought them onto the page- tragedies which were the direct result of imperialism. Rin is a war orphan, who was orphaned by an act of genocide caused by an imperialist nation. At the end of book 1, she gets her revenge against the imperialist nation- by blowing it off the map. Moral of the story: 'don't do an imperialism or genocide, because the people you wronged might get revenge.' That's some good old fashioned Greek Tragedy style irony.

Books 2 and 3 didn't handle one aspect of this theme as well. Here's the thing: at the end of book 1, the protagonist Rin did a genocide. According to the moral of the story, the Mugenese who Rin wronged should turn the tables on her. **We should tell the tale of Rin's victims, not Rin herself.** This is a small criticism, but an important one. In my interpretation, the author undercut the theme of her first book in books 2 & 3.

Rin's goal is to kick the Hesperian and Mugenese Empires out of Nikara, and re-establish the Nikara Empire after many years of civil war and foreign intervention. She justifies her actions because her enemies are imperialists. However, Rin is also an imperialist- her goal is to establish *an empire,* and she's willing to make vile sacrifices to achieve her goals. She's no better than the Mugense and Hesperians. The author did a good job of making Rin's actions seem hypocritical. That's some good theme work. 

Here is one aspect of the theme I didn't think the series addressed very well: the ethical implications of shamanism. The narrative took the position that maintaining the tradition of shamanism was necessary for the sake of preventing cultural erasure. That is a valid argument. 

However, I feel that the Hesperians were rational in their attempt to exterminate shamanism. Rin proves shaman are walking nukes- walking *mentally unstable* nukes. And nukes are bad.

After Rin blew up an island chain in book 1, I personally feel that shamanism should be treated with the same suspicion as one would treat nuclear weapons. Yes, nuclear energy and radiation medical therapy are useful byproducts of nuclear innovations, but are they worth the cost of potential human annihilation? Hesperian imperialism, eugenics and cultural erasure are evil, but the Hesperians are not irrational in wanting all shaman dead. I felt the narrative never explored the idea that Shamanism should be completely eradicated as an ethical choice. No one person should have the ability to commit genocide if they feel cholic-y in the morning.

**SETTING, WORLDBUILDING AND ORIGINALITY** 

And now we're getting into the plot holes. I'll start with what I liked before getting into it.

I like how:

* the gods are malign forces of raw chaos, whose only goal is to cause havoc on a mass scale. 
* magic interacts with drugs, both positively and negatively. 
* the gods almost feel like Lovecraftian entities- massive, powerful, and they don't care about humanity.

I don't like how:

* the shaman felt infinitely powerful at no price. The price the story used was 'you go crazy using magic.' 
   * I've read multiple books which used 'sanity is the cost of magic' as a trope, and none of them worked. You end up with situations where characters suffer psychic breakdowns at plot-important junctures. It feels artificial to me, because you just know the hero will lose control at the worst possible moment plot-wise.
   * Second, mental instability in villains is *really* hard to convey without drifting into problematic territories really fast. You wind up with 'Crazy people are eeevil!' stereotypes this way. For me, Rin's mental issues sometimes entered this area.
* Rin was able to blow up the longbow island, thanks to Speer Temple's magic. There are supposedly other such temples. I don't understand why the various factions don't view the other special places like Speer Temple as military assets in their war, and use them. Why doesn't Rin go back to the temple and blow up Hesperia early in the series? Why didn't Nezha use the grotto for a similar purpose?
   * This is the textbook definition of a plot hole, and why I don't generally like writing about plot holes in my reviews. I logically understand that the reason why Nezha didn't use the grotto was because he was personally traumatized by his shamanism, so *of course* he wouldn't think about using it. Despite this character-based explanation, this bugged me as a plot hole.
   * At the end of book 3, Nezha invites Rin back to Speer for the peace summit. *He gives her apocalyptic magic*. This felt like another big plot hole to me, something he should have known not to do. Nezha is smarter than that.
* I didn't like the Seal on Rin's magic; it felt like an obvious plot device used to retain narrative tension. I feel the author made a WAY TOO POWERFUL magic system, and then had to put the Seal on Rin after book 1 just to reset the stakes of the plot so Rin didn't use the overpowered magic to win the plot. 
   * I remember thinking after I finished reading book 1 that the author opened a narrative can of worms when the longbow island went boom. And sure enough, with book 2, in came the Seal to re-seal that can of worms.
   * Also, is this the first time in the history of this planet that anyone's used shamanism to commit genocide? With something this powerful, you'd think someone would have tried it before. And yet there's no mention of it. 

I have a few more, but you get the idea. Plot holes can ruin the enjoyment of one person, but maybe not someone else. **Don't take these criticisms too seriously.**

**LESSONS LEARNED**

* Too much grimdark doesn't work, at least for me. Soften it with some hopeful scenes.
* Sympathetic villains can make fighting against them more enthralling.
* Delve into unusual mythologies, and explore undertold stories.
* I liked the malign, lovecraftian gods in this series. Don't be afraid to take traditional tropes and invert them in new ways.

**SUMMARY**

I didn't enjoy this series as much as other reviewers. This is a solid series, but is rough in some ways. I can completely understand why other people like this series. Ultimately, I think I'm not the target audience, which explains why I didn't like it.

[And The Rest of My In Depth Reviews](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2021/05/13/my-in-depth-reviews-analysis/)Spoilers Below! You've been warned. Also, all reviews are subjective. My opinions are my own. I'm writing this review as an author critiquing another author's book, in an attempt to improve my own writing.

I was book shopping for the family, when I came across some paperback copies of an anthology of Bujold's 'Penric' series. On a whim (and a desire to complete my collection of the series) I bought them and decided now was the moment for a re-read. I'm starting with 'Penric's Demon,' 'Penric and the Shaman,' 'Penric and the Fox,' and 'Masquerade at Lodi.' 

**BIASES STATED**

To put this review/study in proper context, you must know my starting point.

I'm a big Bujold Fan. I've read most of the Penric's books. I would not be re-reading them now if I wasn't confident I would be enjoying them.

Also, I am an author who is planning on writing a book staring a character loosely inspired by Penric&Desdemona. So... yeah. I'm biased, in that I enjoy the dynamic of these two characters.

**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?**

* This is a good jumping-off point if you've never read any Bujold books before. The Penric novellas are nice and short, and well written.
* Adult, but YA readers can get something out of it (especially the first few novellas when Penric is young.)
* High Fantasy, 
* Low-to-Medium Stakes Fantasy (aka Not Epic Fantasy). These books are generally small-scale: murder mysteries, small spying missions, escaping captivity and the like. No Dark Lords, or end of the world stakes involved.
* Religion as a theme

**READER'S EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**/ **FUN FACTOR**

These stories are bite-sized and fun. They are books with serious stakes and plots, but not so serious as to be world-shaking, or world-ending. They are personal stories about mortal foibles- tales of murder and attempted murder, and the sundering of souls and separation from God/gods.

Overall, I give this series' Emotional Resonance: (5/5 Stars)

**(5 Stars= Perfect, 4=Great, 3=Good/Average, 2=Fun but Flawed, 1=Not Recommended)**

**SIMILAR BOOKS**

* Vespertine by Margaret Rogerson (In terms of having a religious protagonist who's possessed by a snarky supernatural force)
* The Kushiel's Series (In terms of having a similar-feeling setting)

**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**

In the forward of 'Penric's Progress,' the author said her goal behind this series was to write a powerful magician as a protagonist. This story was told in the '5 Gods' setting, where to gain magic a magician must be possessed by a demon with a human-like personality. Sorcerer Penric is possessed by 'Desdemona,' a demon with the personality of a middle-aged woman. Desdemona isn't evil, but she is mischievous. She usually gives Penric good advice to solve his problems- both emotional problems and magical.

I like this concept. Penric is an earnest, scholarly young man who constantly has Desdemona's snarky and bawdy commentary going on in the back of his head. This is a great, hilarious conceit, and works a lot of the time.

**Penric's Demon**

This was my least favorite of the four novellas I'll be reviewing today, not for any problem in the book itself, but because the author set out to accomplish too much in it. It was both the origin story of Penric *and* an attempted murder story. I personally felt that the two weren't very well integrated.

I will say that I like the introduction of Desdemona in this story. She comes off as being a mischievous spirit in this, like a petulant child who doesn't want to do her homework but instead wants to go on adventures. She urges Penric to relax and have fun, even if he has responsibilities. I really like this dynamic- she's not so much the devil on his shoulder, but the mischievous djinn on his shoulder, or the Sidhe Faerie on his shoulder.

**Penric and the Shaman**

I liked how this book felt like a sequel to 'The Hallowed Hunt.' The author took the magic system described in that book and applied it to a murder mystery... or rather, a soul-kidnapping. I think I enjoyed this more in part because I recently re-read 'Hunt.' I'm not sure I'd enjoy it as much if I hadn't read it as recently as I have. 

This novella was unique in that it had multiple POV characters. I liked that the author tried something new here, giving the kidnapper and the 'police' officer pursuing the kidnapper viewpoints.

**Penric's Fox**

This was a fun little mystery story- and it was an actually good mystery too. The author wove in the magic system, the gods and the mechanics of demon magic into a murder mystery. Further, the characters in this were well done.

**Masquerade at Lodi**

This was my favorite of these four novellas. It was also the only one of these four I haven't read before.

I liked the faux-Venice setting of Lodi, and the celebration of Carnival (aka Bastard's Day). This was a really neat story of the protag wandering around Lodi, looking for a rogue demon sorcerer. I liked the characters, and the twist in the almost-murder mystery. I especially like the side character of the Bastard's Saint, and how Penric unintentionally encouraged her to stand up for herself.

**LESSONS LEARNED**

* Writing episodic novellas is a good format for gradually investing audience interest in a character. The first time I read a penric book years ago, I didn't much care for him. But after reading 6 novellas about him, he's one of my favorites.

**SUMMARY**

This is good. You should read it.

Goodreads: [**Legends and Lattes**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60222807-legends-lattes)

I had difficulty with this one. Now to be sure, this is a good book. It's well written, with homey characters. This book is marketed as being 'Of High Fantasy and Low Stakes,' and that's true. This book is very cozy, having a found family vibe. But I found this book to be occasionally stressful- which is good, meaning this book is nonetheless tense despite it's coziness. I'll explain the stress later.

**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE? WHAT GENRES? WHAT MAJOR TROPES?**

* Found Family
* Adventure Questing Fantasy (Tropes Inverted)
* Cozy, low stakes fantasy

**IF YOU ARE IN THE TARGET AUDIENCE, OR THE GENRES/TROPES SOUND INTERESTING TO YOU, SHOULD YOU READ THIS?**

Yes

**MY EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**/ **FUN FACTOR**

This book is pleasing and fun. It was at moments tense, and I felt empathy for the characters. I've never read anything like this before, and I value this more as a result.

Overall, I give the story's Emotional Resonance: (5/5 Stars)

Note: MY STAR GRADES ARE NOT A MEASUREMENT OF QUALITY. They are a measurement of how well this book fits \*me\* as a specific reader with unique biases, and how well I synched up with this story. I default to giving books 3 stars, so this having 5 stars is a sign of how much I enjoyed it.

**BIASES STATED**

To put this review/study in proper context, you must know my starting point.

I like reading nonviolent books on occasion. This book goes out of it's way to have a nonviolent protagonist. Viv is a retired barbarian warrior (of the Dungeons and Dragons mold). She quit her old job, and opened a coffee shop. Now she sells coffee and cookies to people.

**SIMILAR BOOKS**

* The Goblin Emperor (Nonviolent fiction)
* Sunshine (Coffee House Fiction)
* A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (Found Family)

**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**

This book's concept is the story of a Dungeons and Dragons adventurer who goes into retirement, and starts a coffee shop. As a barista, she has to juggle the many stresses of being a small business owner on one hand, with the local mafia on the other, as well as her old adventuring life catching up to her.

This book is executed exceptionally well, especially considering that this is this author's debut. Paced at a brisk 320 pages, this book contains a heartwarming plot, good character arcs, and an emotionally fulfilling narrative. Quite frankly, this self published book is better than A LOT of books published from actual publishing houses.

**CHARACTERS AND CHARACTERIZATION:**

This book's greatest strength is it's characters.

This book was very warm and fuzzy when Viv is making friends and finding successes running her business. I think the author almost did too good of a job in writing this book. Viv's predicament struck a cord with me; I had empathy for her struggling like a fish out of water, trying to make her way in a world against her. The sheer mundane nastiness of her situation- again, being a small business owner whose livelihood is threatened by both the mafia as well as old enemies Viv tried to escape by retiring- I found to be really upsetting. 

While only two of the main characters were actually *human,* nonetheless  
I saw a bit of humanity in all of them. From Viv the orc, to her succubus  
business partner, to their gnoll carpenter and anthropomorphic rat baker, all are various  
shades of adorable, while maintaining a unique personality apiece. Viv is stoic  
due to her years of being a warrior; Tandri has a chip on her shoulder due to people only seeing her for her species, a succubus, and not a person; Calamity the gnoll is laconic due to social isolation from all the other carpenters who shun him; Thimble is a genius chef who is looking for his big break, hampered by being such a small, overlooked rat. Genre-wise, this book is adventure party fiction- a genre where an adventuring party goes on a quest to save the day. Viv, Tandri, Cal and the rest are the adventuring party. Only instead of this book being a standard adventure, the tropes are deliberately inverted. In this context, this book works well.

(Also, does anyone else think Tandri was some variety of ace? I got ace vibes from her.)

**PACING AND STRUCTURE**

SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION!

This book is largely well paced. If I were to have one quibble, I felt that it took too long for the coffee house to actually open in the beginning. This book's slow start could have been remedied by somehow opening the coffee house earlier.

This book was structured episodically. I think it had three acts: act 1 was before the coffee house opened, act 2 was after the coffee house opened, and act 3 was after the coffee house burned down.

SWEET GOOGLY MOOGLY, burning down the coffee house was a twist I did not expect. This book was 3.5 stars for me, until that twist. That twist is what brought it up to 5 stars. The twist allowed all the side characters introduced throughout the novel to shine and help Viv after Viv helped them.

**PLOT, STAKES** **AND TENSION**

I enjoyed every minute of reading this book, but Viv's situation was so stressful for me I had difficulty forcing myself to read all of it. I have no problem reading books with world ending stakes- such large stakes are by their very nature abstract and emotionally easy to handle. This, by contrast, I almost quit reading because the stakes here- namely, of a struggling small business owner- struck too close to home. By any definition, that's well-written.

As is this book's calling card, this book is 'of High Fantasy and Low Stakes.' The only stakes here are the fate of the coffee shop and Viv's mental health. *And it was freaking wonderful.*

I complain (a lot) about how a lot of series see the constant need to up the stakes with each and every story. Using the 'Dresden Files' as an example, in the early books the protagonist had difficulty defeating a single vampire; in the most recent book he's smiting gods. In the early books, he's motivated to kill vampires because he wants to save his loved ones those vampires threatened. In the most recent books, he fights the gods to save the entire planet.

For the record, there's nothing wrong with *occasionally* raising the stakes. But in long running series, if you constantly raise the stakes in each and every volume, eventually those stakes cease to have any meaning. I've stopped really caring about the 'Dresden Files' series because it's scope has simply gotten too big for my tiny little brain: in the early books I cared that Dresden was fighting to save his kidnapped friends, however in the late books I don't care that Dresden is fighting to save the world. The world is simply *too big*. I can't wrap my brain around it. It's okay for a series to save the world once every few books, but having crushingly huge stakes each and every time just doesn't work (for me).

**AUTHORIAL VOICE (TONE, PROSE AND THEME)**

SPOILERS

This book's tone was picture perfect. It hit the lighthearted D&D vibe right in the heart, despite upsetting so many of the related adventure party tropes. The prose folded perfectly into that tone.

The book's theme of found family was probably the best executed example of which I've read in a long time, if not ever. Viv employed and made friends of so many people throughout the novel, only to lose everything when the coffee house burned down. Then the book's theme turned back around on Viv: where before she helped other people, other people now helped her. This hit the pitch-perfect note, making the story resonate.

**SETTING, WORLDBUILDING AND ORIGINALITY**

This book wasn't setting out to be original, and that's what made it work. You've seen how many times I've mentioned Dungeons and Dragons in this; this book is a deliberate reference to settings such as that. This book felt as if an orc warrior retired, and opened up a coffee hose in Dalaran. Or a qunari warrior retired and opened up a coffee house in the Free Marches. Or a goron retired and opened up a coffee house in Castle Town. You get the idea. This book *deliberately* played into the tropes of adventure fantasy for the purpose of inverting them.

**AUDIOBOOK NOTES**

I started with the ebook, then switched to the audiobook. This was the correct decision. The author read the audiobook, and the author is also a professional audiobook narrator. He did a good job bringing the characters to life.

**LESSONS LEARNED**

As an author, I want to improve my own writing/editing skills. To that end, I like to learn lessons from every story I read. Here's what I learned from this story:

* Low stakes can be more emotionally evocative than high stakes, so long as you handle them right. I care more about an orc's retirement than the fate of the world, if you handle it right. Motivation matters; relying on stock motivations of 'saving the world' gets trite, so instead go for something smaller and more personal.
* Found family stories rock. 

[Here's a link to all the lessons I've previously learned.](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2022/05/06/lessons-learned/)

**SUMMARY**

This book is great. Check it out if you want a short found-family story.

[The Rest of My In Depth Reviews](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2021/05/13/my-in-depth-reviews-analysis/)Hey guys, for a few weeks now I've been thinking about compiling a list of books which are coming out every month. The reason why is because I missed the news that some of my favorite series had engaged in mitosis and produced a new book and I only heard about it months later. Never wanting to be caught ignorant again, here I am today.

I took a few hours to actually put together this list, and it isn't by any means comprehensive. I only went to six or seven mainstream publisher websites, so no self published or small press books are listed. If this topic gets enough positive feedback/generate enough discussion I'll make another one next month. Feel free to give me any advice about how I can improve!

PS: I have no clue if this post is against forum rules or not, so if the mods want this gone I understand.

This is my first full-length Tchaikovsky novel, and I have to say I am *extremely* pleasantly surprised with how good this is. Mea culpa, I like weird books. This is a weird book. The author had a simply genius idea of fusing together a Regency Era Comedy of Manners story (ala Jane Austen) with a Regency Era Military Fiction story (a la Napoleonic Military Fiction), with some magic thrown in for good measure. The combination of the two works surprisingly well- I saw it described (humorously) [as 'Pride and Prejudice meets Apocalypse Now.'](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/u4qzs6/guns_of_dawn_great_female_centric_story/) This was one of the best books I've read in a while, if not ever. It was not perfect, however. Let's get started.

Spoilers Below! You've been warned. Also, all reviews are subjective. My opinions are my own. I'm writing this review as an author critiquing another author's book, in an attempt to improve my own writing and editing skills.

**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?**

* Military Fantasy, Napoleonic
* Flintlock Fantasy
* Jane Austen Fantasy/Regency Era Fantasy
* Alternate History Vibes (but it doesn't take place on earth)
* Badass Female Protagonist
   * Emily's a tough fighter, while still being very ladylike as well as kind
* Adult, but I think anyone 16+ can read this
   * There is attempted sexual assault.

**READER'S EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**/ **BIASES STATED**

I am very much so in this book's target audience. You can go through my list of reviews, and find that I've read a LOT of Military Fantasy, Flintlock Fantasy, and even some Regency Era Fantasy story. It is no surprise that I liked this book. Further, I listened to the audiobook, and the narrator REALLY knocked it out of the park. This book is fun, clever, and well-written. 

Overall, I give the story's Emotional Resonance: (4.5/5 Stars)

(I default to giving good books 3 stars. To get more than that, a book has to earn it.)

**SIMILAR BOOKS**

* Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (Similar setting, storytelling style)
* The Glamorist Histories (Similar setting, characters, storytelling style)
* ‘Sharpe’s Tiger’ (Similar setting, storytelling style)
* ‘His Majesty’s Dragon’  (Similar Setting/storytelling)
* ‘Master and Commander’
* 'Shadow Campaigns'

**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**

This book's concept is: ""A Jane Austen protagonist must join the military to fight against (Fake) Germany in a hideously unpleasant swampland. She has to deal with despicable male suitors, her family's poverty, aboriginal demi-humans, and the bullets of her terrible republican enemies who want to bring freedom to her kingdom.""

This concept is fantastically well executed upon. Frankly, the idea to combine a Regency-era military novel with a Regency-era comedy of manners is simply genius. When put together, they flowed together naturally. Again, I listened to the audiobook, and the narrator did an excellent job of bringing it all together.

**CHARACTERS AND CHARACTERIZATION:**

Emily is the star of this show. She is the middle daughter of three, in an impoverished minor noble family. When her good and honorable nation goes to war, she takes it upon herself to act as a community leader, using what little food and wealth she has access to to help feed and clothe the common people of her township during the tough times caused by the war. Posed against her is Mr. Northway- the evil mayor of her village who was long the enemy of her family. Emily takes it upon herself to berate Northway into feeding the poor, while Northway responds by making fun of her for her mercy and kindness. They had a great dynamic.

When the war takes a turn for the worst, her nation becomes so desperate for soldiers that they start recruiting the women. Emily reluctantly joins the war, learning to fight like her ancestors in the name of the king. She ventures to distant, bug infested swamps, hoping to end the war before it has the chance to get much worse at home for her family and friends.

Emily begins the book going to balls and dances like any other noblewoman, but she takes her responsibility as the daughter of the local country squire seriously. She gives away her wealth as charity to those less fortunate, and supports important local causes even though the only way she can do so is haranguing her sworn enemy Northway into giving his wealth to them. When she transitions into becoming a soldier, her upstanding nature naturally transfers into becoming a skilled soldier and officer. She is not a grimdark hero, who is only interested in taking care of herself; she honestly cares about those around her, and she wants what's best.

The side characters are well done. Alice is Emily's ditzy younger sister who's obsessed with going to society functions, wearing pretty dresses, and meeting cute guys. Whenever Alice is 'on screen' I simultaneously love her and hate her. Northway is the self-serving mayor of her hometown, who secretly has a heart of gold. I could keep going, but there are many more memorable side characters who were fun. If I were to issue a complaint, it would be that a good number of them felt more like caricatures than 3D people, but in the grand scheme it wasn't a big deal.

**PACING AND STRUCTURE**

The pacing in this story is hard to describe. If you dislike comedies-of-manners, then the first 200pages or so would be very boring to you. If you enjoy them, they would be very quickly paced. I personally enjoyed them. 

The middle of the story was a protracted sequence of fighting and characterization in the swamps. I enjoyed this sequence, but honestly it was a bit bloated. The story beats about the demi-human 'aboriginals' felt thematically shoehorned in, and I'm not sure it entirely paid itself off.

I enjoyed the structural techniques used by the author. The book began with a battle in the swamp, where Emily fought the Denlanders. But then the book doubled back several months to the *real* beginning of the book at the beginning of the war, back before Emily became a soldier. This is a very clever technique, because it sets up reader expectations that this will be a military fantasy. Do you remember how I said that the first 200 pages were all comedy-of-manners? By having the book begin with combat, that combat serves as a promise to the reader that if they bare through the 'comedy of manners,' they'll get to the military sequence later. Aka foreshadowing! 

This non-linear storytelling repeated in the middle of the story as well, when the author doubled back between fight scenes and before the fight scenes.

I think this book can be described with either the 3 act format, or the 5 act format.

[3 acts](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2020/07/10/on-pacing-and-structure-the-three-act-structure/):

1. Before the swamp
2. During the swamp
3. After the swamp/after the war

[The 5 act format](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2020/07/20/on-pacing-and-structure-part-4-five-act-format/) seems more useful as a structure, however.

1. Before being drafted
2. After being drafted, but before the swamp
3. The swamp, up until Emily is captured
4. The swamp, after Emily is captured
5. After the war

Using the 5 act format as a guide, I think act 2 was a bit long in the tooth, as was act 3. I might have trimmed things up there. Acts 1 & 5 were my favorites, while act 3 was my least favorite. Act three in particular felt fluffy.

**PLOT, STAKES** **AND TENSION**

The genre-fusion plot was really well done. As stated, the book began as the low-stakes story of a humble girl of low nobility, going to dances, donating money, and doing her best to help her community. 

It transitions into a military story of the Napoleonic bent, where armies clash and struggle over marshlands- and young Emily is caught in the worst of it. She's drafted into the army, where she becomes a leader by necessity. 

Finally, upon the war's conclusion, the two genres re-fuse together. Emily reverts back to being a humble girl of the lower nobility, but still dealing with the trauma of war. The war's over, but even so the war isn't really over in the darkness of her heart. She has PTSD.

I particularly loved the resolution of the story. I've read some reviews, and people complained that the book *ended* after the climax. They are correct, the ending is rather abrupt. As in, *really* abrupt. I normally complain about books with insufficient denouement. However, the more that I think about it, I'm not sure how else the story could end. No denouement could improve the quality of the book. 

I'll explain my thinking using the 5 act format. The main plot of the book- the war- ended when the at the end of act 4. Act 5 was served to resolve side plots- making Act 5 functionally an entire act devoted to the function of release in tension and denouement. The abrupt ending at the end of act 5 worked because so much tension was let out of the text throughout act 5. There was no point in continuing the story after that point- there was no tension left to resolve. In context, I think the ending worked well. (Sorry, this is hard to talk about without spoilers.)

The book's stakes are well done, as was the tension.

**AUTHORIAL VOICE (TONE, PROSE AND THEME)**

I feel like I'm saying the same thing again and again. The book's tone was very 'comedy of manners' inspired, while the fighting was Regency Era Military Fiction inspired. I felt that the author successfully channeled these styles into the text. 

The book's themes of underhanded dealing, surviving setbacks and defeat, and the loss of innocence in warfare were well implemented, being woven into the story throughout the multiple plotlines and character arcs.

I do have a thematic complaint. The main plotline/theme was 'Republicans vs Monarchists.' The book needed to have a sympathetic republican character in the first half of the book, preferably back when Emily was still a civilian in act 1. The seed for the climax needs to be sown at the beginning of the book; as it stands, that seed is only sown at the midpoint climax when Emily is taken captive by the enemy republicans. The lack of that seed being sown early made the abrupt turn at the midpoint feel weird.

**SETTING, WORLDBUILDING AND ORIGINALITY** 

I feel like I'm saying the same thing again and again. This book successfully channeled the Regency Era back into fiction- even though this doesn't take place on Earth. 

If I had one complaint, though, it would be that we never got the origin story behind the 'magic system.' I would like to know how the kings got 'holy blood' which empowered the pyromancer warlocks. Are these people descendants of a god, or something? Even one or two sentences would have been enough to scratch my curiosity itch.

**AUDIOBOOK NOTES**

As stated above, the audiobook narrator really knocked this one out of the park. I have the feeling she has pre-experience with the genre of Regency Era stories, because she really brought it to life in a fantastic way. The narrator brought a 4 star book up to 4.5 stars for me.

**LESSONS LEARNED**

As an aspiring author, I try to derive lessons from the books I read. Here's what I learned from this one:

If you have a midpoint twist which changes the tenor of the book's plot and dramatically recontextualizes the book's characterization, foreshadow it. 

**SUMMARY**

While this book is not a full five stars (again, it was a bit bloated towards the middle), I do think this book is very good. I think I'm going to put it in the top 20 list of all the books I've ever read, and I've read 1000+ books. If the whole 'regency romance/military story' thing sounds interesting to you, read this.

[This is a re-read for me.](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/01/08/the-emperors-soul-book-review/) I'm re-reading it because it's excellent, even on this third (or fourth?) re-read. This time I really grew to admire Gaotona's character arc throughout. I also enjoyed the themes of: debating what a person's soul is; the value of an original versus an exact duplicate, and whether the duplicate can be of better value than the original; the ecstatic joy of the art of creation. I really can sympathize with Shai, and I think she's among the best realized of all of Sanderson's protagonists.

&#x200B;

[Elric of Melnibone book 1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30036.Elric_of_Melnibon_)

This is a fantasy classic, first published fifty years ago. This *feels* old, in both good and bad ways. The good is that the prose feels more lush and vital than *a lot* of modern stuff I read. The bad is *the cliched tropes*. This has everything from helpless fainting princesses, noble princes, evil cousins seeking to kill the king to inherit the kingdom... you get the idea. But here's the thing: I'm willing to forgive older books of these sins because these tropes became cliche as a result of how good books like just this one are, codifying those tropes. I had a few more quibbles, but nothing major.

While I read this, I can feel the lineage of older stories in it: this reminds me of some Conan stories, and other similar warrior-prince stories. While I read this, I can feel the lineage of *newer* stories derived from this: I can feel echoes of everything from D&D, Warcraft and anti-hero fiction like the modern grimdark wave. 

Credit where it's due, the prose here was good. This is an older book, and I must say that when I read older classics they usually have better prose than modern books. It feels that fantasy authors back in the day had to focus on their prose in order to get some respect for their books- a habit which has since faded in the modern fantasy tradition. Modern prose really doesn't hold a candle to what a lot of the old masters could do. Reading this book on a sentence-by-sentence level was lovely.

Did I enjoy this? Yes. Did it have it's flaws? Yes. It was only 180 pages (or just 4ish hours, in the case of the audiobook I listened to), meaning this didn't overstay it's welcome. I am willing to read more in this series, but I don't make it a very high priority.

  

[**Elder Race**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50663055-elder-race?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=4jmBsot2jY&rank=1)

This is a 5 star read for me. This is also the third story by Adrian Tchaikovsky I've read, and the third 5 star read for him. I am usually stingy when it comes to giving out 5 stars, so me giving this guy only 5 stars means *he's a really good author.* This is a short book, at only about 200 pages.

The conceit of this novel/novella is a sci fi/classic adventure fantasy fusion. 

Lyn is a rebellious princess who is not taken seriously by her family. She wants to prove herself in deeds of daring do. When she hears that a demon is destroying a nearby kingdom, she sets out to defeat it.

Nyr is an anthropologist from a future-tech Earth, sent to one of Earth's long abandoned space colonies to study how their society has advanced in the centuries since their separation. He is presently studying Lyn's civilization, while struggling with depression.

Lyn and Nyr must team up to defeat a 'demon.' Nyr, being a scientist, doesn't believe the demon is a supernatural force. Lyn, being from a medieval society, does believe in magic and the supernatural. They fight, with Nyr trying to convince Lyn about the truth of science vs magic... however he always fails because of the language barrier between them. Lyn literally doesn't have the words in her language to understand what he means. For example when Nyr says 'I am a scientist,' she hears 'I am a wizard.' The author's use of language drift was fantastic.

This book deals with the concept of depression very well. Nyr is VERY lonely. He's separated himself from the rest of society, for he is the only technologically advanced person on this planet for the last 300 years. He is forced to rely on a brain implant to control his emotions to prevent himself from succumbing to depressive episodes. Even then, it's not enough. Lyn must help Nyr push through his depression so they can slay the demon together.

Nyr's struggles with his depression, brought on by both loneliness as well as guilt about him being a 'bad' anthropologist. As an anthropologist, he should not assist the colony with their troubles, because they are 'inferior' culture which he should not 'infect' with his space culture. In the end he comes to realize that his aloof studying of the people of the colony was doing more harm than good, and he has to rejoin with humanity for not only his own mental wellbeing but also for their survival.

Lyn had a coming-of-age plotline, but with the twist of her gaining the respect of her family. Her story wasn't as nuanced or memorable as his, but it served the story well.

Overall, great book. You should read it. It's only 200 pages, so it's not much of a commitment.[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23947089-the-lost-metal?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=q1x1BTx0aH&rank=1)

Spoilers Below. As the saying goes, 'unasked for critique smells like three-day-old-fish.' It's easy for a reviewer to point out mistakes, but it's HARD for an author to avoid those mistakes. I'm writing this review in good faith, as one author reviewing another's book, trying to balance positives with negatives.

I've been looking forward to this book for a while. Mistborn Era 2 is my favorite of  Sanderson's works. This review will be for this novel as well as this sub-series in general.

**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE? WHAT GENRES? WHAT MAJOR TROPES?**

* Sanderson's Mega Fans. Like, seriously. This is a super-Cosmere book, and you need to read Mistborn Era 1, Mistborn Era 2, The Emperor's Soul, White Sand (I think), Stormlight + the novellas. There might be more, but I'm missing them.
* Fantasy Western
* Doomsday Thriller

**IF YOU ARE IN THE TARGET AUDIENCE, OR THE GENRES/TROPES SOUND INTERESTING TO YOU, SHOULD YOU READ THIS?**

Yes

**MY EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**/ **FUN FACTOR**

This book, and series, was fun. It had a strong western pulp vibe, where a cowboy hero must save the day in a lawless desolate land. I loved the characters, and side characters. I liked that it extrapolated upon the Mistborn magic system, using it in a limited, new way. It was an overall good story. 

Brandon Sanderson is an excellent storyteller. On a prose level, the story is very well written. Sanderson isn't an author who uses artful, 'pretty' prose style. Instead, his books are written to make the reader vanish into the text, suspending disbelief masterfully. The setting is beautifully created, and reinforced at every turn.

But this wasn't perfect. If I have a complaint, this book seemed a bit too obvious. The novel's twists and turns could be predicted. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it means the author properly foreshadowed the ending. But in this case, there really wasn't any unexpected last minute twists, taking a a fair bit of tension out of the story. Additionally, I thought the plotline of 'Wayne and Wax vs Dopplegangers' felt out of place.

Overall, I give this book's Emotional Resonance: (3.5/5 Stars)

I give this series (4/5 Stars)

Note: I default to giving 3 stars to good books. 3 stars for me is probably closer to 4 stars for someone else. 

**BIASES STATED**

To put this review/study in proper context, you must know my starting point.

I like reading Sanderson books. I'm not really a super fan, though. I haven't read all his books, and I don't like all of them.

**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**

A fantasy nuclear bomb is invented, and an evil god is intent on blowing it up in Wax's hometown. The heroes must stop it, using help from allies new and old, some allies coming from unexpected new places, and planets.

This book was executed very well. The author is a masterful storyteller. But like I said above, it was executed upon in an obvious way. There's a saying in storytelling circles: when you are trying to write a narrative twist, discard the first twist you come up with. The reason for this is because the first twist an author comes with is often obvious to the author, it's probably obvious to the reader too. So the author should discard the first twist they think up, and come up with a second twist, one more unexpected to both reader and author.

SPOILERS!

The twist in this novel is that Wayne dies in the twist ending. When concepting this novel, having a hero die in a twist ending is relatively common. However, the problem is that the narrative in this novel broadcasted Wayne's death a bit too much. The concept of this twist was fine, the execution upon the concept didn't work. I saw the twist coming, and it ruined my sense of tension. More on this in a later section. 

**CHARACTERS, CHARACTERIZATION AND DIALOG**

I liked, but didn't love Wax throughout this series. I think Wax was a bit boring in book 4; simply put, his personal growth arc ended in an earlier book when he resolved his emotional trauma associated with his ex-wife. The narrative tried to reboot his character arc with a new arc about 'Wax vs God,' but I-as-a-reader never became emotionally invested in Wax's antitheist plotline. *This is bad.* I love reading books about religion, and people losing faith in god. I am an easy sell for plotlines involving religion. So if I don't like Wax's antitheist plot-arc, chances are no one else will either.

I find Wayne to be a joy to read about. He's one of my favorite chaos monkeys in all of literature. I was a bit sad that he died, but it was clear by the end of this novel that he had no more character-growth to go through.  As an aspiring author myself, I understand that Sanderson was cashing in the check of 'Wayne' at this point. His death seemed like a good use of narrative resources for the sake of the Cosmere as a whole.

I loved Steris. She was a fun character, and absolutely unique. She took her propensity for planning for everything and used it to save the day. The nerd got to save the day by being a nerd, not by pretending to be an extrovert. A+++ character.

I enjoyed the return of Shai and Kelsier, and the introduction of new worldhoppers. Marasi's lovelife was an interesting turn of events, and I liked how it ended. I especially liked how Wayne left his wealth to the people he'd wronged in life, and got a statue with changeable hats. And finally, Harmony. For this series up until now, I didn't really get Harmony, and why he was so hands-off. I finally understand him. He shouldn't be called Harmony, he should be called Stagnation. Sazed ruins things by preserving them.

But, overall, book 4 wasn't a very character-forward novel. Some of Sanderson's books do more than others to really dig in deep into a character and find out more about them. The Stormlight books do a very good job of this, as an example. I can't say the same for this series. That's not a sin; there's a place for plot-forward books.

I do have one ‘flaw’ with the characterization, though. I just don’t get Autonomy's motivations, they seem counterproductive. If he’s supposed to exemplify autonomy, why then does he give other people power? Doesn’t sharing power with other people make those people dependent on him? Doesn't sharing power reduce his own autonomy? Nothing about that seems 'Autonomy' to me.

A true god of autonomy would encourage other people to be independent, even if it means they be independent from the god of autonomy himself. Case-in-point, at the end of this book Autonomy leaves a message saying that he is pleased that the people of Elendel defeated the nuclear bomb and he'll no longer attempt to slaughter them. Autonomy found this defeat pleasing, because by defeating the bomb they display autonomy from him. 

**PACING AND STRUCTURE**

I thought the book was fast paced. My suspension of disbelief  was maintained throughout, and I read it over the course of about two days. However, I wanted it to slow down a little. This was the last book in the series; I would have liked if it stopped to smell the roses a little more. 

I'm going to examine this book using the 5 act format.

* Act 1: The Status Quo  
   * In the Status Quo section, we are re-introduced to the heroes. Marasi and Wayne are now partners. Wax is happily married to Steris, and they have a young son. Wax is a politician, and we see him and Steris team up to unsuccessfully try to pass legislation. They fail to pass it because the Set stops them.
   * Wayne and Marasi uncover a secret group of Set criminals, who are using hemalurgic spikes to smuggle weapons. 
   * These Set schemes serve as the Inciting Incident, triggering Act 2
* Act 2: Challenge to the Status Quo  
   * In this section, the heroes go on the trail of the Set, teaming up to uncover the latest scheme the Set have come up with.
   * We're re-introduced to the mask-wearing foreigners.
   * The heroes receive a piece of Trellium metal from a defeated Set criminal. They do MAD SCIENCE!!! with the trellium, combining it with Harmonium, and discover the fact that it explodes violently.
   * This explosion triggers the end of Act 3. We now know the stakes; the Set have the potential to build a city-destroying bomb. This has to be stopped at all costs.
* Act 3: The Turning Point  
   * This is the bulk of the story, where the characters go on adventures, sleuthing through Elendel and beyond.
   * It begins with the revelation that the Set have the capacity to build a bomb, and this act ends with the initial confrontation between Wax and Telsin.
* Act 4: Escalation of the Challenge  
   * The heroes attack the Set's base in Bilming, hoping to defuse the Harmonium/Trellium bomb before it is too late.
   * The attack fails, with the reveal that the missile being built in Bilming was a fake all along. The bomb is being sent by boat.
* Act 5: Climax and Confusion  
   * The heroes return to Elendel, board the ship, and defuse the bomb. Wayne dies in the process. Steris uses her planning superpower to save the city.
   * There's a pleasant denouement afterwards, where the heroes mourn Wayne.

I think this book was well structured.

**PLOT, STAKES** **AND TENSION**

More about Wayne. The narrative used his death as a twist ending, in an attempt to provide the reader with an emotional gut-punch to wrap up the series. Unfortunately, it didn’t work (at least for me). The reason why is because the narrative broadcasted his death too much, by resolving his plotlines with a) the orphans b) his tragic backstory causing uncureable guilt and c) Me’Laan dumping him. Because Wayne was able to come to a conclusion with the orphans/the backstory/Me’Laan plotlines before his death, his death felt less impactful. In short, I knew his death was coming because Wayne had no loose threads left hanging; the author was deliberately setting him up to die. The tension suffered as a result.

This book would have been better if his death *hurt*. Imagine the pain the narrative would inflict upon the reader if, as an example, Wayne proposed to Me'Laan and they were engaged to get married. And then he died, before he got married. And then Me'Laan was there at the end of the novel, at the funeral, crying. That would have *hurt* to read. And that pain would have been *great*. It would have been one of the most emotionally evocative moments of the entire Cosmere.

In short, Sanderson pulled his punches. Sanderson isn't a grimdark author; perhaps he considered making Wayne's death more emotionally evocative, and decided to pull back on the emotional pain for the sake of making the book more family friendly. I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this, I can't second guess him. 

Anyway, going back to tension. The narrative was a bit too obvious planting 'Wayne's going to die' flags, at least for me. As a result, the tension suffered. I knew no one was in any danger until the end of the story, because Wayne was going to die performing a 'Heroic Last Stand.'

**AUTHORIAL VOICE (TONE, PROSE AND THEME)**

I've nothing really to say. This is a Sanderson book. If you've read a couple of his books, you pretty much know what his authorial style is like. 

Theme wise, I had a love-hate relationship with the doppleganger theme. Basically, Wax and Wayne were confronted with 'evil' versions of themselves. Functionally from a narrative perspective, the heroes fighting evil dopplegangers served the purpose of making the heroes confront the flaws in their own characters. In concept, this theme makes sense. Wayne in particular has a dark past, so making him confront his past in anthropomorphized form is good. By beating his dark copy, he proves he's risen above his dark past. 

In execution, this doppleganger plotline didn't work. Having Wayne and Fake-Wayne on screen together just struck me as being cringe. Like I said above, I like Wayne as a chaos monkey; however, two Waynes was *too* much chaos monkey energy going on at one time. I feel as though Wayne could have made resolutions for his dark past in another way. Additionally, the fact that they were actors, and not literal copies severely undercut the theme. I feel like Sanderson could have made the copies kandra who were literally dark echoes of Wax and Wayne's past selves, in possession of all their old memories and personalities. *That* would have accomplished the theme of 'Wayne rising above his past self' better.

**SETTING, WORLDBUILDING AND ORIGINALITY** 

The setting is the same as the other Mistborn Era 2 books, for better and for worse. The concept of this series is 'what if the Mistborn world progressed in technology from the feudal age until it reached the 1800's?' The series' genres are cowboy mysteries, using guns and mistborn magic to bring the law to Elendel and the Roughs. It's a fantastic use of genre and setting, where the heroes must prevent train robberies like a cowboy cop. I'm not really a fan of westerns, but I admit this played with the tropes well.

I have a complaint about this series. I find the gods in this series a bit lame. None of the gods feel numinous or mystical; they feel like rational human beings with superpowers. Going back to what I said above, I like stories about gods and religion; I should like these characters. But I don't. I don't know how to fix this; I think this is a personal taste sort of thing. 

On a related note, going back to my complaint about Wax's character arc above, Wax's crisis of faith didn't really work. He starts the book in a crisis of faith, and then gradually regains that faith. At the end of this book, Kelsier admits that he doesn’t trust divine Sazed because Sazed is transforming from Harmony into Discord. That should be an astonishing revelation, an admission that a god is fallible, and it should trigger a crisis of faith. 

I think Wax's 'crisis of faith' plotline would have evoked more emotions in the reader if Kelsier's revelation occurred at the beginning of the book. Wax would have a crisis of faith in response to learning that Harmony is becoming Discord. Eventually Wax chooses to put his faith in Harmony anyway despite this knowledge, at the end as an actual show of faith, despite knowing that Harmony is fallible. *That* would be a true leap of faith, trusting in a fallible god. 

**AUDIOBOOK NOTES**

I enjoyed the audiobook. Michael Kramer was the narrator, and he always does a reliable job.

**LESSONS LEARNED**

As an author, I want to improve my own writing/editing skills. To that end, I like to learn lessons from every story I read. Here's what I learned from this story:

&#x200B;

* Don't pull your emotional punches. If your protagonist dies after 4 novels, let me be sad. Pain is cathartic for the reader. I wasn't sad here, and I felt no catharsis.  
   * Wayne died in this book. Before he died, he resolved all his major plotlines *and* he also repeatedly stated that he felt unfixable guilt over the people he killed. Because Wayne both resolved those plotlines, as well as had unfixable trauma over his past, his death felt... empty, I guess. 
   * There is a trope that sad, traumatized people die. Writers sometimes use this trope as a way of telling the reader ""It's okay that this character died. They were damaged, and were never going to get better."" That happened here. Authors use the trope as a way of giving permission to the reader to not grieve. I don't really like the trope.
   * Additionally, Wayne had no loose threads going on before his death. If Wayne did have a few lose threads, his death would have left an unresolved feeling in the mind of the reader. That unresolved, niggling feeling would be more emotionally evocative for the reader.
* I like gods to be numinous, and mysterious.

**SUMMARY**

I enjoyed this. This was a good work of popcorn fiction, bringing back beloved characters from prior mistborn books, as well as a few worldhoppers. This was a good place to end the series, and good setting up the broadening of the Cosmere as a whole. The pieces are starting to come together, and I'm curious as to where this is all going.

punstersquared,2,8,"I recently celebrated 2 years with the most wonderful creature. I can't believe how time has flown. It seems like just last month that I was standing there gawking at the [tiny ball of fluff](https://i.imgur.com/iGbarQJ.jpg), this [perfectly formed Golden](https://i.imgur.com/kv9szuy.jpg) who had bounced into my life and quickly taken charge. Within weeks, he had figured out that his job was to teach me and take care of me, not just vice versa. 

The months flew by with [socialization](https://i.imgur.com/G0rayjY.jpg?1), [basic training](https://i.imgur.com/adKRMor.jpg), [body awareness](https://i.imgur.com/YBM7IJ6.jpg), [field trips](https://i.imgur.com/X88fOZr.jpg), and [introduction to retrieving.](https://i.imgur.com/5yNxYKw.jpg) Since he IS a Golden, sock negotiations also [featured heavily.](https://i.imgur.com/dKpXZrf.jpg)

We spent many, many hours practicing basic manners in a wide variety of settings, from [waiting patiently](https://i.imgur.com/qK43ydT.png) to [focus](https://i.imgur.com/zT7H7Sz.png) to [heeling outside](https://i.imgur.com/6QWCiSo.png?1). He also learned to [carry his own toys](https://i.imgur.com/qUnAMol.jpg), [pick up his leash](https://i.imgur.com/THxYEVe.jpg), and [pose for the camera](https://i.imgur.com/Flme6n1.jpg). His brief foray into [wheelchair driving](https://i.imgur.com/3Y2wV0D.jpg) didn't end well, however. Did I [mention](https://i.imgur.com/ADluhBC.jpg) the [waiting?](https://i.imgur.com/bmocaaO.jpg) As we weathered the storms of adolescence, he went on many [field trips with friends](https://i.imgur.com/FFFzpy2.jpg) to learn to work quietly around other dogs without losing his little teenage neuron. There were times when I despaired and thought he might never settle enough to ignore other dogs while working. He also had to relearn his recall multiple times.

With much practice and patience, though, he graduated to a big boy harness and we continued with [loose leash walking](https://i.imgur.com/i4F2oPD.jpg) and [settling.](https://i.imgur.com/ruwYuie.jpg) When he was fully grown, he learned to use that harness to help me get up and transfer to and from my wheelchair or balance for a few steps. He also learned to hit handicapped buttons.

Over the past few months, I realized that my [little teenage rascal](https://i.imgur.com/6BKOz0Z.png) was growing up. There was the day that I dropped my treat bag into the toilet at the medical center and he had to work for several hours without treats. The times that I had to trust him with his own leash so that I could park my wheelchair at the infusion center and I could tell that he thought about visiting the other patients but didn't. The time a doctor offered to take him for a minute and I couldn't well say no but held my breath as the two of them stepped away, then calmly returned. The busy days at the [farmer's market,](https://i.imgur.com/KIQEzFi.jpg) where he managed to keep his composure when a giant Malamute snuffled his back without warning and another dog yipped at us from under a table. There are still more tasks and tricks I'd like to teach him but that will always be the case and we've gotten to the point in our partnership, and my disability, where I genuinely need him along, where he takes care of his own behavior and takes care of me. Besides the trained tasks, he also worries over me and [fusses at me](https://i.imgur.com/SGZRmNc.jpg) if I'm not using my ventilator enough or I'm pushing myself too hard. 

Because of all this, on our 2 year anniversary the other week, I officially took the [""service dog in training""](https://i.imgur.com/vSkxdUE.jpg) tag off of his harness. I warned him that it can go back on if he decides to forget his training, but it seems that each week we become more of a polished team, weaving in and around shoppers seamlessly with the leash just an afterthought. Here he is chilling in Trader Joe's with his new harness [labeling scheme.](https://i.imgur.com/QwIAUFr.jpg) And, just because it's funny, the other day I caught him staring at some [finger puppets of body parts](https://i.imgur.com/kb2L0wb.jpg) that had fallen onto the floor. He thought they were just WRONG and needed to be picked up, though I politely disagreed. Sadly, even though he's a graduate Service Dawg, the [waiting never ends.](https://i.imgur.com/914YHHr.jpg)

Next task for me: find him a graduation hat to wear for stupid dog pictures. I did some clicker training with my last dog with good success but I am trying to really up my game as a trainer with my new pup, whom I'm hoping will be my service dog. We're doing all kinds of training and games while his little mind is pliable, including shaping and learning to offer behaviors. I taught him paw targeting the other week and have been working on nose targeting this week. When I transferred him from my hand to targeting a piece of tape on an object, he started using both his nose and his paw. Instead of waiting for him to touch the tape with both at the same time, I started clicking as soon as he put his nose towards the target. After a handful of repetitions, it actually worked and he stopped putting his paw up! This is the first time that I've really used a clicker to get that level of specificity and allow extinction of the unwanted behaviors in a dog who was offering them rapid-fire. Mind you, I'm still fairly rough and clumsy compared to real trainers, but I'm excited about reaching a new level. Onward and upward!

P.S. I have learned a TREMENDOUS amount from Sue Ailsby's site. I've been doing things a little haphazardly but we're going to start formally going through her training levels. http://sue-eh.ca/ 

Edit: Apparently I still can't follow directions about flair. No click/treat for me. :/I wanted to clear up some things for those who are new to the group and/or the service dog world. Here is a broad overview of the requirements to make a dog into a service dog who does public access with their handler. There are some training resources in the sidebar to the right and we are working on adding more.

Legally, the handler must have a disability and a SD needs to know ONE task that mitigates that disability. They must also be housetrained, non-aggressive, and under the control of the handler so that they are not disrupting the business. While many non-profits and owner trainers hold themselves to higher standards, this is the minimum standard set by the DOJ that allows the handler the right to access public places with their dog. Neither the states nor non-government entities can take away this right by insisting on higher standards.

In order to get there, training wise, there are several components. The training of these components can coexist at the same time and overlap in some cases.

- Socialization: During the period from 3 to 14 weeks of age, the dog is in their ""primary socialization period"" and learns who is OK and who is a stranger. The more types of people and types of animals you can put on their OK list, the better. This includes dogs of different breeds and sizes, as well as other species. This is a developmental window that closes and never reopens, but you can still influence the dog's OK list through positive experiences, desensitization, and counter-conditioning. If you adopt a dog who is older than 14 weeks, you will want to carefully assess their temperament to ensure that you are not acquiring a dog with pre-existing reactivity or fear.

- Habituation to a variety of life experiences: As with socialization, this is easier to do in a young puppy but can be done with an adult dog to a more limited degree. By life experiences, I mean everything non-living in the environment that a service dog will encounter, from hearing a variety of noises to walking on different surfaces to dealing with visually ""busy"" environments, like stores with lots of bright lights and reflective surfaces.

- Basic obedience/life skills: This comes under having the dog under the handler's control. For the safety of others as well as the dog itself, the dog should know how to walk calmly on a leash next to the handler; assume some sort of resting position when the handler is stopped for long periods of time; and display a high degree of impulse control around temptations such as dropped food, other people, and other dogs. There are a variety of ways to train these life skills and different handlers have different preferences for their dogs. 

- Task training: again, only one task (or 'work') is needed to make the dog a service dog. Many of us on here have the need for multiple tasks. The list of tasks must be individualized for the handler.

- Generalization: If the dog can pick up your keys at home, they are still a service dog. But if you take your dog out and about with you, they need to essentially relearn all of their basic life skills and task training in a variety of environments. Dogs are very good at picking up on environmental cues, but that means that a dog which understands ""down"" at home will need help learning that the word ""down"" means the same thing out next to the car, in the car, in the middle of a field, at the pet store, etc.

- Proofing: Proofing refers to making a behavior reliable under any circumstances. There are 4 D's of proofing: distance, duration, distraction, and difficulty. A dog which lies down when asked but only stays down for 5 seconds is a full time job for the handler, compared to a dog who will settle for 2 hours during a long meeting. When you are proofing a behavior, work on only one component at a time. If you increase the distance between yourself and the dog, do so in a low distraction environment. If you're in a high distraction environment, stay close to your dog and use a high rate of reinforcement.

- Polishing and putting it all together: As you progress with generalization and proofing, you can gradually move into more difficult, stressful environments. At this point, many of your dog's life skills should be habits, so that you're not constantly having to ask them to leave it or heel. The stronger your bond and the stronger the history of giving high value rewards for behaviors, the more you will be able to fade out the treats or toys and only give them intermittently, using praise and pets in between. Your dog should always get paid for their work but you won't have to constantly dole out treats forever as you transition from individual behaviors to behavior chains.

A common question is when to take the dog into public, non-pet-friendly situations, aka public access. This is dependent on state law, training style, personal preference, and the dog's progression in training. Many states do NOT give training rights in public spaces. You can still accomplish all your generalization and proofing in places like pet stores, parking lots, outdoor spaces at malls, etc. For those who do have training rights, care must be taken not to overface the puppy by rushing them into crowded places too soon, but it may be reasonable to do some of your generalization and proofing, or even habituation, in places where the dog will be working later, provided that the dog is housetrained.

Off topic: Since it comes up a lot and seems to be confusing, ADA is the law, the Americans with Disabilities Act. The DOJ, Department of Justice, is the federal agency which enforces your right to public access under the ADA. They have an ADA hotline that you can call but you're not calling the ADA itself, since the ADA is just a law.

By contrast, ADI is a non-profit organization, Assistance Dogs International. They have made standards for THEIR member organizations. These standards do NOT have any legal standing and do not affect owner trainers or organizations that are not members."

Why don't champion kits incorporate Summoner Spells? Why isn't there a champion that has, for example, the ability to double up on a single summoner spell (double ignite, double tp, double flash)? 

I'm not saying any of these are GOOD ideas, but at least they're ideas. Riot should be working with this one unique mechanic of their game, and thus far they just...aren't. Originally, Summoner spells were supposed to be separate from the champion (you know, we're the summoners and we're using them) but they scrapped that shit years ago. Hey all!

The goal of this is mostly to let people know that this board is coming Soon™, as well as gauge the general interest for the plates/cases as well as an additional feature I've been mulling over. On to the information! ~~For those of you that want to skip all the reading, the IC link is [here](https://goo.gl/forms/c7wcNFdH6tDSJiqj1).~~ The IC has been closed for like...forever. However, you're still welcome to check it out and comment with anything you'd like to see in the next revision or minor features you'd like added. 

#Layout

The layout is, as the title implies, a split 65% layout -- similar to what you would see from the Tada/Saber or, more accurately, the Ve.a or recent DeltaSplit.  All the key positions supported by the PCB can be seen in [this](http://imgur.com/P1SDIAg) image -- you can mix and match as you choose. However, the hybrid plate offering for both MX and Alps DSA Granite users (i.e. those who need Cherry stabilizers) will be [as seen here](http://imgur.com/9zhxgY5).

An Alps plate will be made as well based off the results of this IC -- either [Option 1](http://imgur.com/juFQiKW) or [Option 2](http://imgur.com/m7rctac). Regardless of actual production, plate files for the chosen layout will be made available to the community, as will the hybrid plate.

#Firmware 

Firmware will be fully programmable, a fork of the Let's Split QMK firmware. It will support RGB underglow, underglow layer indicators (courtesy of /u/glenpickle), and a firmware condition for having only one half connected (for those who, like me, will use the left half as a gaming pad).  

#Case/Plates

I am INCREDIBLY excited to announce that the case and plates are being designed by Edd of Smashing Acrylics (/u/smashtheplant). If you want to see his past work and current offerings, you can check his website [here](https://smashingacrylics.co.uk/). The composition of the case is going to be acrylic center (for underglow purposes) with ~~stainless steel~~ 5mm acrylic plates. The design will be left up to Edd's discretion, and ~~I hope you join me in looking forward to what he comes up with~~ it's incredible. No, seriously, go look up above! 

#Timeline

The [first prototypes](http://imgur.com/LL4XcQw) arrived last week, and I have already started on revisions for the second version. After the results of the interest check, I will finalize the design based on the results and order a final test batch. After that and Edd's finished his end of the design process, the group buy will begin. I will update with a more accurate ETA as we get closer to finalizing the designs, but the goal is to have the buy fulfilled by the end of 2017.

#Feature List

* Fully programmable
* Split 65% layout
* Case design by Edd of Smashing Acrylics
* Alps and MX Compatibility
* Underglow Compatibility (individually soldered or strip)
* Supports both PCB and plate mount switches
* Side independence: either side can be plugged in on its own and still function

#Interest Check

Last but not least, the actual [Interest Check](https://goo.gl/forms/c7wcNFdH6tDSJiqj1)! Alps users, make sure you fill this out to select what plate you'd prefer for your Alps-only plate!  Everyone else, I would appreciate it beyond belief if anyone interested would take the few minutes required to fill this out. Look forward to hearing from you all. I will be here answering questions indefinitely, so feel free to comment any questions you have. 

#UPDATE 7/26/2017

Unfortunately, split backspace will not be making it into this iteration of the Uruk. Next iteration may see that change, but for now it would be too much refactoring of the wiring to be feasible while keeping on my planned timeline. I apologize to those that were hoping for that change. Today I completed what should be all of the changes to the circuitry, so the firmware work will begin shortly if no mistakes are found. 

#UPDATE 8/3/2017

Got new prototypes yesterday and sent a semi-wired one off to Edd. Unfortunately, USPS first class international shipping's lead time is basically a giant question mark, so when it will get there is still up in the air. However, the good news is that the earlier alignment issues have been remedied, and the new footprints also support PCB mount Gateron switches, including Zealios. There will be yet another minor adjustment to make them slightly looser, as right now it's quite the tight fit to get them on. That said, once they're on they're on pretty damn tight, so maybe they'll stay. 

#UPDATE 8/7/2017

Slightly late update, but I'll be on vacation for the next week and won't have any equipment with me. Work will continue the moment I get back home, but until then there will not be any changes in board progress. This update will be deleted or modified when I return from vacation. 

#UPDATE 8/7/2017 \#2

So my laptop set on fire. No, I'm not joking -- I think a fuse blew. As it's my only working computer, the Uruk is on temporary hiatus until I get a new computer to use. Luckily (I guess) I am on vacation anyways so wasn't going to get work done yet.

#UPDATE 8/14/2017

Laptop still hosed, gonna need to replace it. In the meantime, I'm using someone else's laptop to work on the firmware, as the latest prototypes have no issues thus far (which is a plus). Will keep you all updated on the progress of the board, but it will be slow until I get my actual computing stuff back up and running. 

#UPDATE 8/21/2017

I have finally been able to get a copy of the Uruk files' latest revision off my old hard drive -- I had sent it to the laptop manufacturer because I was afraid of screwing anything up, and the files were sent to me on the 18th. Since then I have done a remapping of the pins for the right half to match the left so that firmware will be a whole lot easier. I spoke to Edd briefly about the cases, and news about those is a few weeks out at best -- I promise you will hear about it as soon as I do. I (mostly) wired up the current prototypes that I have, so if you're curious as to how that looks, check [this link](http://imgur.com/qXplfkJ). The dimensions and positions of the jacks are finalized unless there is a problem with how they interact with a case. The wires you see are way messier than need be, but I was going for speed over beauty so that I could start testing as soon as possible. 

#UPDATE 8/23/2017

New revisions of the PCBs have been ordered from EasyEDA. This includes new switch footprints with smaller, easier-to-solder pads and larger PCB mount holes (to better accommodate Zealios and Gaterons), an extra wire jump pad for a GND wire, support for surface mount TRRS jacks (which will be included alongside through-hole at no extra cost), and new wiring for the pins and columns. The new wiring will eliminate a step for the end-user when setting up the firmware for the first time. 

#mini update 8/29/2017

Well...the PCBs are still in production at EasyEDA. Not sure what the delay is, but hopefully I'll have actual progress news for you all next week -- this update is essentially just me saying I'm alive and still actively working on the project. 

#UPDATE 9/6/2017

PCBs are here, wired up, and firmware testing has begun. 

#UPDATE 9/15/2017

Not dead. Still working, an issue came up which is taking a while to resolve and troubleshoot. I apologize for the unexpected delay. 

#UPDATE 9/26/2017

New PCBs are here, 4th revision. Assembling them as quickly as possible, but I have a few exams coming up. Will update you guys hopefully at least once a week still, but work will be slower than it was initially. 

#UPDATE 9/29/2017

Well, I was assembling the prototypes during my free time in the days since they arrived, but I uhhh...well, I ran out of solder. Will update this when soldering is complete (a new spool should be arriving in a few hours), but first impressions are good -- all the alphas I have tested on both boards work perfectly. The SMD pads for the TRRS jacks aren't functioning properly (but through hole are), so I may end up axing that feature since the hybrid footprint seems to be more trouble than it's worth -- good flush cutters will do the job more than adequately for through-hole, and I will be linking a very nice cheap pair on the final GB page.

#UPDATE 10/1/2017

[Houston, we have a keyboard](https://imgur.com/Yfojkqs). Going to be doing some more testing and firmware refinement, but! Input works fully, and at least the left side RGB works flawlessly. Took a little doing on the firmware side and some help from others, but we got there. 

#BIRTHDAY UPDATE 10/2/2017

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME, I HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE WITH RGB UNDERGLOW ON BOTH SIDES. Gonna still need time to refine the firmware of course, but SO close to a finished product on the PCB end. Going to order some custom prototype cases as well. 

#UPDATE 10/23/17

I'm not dead and neither is the project, I swear. Just a lot of waiting as Edd finishes up the DeltaSplit project, which means there will be new protos with new edge cuts to better suit the case needs. No news beyond that since nothing has changed -- ordered some ribbon wire to see if it eases assembly any, and if it does it will be included in the kit (whereas before you would have to source your own wire). Price projections might be inaccurate, more news on that as the GB approaches. 

#UPDATE 11/5/17

Edd and I have discussed the case design, and I've made edge cut adjustments as appropriate. That particular batch is on its way to me as we speak, so hopefully it goes well. 

#UPDATE 11/13/17

I have received the new prototypes and will be building them soon. Well, I would, but...I have potentially good news. I was planning on keeping this under wraps until I could see if it would fall through, but I'm feeling uncharacteristically optimistic. I found a custom cable maker in China who may be able to mass manufacture the pigtails for the board. It might add a little bit of cost on my end (but probably none to you guys) while removing a ton of headache for y'all for assembly. It seems really promising, and I'm gonna be as disappointed as you guys if it doesn't work. We'll see.

#UPDATE 11/14/17

So, prices aren't gonna be feasible for the time being. Might come back to it later, but the MOQs are so high that I'd end up spending $100+ just to get a sample pack of cables, and I can't really afford that right now. Maybe for round 2, but definitely not for round 1 since the prices need to be low. 

#UPDATE 11/23/17

Sending PCBs to Edd tomorrow, still not sure if they're working. Ordered some potential replacement parts to make assembly easier which are still on their way. First glamour shots (old case) will be coming out next week since I will have SA Ashen by then. So that's nifty. 

#UPDATE 11/25/17

So uh...UPS wanted $90 to get it there tracked, or 50 untracked. Not happening. So I'll take care of it Monday when USPS opens back up. Sorry guys. Also to the few people who read these, are these helpful? **ALSO** I'd love to have feedback on transparency and frequency of updates -- do you not want me to update if there are no changes? Update once a week + every time something new happens (what I currently do)? Something else? Let me know.

#INSIGNIFICANT UPDATE 12/18/17

Not dead, we're still working on the case. [Here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/324924958415388675/388239709974822913/image.jpg?width=425&height=566)'s the first picture, and [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/324924958415388675/388239671978885121/image.jpg)'s another. Nothing is finalized, but updates were pretty slow so figured you guys would like to see at least something. 

#UPDATE 1/4/17

Hey y'all! Good news! I spoke with Edd after a suggestion by /u/bobbob9015, and he's confirmed that we will be able to have different colors available for the case! Woo!

#UPDATE 1/9/17

We have some wonderful new prototype pictures thanks to Edd -- case is coming along great, as I think you'll agree. They're at the top of the thread in the current status pictures. Excited to be launching soonish!

#UPDATE 1/16/18

Good news and bad news. Good news first! I have made a new revision of the PCBs that adds a resistor on the data line of the underglow LEDs. THIS WILL NOT AFFECT PRICE. It's for added security and safety since WS2812Bs are pretty easily messed up, the poor things. THE BAD NEWS. I'm currently undergoing medical treatment out of state, so will not be able to get any work done for the next 2 weeks. I apologize for the unexpected delay, but I hope you all understand that my health comes first for me. I will try to get some firmware work done while I am here (though admittedly that work will be few and far between). Hope everyone is doing well, and sorry again for the delay. 

#UPDATE 1/28/18

So my treatment got extended another week, so welcome back to update 2 of mixed news. Thanks to the wonderful and talented /u/bakingpy, there may be a way to not need to flash EEprom onto the board in order to tell the computer which side is which -- which means not only can you plug it in on either half with it properly recognizing which side is which, but you'll save a step in preparation. Which will be pretty great for everyone, since flashing Pro Micros is always a pain. I'm sorry to everyone for all the delays, but my life is kind of a mess right now -- and I want to deliver the best product possible for my first go. I hope you all understand, and to those who still read these updates I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for still being interested. 

#UPDATE 2/4/18 A.K.A. URUK:HOMECOMING

Okay so I'm back. About damn time, I can start working again. Ordering some parts for what will hopefully be the final prototypes, and the new firmware/pcb feature has been fully implemented in the final design. Doing some trace cleanup to make it look a little less hideous and ensuring there aren't any issues. Home stretch, guys. 

#UPDATE 2/11/18 A.K.A. THE ONE WHERE I FORGET INTERNATIONAL HOLIDAYS

So as some of you may know, Chinese New Year is right about now. What you may not know is that I use a Chinese PCB fabricator for all revisions of the PCBs, and as I just finished revising yesterday...well, we're waiting for a little bit. Bright side is that means more time to clean up firmware, I suppose, but really not the news I wanted to be sharing today.

#UPDATE 3/1/18 WHERE I RUN OUT OF CLEVER TITLES

So yeah. The PCBs literally just arrived yesterday. Won't have time for assembly until Sunday, and then testing will take the entire week after that bare minimum. There's one change I already know I need to make which is super simple -- I could probably leave it unchanged because it'd just mean you have to replug the keyboard every time you reflash, but...eh. Better to fix it.

#UPDATE 3/5/18 WHERE THE ELECTRIC COMPANY FUCKS ME

I didn't have power for over 30 hours this weekend. So. That wasn't great. Bright side, I did all the soldering today sans Micros, so tomorrow will be firmware flashing and testing. FWIW, I'm really sorry about all the delays -- uni courses are taking up a lot of my time nowadays. If you have any questions about the status, since this thread is archived, please don't hesitate to PM me -- I may not be the fastest designer, but transparency is one of my big goals with this project. There will be a new IC thread as soon as the testing concludes for this batch, and you can comment there to your heart's content -- Edd and I have been cooking up some ideas for additional options (mostly colors).

#UPDATE 3/26/18

So I wanted to wait until everything was done and keep it hush hush but I realized it's been 3 weeks since an update -- revision worked well, but I thought of a change to reduce the number of wires for the pigtail so I made the changes, ordered it, and the protos arrived today. Working on designing a site and setting up an LLC for the group buy as we speak. I won't make a new update when I check if the new protos work, just update this one. EDIT: didn't work how I thought it would but I have fixed it. 

#UPDATE 4/9/18

Haven't had much time recently, hope you all can understand. I was preparing for a gig for ESL that's coming up this weekend, so the practicing and planning has taken up most of the free time that my homework hasn't eaten. Work is still continuing, and I will return to my slightly-faster-than-the-approach-of-the-heat-death-of-the-universe pace within the next week, but I wouldn't expect an update until about the 17th. That may change if I get more done than I expect, however. 

#UPDATE 5/8/18

SO uhhh life is kind of crazy right now. Until exams are over and I'm back home there won't be any progress made because I need to prioritize my life stuff for a bit. Will continue after that point (late May) but until then don't expect anything. Sorry for keeping y'all in the dark accidentally. 

#UPDATE 6/28/18

I know these are going to register as empty words, and I'm sorry for that. I've been neglecting the Uruk as of late because of my other work being a higher priority, and that's not fair to you guys. I've taken some significant steps towards finishing the business end of things in preparation for launch, and have finalized the design. It's not perfect, but I know you all would rather have a working product that isn't exactly what I envisioned rather than no product at all. Again -- these words don't mean much, but hopefully the second IC will. Thank you all for your continued patience, I cannot express how much I appreciate it. 

#UPDATE 7/6/18: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH

So while I was setting up the website and getting all the back end stuff done, I found out that unfortunately Edd will no longer be able to manufacture the cases due to circumstances out of both of our control. I now have the task of finding a manufacturer I trust to cut the cases and make adjustments as necessary. I sincerely apologize for yet another delay.This is going to be a bit of a long-winded post, just because I'm so interested in the champion. She seemed pretty cool when I played her yesterday, and I think she has niche viability. However...her builds seem to be all over the place. The pros go with the trinity of IBG, BC, and Maw, whereas many Illaoi mains prefer Death's Dance to be somewhere in the build. Which is better, and in which situations?

P.S.: Why does everybody say she's trash, she's pretty fun and does decent damage -- she's just not a great tank.It has about 5% of the subscribers the main ToS subreddit has and would be a much more useful resource if only there were just more people there.

I understand you're excited about getting it, I was too when I got mine, but let's be honest with ourselves here and admit that this does not contribute anything to the subreddit by announcing it in a post.

Can we make a new subreddit or mega/weekly thread or something for the massive amount of ""got my card"" posts?

Edit: lol at people getting offended because of my opinion or assuming I'm upset or mad or butthurt about something, in reality you guys are putting more thought into this so far than I have, I just made the thread and then went to work.First off let me say I personally hold CRO in my portfolio as my biggest bag so I am in a position where CRO's growth and success will bring me personal gain (my personal goal is to upgrade to Icy White) so I am biased yada yada and all that. I am not a financial advisor but if you must know, I did graduate high school which means I am able to do math using a calculator. Math is not as biased as I am, but you are welcome to check my work, I appreciate correcting any mistakes.

For this I am using $1100 as the average monthly spending because that's what a quick internet search said was the average for rent USA in 2020, this is $13,200 per year. Reality is more expensive than this but for the sake of keeping reasonable expectations I will just use that for the math as a baseline. I am also not accounting for any CRO price fluctuations because the rebates and cashback spending are scaled based on spending USD amounts using the card.

**Ruby:** $400 in CRO

- 0% card stake interest
- 2% cashback: $22 per month or $264/year
- Spotify: $12.99 per month or $155.88/year

- Airport lounge access for Jade/Indigo, Icy/Rose and Obsidian
- 10% rebate for Expedia for Icy/Rose and Obsidian
- 10% rebate for Airbnb for Obsidian

**Conclusion:**

With so many marketing partnerships involving multi-year contracts that extend across a range up to 20 years I can imagine this company continuing to existing for a very long time. Staking to get a CRO card isn't like normal investing where you don't get any returns until you eventually cash out either, instead you are getting interest paid out every week and monthly rebates on a consistant basis while using a cool stainless steel debit card. 180 days after staking if the value of CRO has gone up you can re-stake to pull out the extra CRO if you want to and if the value has gone down you can just keep it staked without losing the card tier benefits. If you use the card long enough in theory it should always pay for itself after a certain amount of time assuming that Crypto.com doesn't start removing incentives. 

Only stake what you can afford to lock down for atleast a long enough time frame that you eventually reach the breakeven point, or consider the return of investment percentage and compare that to the staking yields that you get with other cryptocurrencies.

Edit #1: Added ROI percentagesBeen dry since 4/20 so I decided to get drunk to give me an idea of why people like to drink so much. I enjoyed myself but it's the morning after now and my body is all like ""Dude, fuck your shit, man.""

Alcohol feels foreign to my body while cannabis feels so much more natural, the difference is huge. We have receptors designed for THC, so when you're high your body is still 'working as intended'. With alcohol it's like throwing a wrench into the mechanics of your body, things stop working properly.

Cannabis will forever be my drug of choice, any other ents feel the same way?
Didn't even smoke, just ate two brownies. At some point after the second brownie started kicking in I said this to one of my friends, ""All life worships me but I am not God, I am the universe, You are the universe. We are but the universe observing and perceiving itself, take a moment to look at the stars and admire your own beauty.""

I was blown away by this at the time."

     **Link to the trade thread/comment**: [blank]There's a lot of stuff going on right now and I know it can be hard to keep up, so I'm going to be doing **my best** at giving a simple rundown on the situation for anyone interested. This thread will *not* include my own thoughts on the situation, I'm doing my best to give unbiased information so that everyone can formulate their own opinions. 


&nbsp;


Kerupt, Akenro, Dooble and King_Wizard played for a team called Cypher in the RLCS qualifiers, and ended up making RLRS. They were then picked up by Naventic Esports to play in the RLRS season. Recently, Akenro spoke to an RLCS admin (It is assumed to be cloudfuel) about a  rule-break by his own team in the play-ins. Akenro admitted to the RLCS admin that his team used an illegal sub during the play-ins. Atomic, an underage (14) and unregistered player, supposedly played *on* Dooble's account during the play-ins. This would obviously break two major rules in RLCS: 

- Atomic is not of age to play RLCS

- Atomic was not on Cypher's roster

At this point, the statement above is *fact*, considering Akenro, Dooble, Atomic and Kerupt have all made tweets essentially confirming the situation. 

[Akenro's statement on the situation](https://twitter.com/Akenro/status/910333639531081728)

[Kerrupt's statment on the situation](https://twitter.com/Kerupttt/status/910273713987342336)

[Dooble essentially confirming the situation](https://twitter.com/Dooble124/status/910266180547395584)

[Atomic essentially confirming he did play](https://twitter.com/AtomiccRL/status/910320742197231616)


What we know so far is that they **did** break the rules on several counts. After this information was released about the situation, it turned into speculation about the punishment being carried out to the players. There is debate about who is guilty and what price they should pay. We do know that since the admins of RLCS/RLRS had been notified, the team has been [released from the Naventic Org](https://twitter.com/Naventic/status/910217123041087488) and we can assume based of off Keruptt's twitter bio (""rlrs player banned until further notice"") that the team has been banned from RLRS. 


&nbsp;


#Why does this matter?


The main things that people are wondering is:

- Will another spot be reopened for RLRS? Who will play for it?

- Who will be punished? 

- What severity will this punishment be


**Final notes for context**

Kerupt is an infamous booster, so many people believe he may received an even harsher punishment as he has been breaking the rules for a while. Atomic is also on the line as he is a great player and people are wondering whether he will be able to play in any RLRS/RLCS events when he is 15. 




**Sorry for bad formatting, I'm tired. If I'm missing any important information or if any of my information is wrong, please private message me.**

So we've heard a lot about how people hate playing people much higher than them and losing. This is also a problem on the other side. I'm a champ 3 in 2s right now and sometimes I queue against a champ 1 and diamond 3. Now if I win this match, which i most likely will, i'll gain 3 or 4 MMR, which is almost useless, but on the off-chance I lose, I can lose up to 18 MMR which happened to me yesterday. It's annoying for both people. I want to queue against people my own rank.These Rocket League Youtubers **must be stopped**.

&nbsp;


I see this trend going around for some Rocket League Youtubers, and I'm not talking about the pros, I'm talking more about the clickbait red arrow free white zombas Youtubers. The trend is this whole ""Scamming a scammer"" thing. 

Here is a **prime** example (Ensure your adblock is enabled for the follow video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQkAnoItg0Q


&nbsp;

In this video, Youtuber ***EazyMizy*** scams a scammer for a striker heatwave. He tests out whether the guy is a scammer first and then he supposedly uses his own name to scam him. 




*What's the problem? The scammer guy is an asshole!*


**Of course** the scammer is an asshole. I spent months on here dealing with them day in and day out. I couldn't agree more. THe problem is that this Youtuber is scamming someone for his own personal gain, in this sense, to gain following on social media. He supposedly gives away whatever he scams, but only if you ***LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE*** which helps him. Essentially, he's doing exactly what a scammer does. Taking someone's item for his own personal gain. 


&nbsp;

I'll draw a comparison here. I know a guy who stole a phone from someone. I meet up with said guy and steal his phone. Then I go to school and tell every kid that they can get this shiny phone for free if they follow me on instagram. I repeat this process until I am instagram famous and making bags of cash, all from stolen items.

*Before anyone calls me out, I know EazyMizy isn't making bags of cash, but he does profit from this.*

The point is that  what they are doing is just as bad as scamming. It's bullshit and shouldn't be tolerated, much less rewarded. 



&nbsp;


**Sincerely,**


***A pissed off former trade staff member***
Unfortunately, it feels like I *have* to make this post, and it's about one of the worst parts of gaming as a whole.

&nbsp;

This is mainly an issue on PS4 and Xbox from what I've seen, but I'm sure I could be wrong. 

I'll just go ahead and say it, we need to talk about IP logging and DDoSing. 

&nbsp;

Now, some of you won't know what that is, and that's completely fine. I'll put it in my short little definitions but I'll also link to the wikipedia pages of each.

[IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP)- Internet Protocol, each system has it's own IP, your Xbox, Pc, Ps4, phone, internet router.

[DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)- Distributed Denial of Service. An attack on a device (in this context an internet router or provider) that renders your internet useless for a given amount of time.

&nbsp;

Now, what does this have to do at all with trading? Well, unfortunately,  people are using these scummy services and techniques to blackmail people into trading, booting people they don't like offline, and just scaring people. 

Now, in order for these people to do anything to you, they have to have your IP. Unfortunately, there are a couple of ways they can do this.

- Being in a party chat on PS4 or Xbox

- Sending you a bait link that you click.

If I'm missing any important methods of getting IP addresses, please let me know.

&nbsp;

Once they have your IP address, they can also do a number of things.

- ""Boot"" you offline using the mentioned DDoS attack.

- Get personal information (General Location, maybe a name)

- In serious cases, people have found house addresses (though it is unlikely)

All these things can be used to force you to do things for them, I've seen many instances where people ask for items, ask not be exposed after they've been scammed and have even just done it because someone rejected their offer or they didn't like them.

&nbsp;

Moving on, what can you do to **avoid** someone getting your IP address?

- On PS4 and Xbox, don't just join random parties, especially on PS4, be careful on community parties.

- Don't open random links. Especially links that don't end with .com 

- Report anyone who sends a fishy link to the moderators immediately. 

&nbsp;

But what if they **already have** your IP?

- First of all, don't panic. This is the internet, chances are it's just a sad kid trying to be cool.

- Call your internet service provider and ask for an IP change.

- Report them to the moderators immediately.

&nbsp;

Thanks to a nice (anonymous) trade central member for some of the info provided :)

&nbsp;

I'm sorry if this post isn't relevant to you, but it's good to be educated, I also know there are kids who trade and they are vulnerable. Remember, mods are here to help, if you ever don't know what to do, shoot us a message.

Thanks everyone,

My gt to get it started: 

pagit85Hi guys 
So currently I'm using the santander 123 and it's going well so far. I was also thinking maybe it would be worthwhile getting the 2 potential TSB accounts too (1 single 1 joint) and simple putting the full 2k in each then setting up standing orders to cover the 500 in clause then sending it back again. 
I'm not sure how this will affect my credit rating over the next year or so though. I know it leaves s footprint for the initial search, but will it do anything else like make it go down or up etc.. 

Would anything else be better? Fwiw my partner who I'd have the account with has perfectly fine credit rating, we tried the free trial of that experian checker a few weeks ago and it was easily in the green.So someone at my place is leaving, and I've been asked to do some of their job. Ok fine, but, they are paid a decent amount more than me. The company aren't advertising the job as there isn't going to be a new position, I'm just going to pick up most of the work. What's the best way I can approach getting a pay rise? After agreeing, the person leaving has since told me that what I'm doing will basically be all of their job.IGN: Rich

Orig_analUse_rname,7,6,"[removed][removed]They revolted in Haiti. I'm sure slaves revolted elsewhere. Read American Slave literature. There were hundreds if not thousands of slaves that **enjoyed** being slaves. Don't know if it's Stockholm Syndrome but the fact remains. They ratted out other slaves trying to escape. House negros, uncle Toms. The slave masters played them against one another. You can see it today with black men who don't want to go to jail but feel pressure to be thugs (Which rapper fought against that, again?). Yes racism is real. Yes white privilege is real. Yes white supremists are everywhere you go. But at a certain point they needed to be willing to fight, even at the risk of death. Even at the risk of torture. But they weren't. 

If slavery wasn't a choice then who was Harriet Tubman? What was the Underground Railroad? The slaves who didn't *try* did so by choice. 400 years of slavery but only decades of Jim Crow? What made Jim Crow end so quickly? Could it be that we were sick of the bullshit and actually *retaliated*?"

It's hard to explain because i dont completely understand the design pattern(s) I'm seeing, but instead of coding out a function for an endpoint I see people creating a list of all of the function names as strings and with this they generate all of the endpoints on the fly. Here is a quick sample i found on github: 
https://github.com/stylight/python-wordpress-json/blob/master/wordpress_json/__init__.py

Is there any guide that discusses this type of style for writing an API wrapper? Im not too sure what to search forI'm considering purchasing them from Alibaba, but I would also be interested in learning alternative methods of finding quality manufacturers overseas.

I'm sure there are some good ones I have no clue about."

jayrocs,1,1,"Hi r/slowcooking,

I need help. So I bought a new 6 quart crock pot about a month ago and I've used it 3 times already. These pictures are similar to what the stains look like.

http://www.chow.com/uploads/1/0/9/549901_hb_slow_cooker_finish_flash.jpg

http://www.chow.com/uploads/4/9/8/549894_hb_slow_cooker_finish.jpg

Those are not my pictures but my crock pot has been recently wiped with olive oil and I'm letting it sit before I clean it again. I noticed these stains after the very first time I used it. I am wondering maybe it's from my cleaning method? 

**This is how I've cleaned it every time:**

* I let it soak in water overnight

* Wash it the next day

* Sit it upside down on a towel 

So i tried looking up reasons why and I came across a tutorial for cleaning water spots and mineral deposits. Can anyone confirm that these are either mineral deposits or simply water spots? I find it weird that after one use I started seeing these weird spots and very disappointed, actually. Also, did they appear because of the way I cleaned it, or do these just happen naturally? I have a white crock pot as well, so I can't really compare because I wouldn't be able to see the spots on that one.

bit_nothing,5,6,"I returned from my trip to New York last week so I've had some time to reflect on my trip. Firstly I'd like to say a huge thank you to the people of this Sub and other related NYC subs.


I thoroughly enjoyed my trip and wish I could stay for longer.


My first fear was the airport, being an Asian Muslim donning a beard (albeit a British national) I felt a little intimidated based on stories I hear and to add to that I was landing at EWR (Newark) which doesn't have the greatest of reputations. I must admit the people at the airport were charming, I was in and out in a flash. The guy at immigration was such a nice bloke who wished me well on my visit.

On return to England the first question the vast majority of people asked me was how was the airports and honestly it was crazy to see the shock on their faces when I told them it was so easy and hassle free. I had this preconceived idea that I'll be treated like a second class citizen but I'm glad that fear was quickly rubbished.


Quite honestly I don't think I came across any rude or unwilling to help people and for that im hugely thankful.



I guess my favourate bit of the trip was walking around and stumbling acorss things. The most surprising would probably be how peaceful soccer matches are. I went to go watch NYCFC vs New England and hadly saw a cop or steward, it felt like a family friendly atmosphere unlike England where majority of the chants include profanity.



I wish someone told me how big the MET museum was... My god it was big I don't think I got the time to appreciate everything in there but it was great to see history from around the world.



I guess I want to say thanks for all the tips and advice on this sub but also putting up with us tourists.. I work in central london and we have a shit tonne of tourists so I know what its like to be the local.

Thank you,

A very happy Brit!As we know the rewards are fixed for weekly objectives could we get a sticky post with rewards.

voodooxlady,5,2,"My parents decided to have a kid when I was ten years old. And for the last ten years all I remember is raising her. Waking up in the middle of the night to feed her, having to babysit her for YEARS. I wasn't allowed to go out because I was stuck babysitting her. It was so bad I would have to go to school late because I ha to get up, get her ready for school and drop her off. I couldn't stay late after school because I had to pick her up. Weekends were non existent. If I had a party or wanted to hang out with friends I had to make sure I wasn't on babysitting duty (which I was.) I would have to beg my mother to please come home so I could make it out to whatever I planned. During the summer while my mom wasn't working she FORCed me to bring my younger sister I the park everyday. And if I brought her home too early I had to go back. I could honestly go on and on but raising my sister was very traumatic for me. It's the exact reason why I don't want children of my own. But nobody understands this. Not my mom, sisters or even boyfriend. ""That was your sister. Your own kid is different."" UM HOW???

Sorry for the rant just needed to get it off my chest. Do you have any underlying reason?Well we do kids eat free but it’s like a buy one get one off thing. Buy a full priced entree and they will get a kids meal from the kids menu FREE. It says it clearly on the menu too. This table ordered a kids meal and 3 things off our happy hour menu. So I told him about the kids eat free and if he wants I can charge him for the burger full price and take off the one kids meal. He was like wow I didn’t even know about this let’s do it. I drop off his check and he comes up to me and asks me what’s the age limit. I say 12 and under. So he’s all like well I should get two kids discounts then. So I explained very nicely that it’s only the kids meals are free from the kids menu. He got soooo hostile talking about how he’s never heard that before. Kids eating free only off the kids menu? Huh never heard that before. Like wtf ? You never heard we had kids eat free before either until I told you.


And then he stiffed me. Lol I’ve been thinking about it all day I just wanted to vent. The entitlement of guests when they hear kids eat free is INSANE. I hate it and can’t wait until we get rid of it. It’s very clear on the menu that it’s kids 12 and under free meal from kids menu with a purchase of a full priced entree. The arguments we’ve had because people want to buy from our happy hour menu and still get the food free because we didn’t tell them, or buy the kids meal for themselves or people who clearly aren’t adults and people like that douche bag. Ridiculous.My job ridiculously comps them or gives them something else. I think it’s fcking insane and unfortunately I was taught to just apologize and offer those options? But in what world when you choose something and you don’t like it you just get to magically act like you never ordered it? So what do you tell em? I truly love for rejecting customers ridiculous requests but I need to learn how to eloquently do it.I love this sub and I love complaining about guests so here's another story....a few weeks ago towards the end of my shift two women come in. I hear one of my coworkers groan and say they're really cheap and irritating. Of course they end up being my table. Onto their order, the younger lady points to our caesar salad. It's just a salad and unfortunately we charge to add a protein. So I ask her if she'd like to add one. She's all shocked like ""what that costs extra?"" And I say yes and point to the menu where it says ""salad add ons."" Yes I know it's a RIP off but there's nothing I can do. She tells me that we don't charge, they come here all the time, she's never gotten charged for chicken for her salad. I politely explain that we have to because the cooks will not make it if it was charged in the POS. She insists she was there last night and one of the servers didn't charge her. I again explain not possible and here's why. The server who took care of her the previous night was on shift, so she slams the menu down and goes ""I want to speak to him because clearly you're new here."" Normally I try and kill them with kindness but I was shocked. ""Excuse me miss what was that?"" And she repeated ""you're obviously new here I want to speak to him."" 


So I clear my throat and said ""Actually ma'am I opened this store 3 years ago and have been here the entire time and I am a server trainer and I've actually been here longer than he has. But I'll go get him =]""

And he proceeded to explain that he did charge them while I stood right next to him. 

Oh and she apologized for the trouble but not to me, to a hostess that I made take her order because I refused to take care of her anymore after she said the other server who corrected her was the only helpful person in the store.

I still think about this incident to this day.../endrantAnd I tried to shrug it off. One of them was my manager (a guy). He said ""why is she slim and you're fat?"" And I responded fuck you. And the other was a female dishwasher who doesn't speak much English. And she managed to say ""she's skinny, you fat."" Having someone say it a second time...I feel annoyed and a little sad. It's always been she's the skinnier one and I'm the fat one. I've heard it my whole life. And I've gotten kind of used to it.

Just a quick edit - YA I'm insecure about my weight obviously that's why it bothered me. They didn't say fat in an endearing or ""nice"" or comparative way (you can just say someone is bigger. Fat is an insult when describing some one. Atleast to me. So what if it's true. I was never raised to go around calling people fat.) My manager actually continue to tease me by asking if I steal her food and whatnot. And I have no I'll will towards my sister or feel the need to compete. We're both grown adults and I'm happy to be working with her. Everyone's comments about our weight is what makes it uncomfortable.For some reason the busiest craziest holidays i make NO money and i BUST my ass. 3 seperate tables stiffed me in a row. One of them an 80$ check because she ordered two 14.99 breakfasts and thought they were 7.99 because she misread (or has no idea wtf a la carte means). On days like these i give my best service which i usually do regardless and I dont even have a huge section so I'm on top of my tables. I just feel so defeated right now.  Been here since 9 and made 70$ while my coworker is bragging about the 100$ she just made in 30 mins. Sorry for the rant I just neexed to let it out...How much validation do you truly need to have ONLY me sing to you?"

lheritier1789,8,6,"Due to work schedule I've always primarily pugged every legion raid. Early on during the learning runs on release I mostly filled in groups where most of the people were from a guild and just needed an extra or two. And they always just siderealed... I probably should have volunteered for some runs but it felt scary when I was always the rando pug. Well now we all have titles and are expected to know the runs... I just live in anxiety for the day when I'm given lead at the end of Vykas g3 or something and have no idea how to aim Wei 😭 I barely even remember the actual keyboard short cuts.

Technically I have finished off some ghost Valtans with Thirain but I don't think it's physically possible to miss that one.

Anyone with tips would be welcome lol

Edit: thanks guys for the tips and encouragement. Pls don't yell at me next time I volunteer to try in one of your lobbies and fail ❤️"

fullforce098,2,1,"My boyfriend and I just finished the series finale to Bojack Horseman. Without spoiling anything, it gets emotional, as you should expect from that show. The ending, specifically the final moments, are designed in such a way to leave the viewer sitting in silence and ruminating on the events and the message, while a great song plays, leading you into the credits. You're supposed to just let it all wash over you, and come down from the experience of the finale and the show as a whole. It's beautiful and poignant, we were tearing up for fucks sake.

Except the *second* it cuts to black, here's [Netflix with some new series it feels it needs to force-feed me and that God damn countdown begins to stop the autoplaying](https://i.imgur.com/mZhIrME.jpg)

You know what a fucking countdown does when your just trying to come down from the emotions of a show? It upends them with panic as you scramble to find the damn remote or controller top stop the autoplaying. Often times your PS4 controller has gone to sleep and you need to reconnect it first, or you just can't find the remote in time, or you accidentally back out of the episode all together instead of hitting the Watch Credits option which they make it absurdly easy to do.

It's aggravating, it's anxiety inducing, and it is absolutely and unequivocally *unnecessary*. I've never had an experience where the ending to a show has had the mood so utterly spoiled by this shit as it was here. My boyfriend and I should have been sitting there coming down from an amazing experience, instead we were angry and annoyed because Netflix can't wait 60 fucking seconds before forcing some new show on us.

Netflix: let the fucking credits play!!I'm seeing a lot of people not understanding what going on with Bran so let's clarify:

Bran's head has been overloaded. The Three-Eyed Raven stated quite explicitly that Bran was not ready for this,  but due to Bran's dumb childish move, he now has to take on the history of the world as an unprepared teenager.

>Three-Eyed Raven: It is time for you to become me.

>Bran: Am I ready?

>Three-Eyed Raven: **No.**

After the Three-Eyed Raven's death, just before Bran and Mera got to the Wall, Bran crawls toward the Weirwood.

Mera asks
>""Are you sure you’re ready for this?""

Bran responds
>""I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now. **I have to be ready for this.**""

He then wargs into the tree and we see the R + L = J reveal.

THAT was the moment it happened, that was the point where Bran didn't just look into the past, he took the past into him. He opened his mind to the flow of information and history coming from the Weirwood trees. That's why Bran didn't act weird during the scenes prior because he has not yet taken the big leap and let it all happen. Mera and Bran knew it would happen, that's why Mera asked him if he was ready.

And it's fucking him up because he **wasn't ready**. He has a constant stream of information pouring into his head, and it's addled him. He isn't behaving like normal because he isn't himself right now. He's discombobulated, spitting out information when something triggers a memory he's downloaded because that's all he can think to do.

He met Dolorous Edd, so all the events regarding Edd that he'd downloaded from the tree came streaming to the forefront of his mind, but he can't process it all so he just recited them aloud. Sansa spoke to him in the Godswood, so he remembered the last time she was in the Godswood and spoke about it aloud. He didn't mean to hurt Sansa, he just isn't thinking clearly. He's vocalizing his internal thoughts, not aware of what he's doing. Not unlike someone who has been concussed.

Cut the guy some slack, he's been through hell, and he's taken on an incredible burden he doesn't know how to handle yet.      

**Edit:** [Isaac Hempstead Wright himself said in an interview about Bran and Sansa's reunion:](https://winteriscoming.net/2017/07/31/isaac-hempstead-wright-bran-sansa-stark-reunion/)

>""It’s like imagining you have all of space and time in your head. Bran is existing in thousands of planes of existence at any one time. So it’s quite difficult for Bran to have any kind of semblance of personality anymore because he’s really like a giant computer""

>“Bran really at this stage is not the Three-Eyed Raven. He’s got the title but hasn’t had thousands of years of sitting in a cave looking through time. Somebody put in front of him a massive encyclopedia of all of time and he’s only opened page one. He can look stuff up but doesn’t have this all-knowing all-seeing capability just yet.”

[Also, Davin Beinoff has said](http://ew.com/tv/2017/07/30/game-of-thrones-bran-stark-reunion/):

>“There was supposed to be more time to learn what he needed to know and they ran out of time. Now Bran the Broken is broken in more ways than one. He’s got serious challenges dealing with all the stuff happening in his mind and that prevents him becoming this omniscient character.”The Muppets seem to be once again fading into obscurity. 

The 2011 revival with The Muppets returned them to the spotlight briefly but Muppets Most Wanted, while good, didn't seem to draw audiences and the momentum started to putter out. The ABC show was cancelled before it could really find its footing, and then the Henson Company spent an exorbitant amount of time and energy on The Happytime Murders which was just a train wreck.

So where do the Muppets go from here if they want to stay relevant? I say they need to go back to the 90s.

The audiences that grew up with the original Muppet Trilogy and the Muppet Show are not the only audiences anymore. Millennials are more likely to have fond memories of Muppet Christmas Carol and Muppet Treasure Island because those were the Muppet movies we were familiar with.

Also, one of the best things about the Muppets to me has always been the way they get billed as themselves. The Muppet Christmas Carol marketing lists ""Micheal Cain, Kermit the Frog, Gonzo the Great"" etc. I always thought that was such a neat idea. These aren't just characters, the Henson Company goes out of the way to make them feel consistently real off-camera. They appear as guests on talk shows, they show up as themselves on SNL, everyone speaks of them as if they are any other celebrity. I think they should lean into that more.

So start doing more adaptations again. Have a star as the main character, another as the main antagonist, then use the Muppets ""as actors"" to fill out the rest of the cast and ""Muppetize"" the story. I feel like that sort of sillyness is something audiences will be more receptive too right now than attempts to tell more modern day Muppet stories.

What did you guys think?I used to really love Flash. It was my favorite show on the air, I tuned in every week really excited. But now this show is barely a fraction of what it once was, and we all know why:

Hartley has ruined this fucking show.

I liked Hartley to start with. He was witty, he was useful, I liked how he was a good foil for Cisco. But right around that episode in season 1 where the Barry from the future shows up being chased by a time wraith, it all started going downhill. There was more and more Hartley in every episode and now Flash is playing second fiddle to this secondary character IN HIS OWN SHOW.

I thought this last episode had promise, there was not much Hartley, it was going good trying to catch this time wraith, then at the end when the day needs saving WHO THE FUCK COMES IN?? HARTLEY. Flash can't do a fucking thing anymore and I'M SICK OF IT. I'm sick of every episode being about how Hartley is a strong and independent gay man instead of being about the fucking FLASH.

This has become *The Pied Piper Show featuring The Flash*. All season it's been about Hartley and his stupid bullshit. It's like awful tumbler fan fiction. Hartley is an awful character now, whining all the time and being a hypocritical asshole.

The writers keep pandering to the Bartley shippers and it's disgusting. This ridiculous Barry/Hartley relationship they forced into the story makes no sense!! They don't fit together at all!! Hartley is just an asshole and his melodrama just dominates everything!! Why are they together?! And when Barry got that cat but decided to re-home it because he couldn't take care of it, why the fuck was Hartley so fucking angry?! IT ISN'T YOUR CAT, ASSHOLE!! YOU DON'T GET A FUCKING SAY IN IT!!

Why the fuck would they have Dr Light blind him if they were just gonna miraculously cure him of it a few episodes later?? Are you kidding me?? They just cure his fucking blindness like it's nothing but don't share the cure with the world? Only Hartley is allowed to cure his disability?? Fuck you, writers. Fuck you.

When is Cisco gonna get a plot line?? He's been underutilized all season, just to make way for Hartley and his stupid bullshit. Cisco used to be the real hero of Star Labs but not Hartley does everything and he never gets the spotlight anymore!! Patty's romance with Barry was just shoved out the fucking door to make room for more Bartley garbage.

I can't take this shit anymore. They're ruined my favorite show. They clearly have no interest in listening to the fans and only care about the shitty tumbler crowd. I'm done watching this show.

^^^^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^^^^dedicate ^^^^^^^^^^this ^^^^^^^^^^thread ^^^^^^^^^^in ^^^^^^^^^^honor ^^^^^^^^^^of ^^^^^^^^^^my ^^^^^^^^^^/r/arrow ^^^^^^^^^^brothers ^^^^^^^^^^and ^^^^^^^^^^sisters.I've been seeing a lot of people complaining about Euron's outfit and I think a lot of you are missing the point. Putting aside the fact that the costume itself wouldn't be out of place in Essos where Euron traveled, the fact it's out of place in Westeros doesn't concern him.

If there's one word to describe Euron Greyjoy it's ""defiant"". He is a rebel that defies tradition, defies convention, defies pretty much everything including fashion. People say he looks out of place in the outfit, and that's exactly the point. He strolls into the throne room wearing whatever the hell he pleases, drawing attention to himself for being different and defiant of the norms.

I've seen people say he looks like a washed up rock star, and that's not an unfair comparison because Euron absolutely thinks of himself like a rock star. He believes he's the greatest captain the world has ever seen, he believes even queens would be willing to wed him simply on reputation and charisma. He insults the royal family to its face with the two good hands comment, openly admits he killed his brother and suggests the queen do it as well. When asked why he lost his bearings in a storm he responds ""I am the storm"".

He's a narcissist, and a big personality that puts himself above the conventions of others. When people point out that he's breaking those conventions, *he grins.*

So when you see him in a scene wearing an outfit like that, and you think ""it's totally out of place"", that is exactly the intent. He wants to upset the order.

And before anyone says ""well, the make-up"", the eye make-up keeps the sun out of his eyes while sailing. Football players do it all the time. Leather jerkins like the one he was wearing are not uncommon of the time period the show evokes either, especially when you consider that Euron has been traveling the world, not living in Westeros with its fashions.No, seriously, what we're *you* doing? National tragedy, hundreds dead, a country in total shock and mourning, what did you do that day? I remember what I was doing. I was in school, the principal made an announcement over the PA system, really broken up, I remember my teacher clutching her chest and having to sit down. I remember the rest of the day everyone was in somber, almost hushed tones talking about what happened. Watching the TV feverishly in class because the teachers were too shocked to teach. There were people crying, there were people who didn't know what to say so were just silent, there were people asking questions. There was some panic because we didn't understand what was going on, will there be more attacks, are we safe? Are there survivors in the debris, will they find them, is there something we can do to help? See, that's what massive unforseen tragedy and disaster does to a nation, Guggie. It puts it into shock.

So what did you do on 9/11, Guggie? Did you have arguments with your family over what lies you told? Did you hang out and have drinks in your loft and crack jokes about your parents? Did you seem to not give a flying fuck about the tragedy at all, as if it was just a thing that happened hours ago, let's move on with it? Cause watching this last episode where your characters don't seem to give a flying fuck about **the godamn nuclear explosion that killed tens of thousands of people in a suburb** makes me think you maybe don't actually understand what tragedy is. You must not have been here on 9/11 or the weeks following. Maybe you were off on whatever fucking organic planet you come from. Cause any American that is old enough to remember 9/11 knows how a fucking nation acts in response to massive disaster and tragedy. There wasn't a whole lotta family drama going on that day, Guggie.

Do you not understand what cause and effect is? Do you not understand what fallout is? For all the bullshit you write about guilt, you'd think you'd *at least* follow through with Felicity feeling guilty about what she had to do *but you didn't even do that*. She was as bubbly, smiley, and quipy as ever. After the 15 minute mark, was the nuclear explosion killing tens of thousands of people even mentioned again? Is that really no more important an idea to you than a car accident??

Maybe next time, give a little more time to addressing how that shit affects your story. Or do more Donna Smoak bullshit, whatever, it's your organic show.

dlefnemulb_rima,2,4,"I enjoy smoking, but I think I'd enjoy it more if I used more occasionally. Problem is, once i have some, my tendency is to smoke every day until I run out, and the gaps in between are getting shorter. I do not want to quit completely, but I feel I might be dependent in some way, and it is getting in the way of my productivity and motivation, as well as my enjoyment of cannabis.

I'm only going through an 8th in just under a month despite smoking almost every day as I tend not to smoke massive amounts to get really high, just enough to maintain a casual buzz and make killing time watching TV shows and crap more interesting. My problem is that if I have any weed and don't have to be anywhere, I will smoke. Cue arrested development marathons and adult swim cartoons. Which is fun and all, but gets repetitive every day, and is using time I could be spending sorting out stuff to sell or throw away for when I move, learning a language, arranging my travelling plans, practising bass.

I'd much rather have a productive and active day, then go smoke somewhere in the sun - a joint earned is a joint enjoyed or however the saying goes - but instead I'm just smoking impulsively. I'd like to hear from people who smoke occasionally by choice, and how they stop themselves from reaching for the bong at every opportunity.

Edit: lots of great advice guys, I'm currently skint and out of weed anyway so I'm going to have to take a few days break at least. In the meantime I'm going to start getting into the habit of deadlining my goals. I'm going to start with something small: to go through all my clothes and sort them into Keep, Sell, Throw Away/Donate. If I haven't got that done by the end of tomorrow, PapauNewGuinea can kick me in the balls.

Edit 2: Arbritrary 'Woah, front page! Thanks for the imaginary internet points guys!' Sincerely thanks though, I can draw much wisdom from you guys. I think there's a sap analogy in there somewhere lol.

Once I pick up some more I will take up BbFlat5's advice and try and go on more high-ventures and try to use weed more to improve an activity, rather than using it as an excuse to sit at my PC all day. Peace out!I've been working for this company for over a year now. It is a growing startup, and in that time I have gone from first line support monkey to unofficially managing a two man department for nearly 50 staff. I have also taken over the majority of sysadmin responsibilities from our consultant. Overseen moving of offices several times.

I have been pushing for a promotion for a while and have an open dialogue with management as to how I can improve to fit a management role in the company. The feedback and advice provided has been useful and I feel I'm making more changes towards being more communicative, organised and a better manager of my 1st line tech.

However, I recently found out they are splitting me and 1st line tech across two offices. A non-IT manager will be managing him and I will be responsible for the first line support again at my location. This is the opposite of the promotion I was hoping for.

Apparently it is due to management's dissatisfaction with the IT department's performance. Examples given are mistakes made that have caused email access to be lost in one office for a couple of hours, a PC forgotten to be swapped in after someone else was using their tower at the desk, not being the first person to suggest order of moving staff last office move, etc. I have accepted responsibility for the mistakes and listened to feedback on how we can improve. This being said I think these issues have become less likely than before, but we are dealing with larger volumes of changes and staff so perhaps it isn't appearing that way. 

It is worth noting that I am not qualified and have learned everything on the job and from home tinkering. I am paid accordingly. I agree that we have lots of progress to make to becoming an exemplary team. But I've been told I've been doing a good job training 1st line tech up. I've implemented a ticketing system that I think has helped us cover the additional demand of a growing company. I've written processes for common tasks like new user setup that have improved accuracy. I've learned a lot about networking, postfix and managing the mail server which has saved the company money on consultancy fees. I thought we were making steady progress to improve, but it seems management disagrees. They don't see 'amazing results' as we do not have time to complete projects on top of our duties maintaining our systems.

I don't know how to prove to them that we have become more effective, that I've become a better employee, that our value deserves recognition. Is my attitude or perspective the issue? I don't intend to make excuses but I feel we are doing the best we can with the resources we have. Does anyone else have experience with this kind of situation? I want to stay with the company as I love my coworkers and a lot of aspects of the culture, but if I am getting de facto demotion despite working harder than ever it's hard to see a future there. I don't know how I can continue fulfilling 2nd line support, sysadmin and security responsibilities when I am also expected to do half of the 1st line support.

Thanks

Edit: thanks for the honest advice guys I think the reality check has been helpful. I don't have anyone with a higher IT experience to learn off of so this has really made a big difference."
Nyxto,6,7,"Morpheus gives Mr. Anderson a choice. Blue pill, stay in the Matrix, Red pill, get out. The red pill is revealed to be a tracking program to pull him out of the people goo battery.

But what's the blue pill?

Later Morpheus explains that people who kind of like the control and are subconsciously willing to stay in the Matrix have the possibility to be morphed into agents. The rebels clearly have no qualms about killing ignorant law enforcement officers, and this is part of the reason: if you're the type to go into law enforcement you're more likely to be in favor of keeping the status quo, since that's your job, and thus more likely to be popped into being an agent.

If Mr. Anderson got that far in and decided to back out, with Morpheus and everyone there in an incredibly risky retrieval mission, he could turn into an agent any time, or given away some scrap of information to the machines. 

So reasonably, the blue pill wouldn't have Mr. Anderson go back to his normal life and wake up fine. It much more likely would've killed him.Ok, quills are a pain. You have to sharpen them, you need to get new ones, you have to keep dipping them in ink which gets everywhere. 

Why can't we use fountain pens? Those have been around for hundreds of years. Those at least we don't have to replace or sharpen. 

Why not ballpoint pens? I mean, those have been around since the 19th century, and I can get like, a whole pack of them for a... well for you it would be like, a couple of knuts or whatever you call them. 

Have you heard of a typewriter? Some use electricity but there's entirely mechanical ones. You just push buttons and letters get printed out onto your paper. 

Really this whole mess with the quills is like, a few centuries out of date. Why do we keep using them?This is an opinion piece, and not meant to be taken as literal fact or to spark an argument.

Everyone talks about how the Joker from Batman the Animated Series is the best, and it's the best version of the Batman stories. This is all true, in my opinion, but one of the reasons it's the best is that the character that, sadly, gets the least amount of actual character development and expression in other versions actually gets to shine in BMTAS. 

I'm talking, of course, about Batman himself. 

Yeah, he gets a lot of focus in the movies, games, and in the comics, but it's usually all backstory or setup for whatever twist they have for the setting. Once you get past that, though, Batman is used as a vessel for the story, rather than a character in it. The villains have more expression, plot, and change and we explore them more than we do Batman himself. Nine times out of ten, when you take in some Batman story, it follows a pretty similar arc. 

1) Introduction, either showing the version of the world for people who already know the set up, or giving the backstory and idea of Batman to the three people in the world who haven't heard it yet.

2) Bad thing starts to happen, Batman starts to investigate.

3) Villain is introduced

4) Story now focuses on the villain, with the occasional flashback for Batman to remind people his parents are, indeed, still dead. 

5) Story goes into the villain's motivation for the current escapade. No need to tell the backstory half the time, because *everyone* knows and pays attention to them. Story tells you what the villain did, why, how, and explores the motivations behind the action. 

6) BATMAN WINS YAAAAY.

While this works and can make great stories, where, exactly, does this show you what Bruce is like? Where's how he feels about it?

When Batman expresses any emotions in just about every media these days, I feel he expresses one *singular* emotion.

RAGE GRR ANGRY ANGST RAGE.

Seriously. He's become flat and two dimensional in a lot of stories. The last Batman game I played, he was a total jerk. Alfred, the person he trusts and cares about, arguably, the *most* in the world, makes suggestions for how to deal with the situation. What does Batman do? GRAR FUK U ALFRAD I AM BATMAN I AM SCARE RAWR I DO EVERYTHIN ANGAR. 

And he treats *everyone* this way! That's how he reacts to almost *every* situation on an emotional scale! 

Seriously, think about the last few movies, games, and comics you have gone through, and you will probably notice this pattern, or at least some of what I have said might ring true to you. 

Now, compare all of those to the Batman from the cartoon.

He's human, and a character. Sometimes, sure, the show focuses on other people, like a show should, but even then he shows a *range* of emotions. Happiness, snarkiness, attraction, joy, anger, and *fear*. Yeah, he shows fear! You know why? 

He's compassionate. He's actually a good person you would want to be around. You know, like a hero. Would *you* want to hang out with the Batman from, say, the most recent movies? Heck no. He shows little compassion for anyone, literally shouts all the time, and seems to give almost no regard to anyone. In the show, Batman *always* asks if people are ok after he rescues them. Every time. Even if he knows they probably are, he doesn't just jump off to punch someone, he takes a freaking moment to ask. He shows empathy to everyone in the show, regardless of their situation, even the mooks he's fighting. 

He isn't condescending or disregarding to anyone. Yeah, he sometimes has to put his foot down, but he acts like *everyone* who is helping him is important. Arguably, they are, even in the meta context of ""writers don't write stupid extra stuff and no one would animate it if it was"". The people in the show *are* competent, too! Alfred helps him solve crimes. Robin helps him solve crimes. Perhaps, most important to note here, the POLICE are competent! Gordon does solid police and detective work, and is a great leader of the force. Bullock, while crass, can handle himself in a fight, is an honest cop in a corrupt city, and keeps to his ideals. Montoya, who is usually a minor character in most things, sometimes takes down as many thugs as Batman, and is entirely competent at her job. The police aren't represented as bad guys, or mindlessly obeying the letter of the law, helpless bumbling rubes, or as antagonists to Batman. Rather, they are shown to have the same overall goals, and are working together to meet those goals. Sometimes there's conflict between Bullock and Batman about *how* to reach those goals, but they all agree they want to clean up Gotham. 

The best example of this is that, in the show, Batman and Gordon get together on New Years and have a cup of coffee together. Not to talk about business, not to yell at each other, not so Batman can seethe and rage, but just to have a friggin cup of coffee. He doesn't have to threaten the guy who owns the place, doesn't treat anyone like crap. 

[Seriously look at this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQe_WBtb1g0)

BATMAN EVEN SMILES. 

WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW BATMAN IN COSTUME SMILE?!

It's a human, touching moment, and shows that he cares about people, even the people of Gotham. 

When having a cup of coffee is too deep of a moment for Batman, you know he's a shallow character. 

Now, some of you might feel inclined to try to tell me why my opinion is wrong, and show examples of when this isn't true. I'll admit, I am not as fanatical about Batman as some of you are. I haven't read every book, comic, seen every thing and played every game, and don't keep a tackboard charting what's currently cannon or not. I'm also not saying that this sort of depth never shows up anywhere else in any other representation of Batman.  

However, in my experience, this sort of depth is only *consistent* with BMTAS. In other representations, this is the exception to the rule. "

Sogekingu88,9,3,"Hi,

We applied for a passport for our daughter by mail. Payment was taken in end july and still didnt receive it. We called last week and expedited our application for express review and said some one will call us in a week. Its almost a week and nothing. They said to not call back until 48hrs before if we didn’t have a call or something. Like seriously? You want us to stress out of our mind until 2days prior we leave?

Did some one go through something similar and was is resolved in time?

I was wondering if we can just show up at the office in person to make it go faster? All our paperwork is at the halifax office.

Starting to get stressed alot about it. This monday will basically start a 9 day window.

We are about 5hrs away from Halifax and I will probably need to take couple days off to go there.

Our trip is to Disney with my wheelchair user wife and daughter. With my wife condition without going in details, will most likely be our last couple years that we can make these kind of trips.

The more I google the more I get stressed out.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you

UPDATE:

Thanks every one for your feedback and some of you gave me great advices.

After user “Thedeaddrsunshine” comment, I went to look on requirements for land crossing in the US and children under 16yrs old dont need a passport. I contacted US border & customs and they confirmed that the birth certificate is enough. I currently have 2 version of my daughter birth certificate. One detailed with parents name (currently in Passport Canada hands) and an other one without the parents names on it (I have this one at home). I confirmed with the US b&c and they confirmed that the one I have in hand is enough. When they said that, I lost 200pounds 😂😂.

For people that are wondering why we asked fir a passport in the first place. We weren’t sure where we would take our flight at the start. With our multiple flights with our travels, we found that flights are usually cheaper around 3months prior the trip and we always book around that time for plane tickets. Flights from bangor came like 400$x3 compared to moncton and halifax. We will then cross by land to the US.

We still contacted our MP and they will push for our application.

Again thank you all.I feel that [this tool](https://daniel2013.github.io/satisfactory/calculator) is underrated. I always see people talking about [satisfactory-calculator.com](https://satisfactory-calculator.com) but never this tool. I feel that the graph tool used is far better and easier to have an overview of what you need and the numbers. Just wanted to show some love to this site. IMO this site is way better for big projects.Hi, I'm looking for a GPS Tracker that goes on my dog collar that can tell me where he is in real time. There is so many of them out there that I'm not sure which one to get. I dont mind having one with a monthly subscription if its worth it.

octopornopus,1,7,"It's been 15 months since I took on this challenge to shed my excess fat. I started last July at 365 lbs, and somewhere in the 45% body fat range. Today I'm just under 280 lbs and under 30% fat.


I've been on a keto diet for about 6 weeks, and it is going well. I don't eat out as much as I used to, but that's for the best. but when I do go out, I'm much more conscious about what I get. I've also completed C25K, and now run 5km every M/W/F at 5am. I also picked back up on resistance training, and go to the gym T/Th mornings, mainly doing endurance training, rather than low rep strength training. 


I'm signed up for the Bad Prom 5k next month, and found a powder blue tuxedo to wear while running, which should make for some snazzy prom pics. I'm not really interested in running a normal timed 5k, since I do that 3 times a week, so the novelty runs seem like fun.


Here be some pics:

smbrickner,8,2,"Was it a huge story?  I was pretty young when it happened so I don't remember hearing much about it.  Nowadays when a first round pick is traded the year after the draft it's a big story.  Was that the case in the early 90's?  I was about 7 at the time so I don't really remember.

giveusliberty,8,8,"I just logged in to my Spotify Family account to find out that someone had accessed it, removed a family member, and added a stranger to my plan whose name and email I was able to look up and find an associated LinkedIn profile from a guy in Sri Lanka. My account password was not changed.

You (and apparently Spotify) may think that it's just music and strong security isn't necessary, but your Spotify account contains your *name, email address, your phone number and its OS (if you provided it), date of birth, postal code, and the last four digits of your credit card*, which is about all the foothold a competent and motivated hacker needs to steal your identity or worse. That information is a social engineering goldmine. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)

The family plan also lists your family member's names (supposedly in the same household) and their email addresses, both of which provide additional attack vectors and could plausibly be used for social engineering attacks.

Given that they possess all of this information, they could and *should* take some very easy steps to provide additional security for your account, such as:

-Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). This is already standard practice for many companies and people have been [requesting that Spotify implement it](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Security-2-Factor-Authentication/idi-p/1017889) for some time but Spotify refuses. It should be an option for accounts that contain billing information and for users that want to enable it at the very least. 

-Email notifications for logins from unknown IP addresses (especially from different states and countries).

-Email notifications for password changes. I honestly thought they already did this because it's such a no-brainer, but I changed my password 20 minutes ago and haven't been notified of the change and after researching it, apparently they don't. Borderline negligent, IMO.

-Email notifications for billing changes

-Email notifications when family members are added or removed from the Family Plan.

Now, I was using an old password that had been compromised and I failed to update it everywhere, so that's on me. However, I have no idea when my Spotify account was accessed and updated, and had I not already known that this password was compromised or if it had been compromised recently, being sent a notification about my account being accessed would have alerted me to this fact much sooner and allowed me to take immediate action to secure other sites, services, or even computers and routers that may be using the same or a similar password, as well as to check my credit and bank history and set up alerts if necessary.

Email notifications can all be automated, so there's really no excuse for Spotify not to provide them and I get that 2FA can be a pain in the ass for less technologically inclined people which then becomes a pain in the ass for their customer service queue, but fewer accounts being hacked and needing to be verified and restored would likely offset that somewhat.

Edit: The password I was using was compromised in the Equifax hack and I had already updated the few services I knew were still using that password to use unique passphrases instead but Spotify slipped through the cracks because I log in so infrequently. I'm familiar with password security, I no longer use the same password for multiple services or devices, and I am aware of haveibeenpwned.com, which is how I knew about my compromised password. 

The point is that Spotify should be basing their security policies on the fact that most customers aren't going to be using sufficient security practices and are idiots, because we are, and had I not already known about that password being compromised and already taken action to secure everything else, the hacker might have had free reign to who knows what else for more than a year while an automated email from Spotify could have made me aware and allowed me to take precautions.There seems to be a lot of disagreement on this issue and I don't really have the expertise to form an opinion myself. Much of the criticism appears to stem more from the fact that the Chicago Boys were willing to work with the Pinochet regime rather than completely shunning him. 

However, I also get the impression that the economic liberalization and deregulation may have been too much, too fast, and gone a little too far, as well as being poorly timed in relation to economic problems in the world at large. Is that accurate?

Do you consider their influence on the Pinochet regime to be a net positive or negative? How much can their economic policies be blamed for Chile's economic downturn vs economic uncertainty caused by an oppressive regime that killed, imprisoned, and tortured thousands of people and pushed hundreds of thousands more into exile?

One specific question I also have is in regards to this paragraph from Wikipedia:

>Minister of Finance Sergio de Castro, departing from Friedman's support for free floating exchange rates, decided on a pegged exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar in June 1979, under the rationale of bringing Chile's rampant inflation to heel. The result, however, was that a serious balance-of-trade problem arose,[15] leading Milton Friedman to criticize De Castro and the fixed exchange rate in his Memoirs (""Chapter 24: Chile"", 1998).[16] Since Chilean peso inflation continued to outpace U.S. dollar inflation, every year Chilean buying power of foreign goods increased. When the bubble finally burst in late 1982, Chile slid into a severe recession that lasted more than two years.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_Chile#Reforms

Would sticking to free floating exchange rates as Friedman wanted have prevented or significantly reduced the 1982 recession?

gored_matador,2,8,"I've been having a really rough time at work lately. Moving targets with crazy deadlines, production repeatedly falling over, phone calls in the middle of the night, the standard set of headaches for an overworked admin.

But it's really starting to wear on me, and I just don't think it can keep on like this. I've started evaluating what my expenses are, what I'm currently making and what I'd need to just get by. Without having done up a formal budget, I think I can get by making a good bit less than what I do now, and I'm starting to think seriously about whether that's a good idea or not.

I'm wondering if anyone here has done this, and whether or not you're happy with the decision.

EDIT : Thanks for all of the feedback! It's encouraging to see that I'm not the only one faced with this situation. I don't know exactly what I'm going to do yet, but at least I know that plenty of other folks have gone down this road. I'd been a Linux sysadmin for a few years (did Linux app support for a while before that), and recently took a job doing network/infrastructure work. I've spent almost all of my time with this new job working in the development (non-production) environment, which recently suffered a security breach. A known exploit existed on an internet-facing DMZ system, and it was compromised. We only knew about it because the box was then used as part of a DDoS, sending out so much traffic that it saturated the outbound queue of our firewall and our internet access went down.

Since this is a development lab, and this is still a pretty small company (though growing quickly). Because they're small and relatively young, their environment hasn't been designed from the ground-up with security in mind (obviously). 

As a result of the breach, the team I work in has been given the official ownership of networking and security. I don't have any official background in security specifically - it's mostly best-practice knowledge I've inherited from mentors and reading. Most of that's been in Linux administration, though I've been able to work through semi-advanced things like setting up things like Kerberos & LDAP from the ground-up to provide centralized, secure authentication. 

When our team was given ownership of networking & security, I threw myself at it pretty aggressively. I've always been interested in moving into this field, though I never really had an opportunity. 

I audited the existing set of firewall rules, made a big report of what should be dropped completely, what could be allowed (if properly hardened), etc. I've been working with the various teams in the lab to get this stuff cleaned up, and I've gotten kudos on multiple occasions from many people for my efforts so far.

Also as a result of this security incident, they've decided to hire another person for our team with a background in security to help us get our environment up to snuff. Since I've managed to impress my boss(es) so far, they offered me the position before finalizing the requisition & posting it. 

I'm really interested in this kind of work, though my experience is pretty limited. Here's what I've been told about it so far:

1) My ass would *not* be on the line 24x7x365. They are expecting me to define policies based on best practices, and see them implemented (and then handed off to the teams responsible for their upkeep). If something goes wrong, I've been told that I'll be expected to analyze what happened, determine if it was a gap in our process/policy, or if somebody fucked up, and how to fix it & improve. 

2) Since it's a development lab, occasionally we're going to have to make Bad Decisions because product deadlines are at risk, and the business units are more concerned with a deliverable product than what the (not-yet-existing) infosec team says should be done.

3) In any case where I've made a decision that could impact schedules, for example, refusing to allow a known-flawed web service to be exposed to the internet, there are two managers that can override these decisions. When that happens, it will be recorded (e-mail, a wiki, some other doc archival solution) - and if anything negative happens as a result, my ass will be 100% covered. I already have that in an e-mail from my manager, and have been verbally assured of this by the team lead as well.

4) The position would not automatically translate into a raise, though I've also been told that when I hit the six month mark at this company a raise is basically guaranteed based on my performance so far. Whether I accept this new role or not, the raise should be coming my way. I've been fed that line before, but I genuinely believe it from these people.

I'm supposed to have a meeting with my team lead & manager, along with the director of the division I'm in to discuss the role in more detail on Monday. So far, the concerns I'd like to have discussed are:

1) Exactly how much of my ass is on the line. I'm fairly new to this particular discipline. 

2) What specific responsibilities are expected of me. Just drafting guidelines based on best practices, implementing them, ensuring their upkeep & adherence? 

3) Will I be able to sign up for training that's relevant to the job? I've heard great things about the Offensive Security classes, I'd *love* to sink my teeth into that.

If you folks have any advice, I'd love to hear it. I'll answer any questions I can about what I understand about the position so far, and I'll happily accept any questions you guys think I should be asking in the meeting.

__EDIT__: Thank you all for your input. You've all raised some really important questions that I'll need to get a better understanding of, which I can hopefully do in the meeting on Monday. Everyone's been pretty positive in their responses, and most importantly, there wasn't a chorus of ""OH SWEET LORD, NO - SAVE YOURSELF AND RUN"".

A lot of your responses about how indemnification is generally handled in these kinds of positions is helpful, too.

As long as there's nothing that comes out of the neighborhood as a red flag, I think I'm going to accept it.

I've also been told that I could basically define my own title, within the boundaries of reason and professional conduct. Someone mentioned ""Information Security Officer"" could apply to this position, but I'm certainly open to other suggestions. Comedy suggestions enthusiastically welcomed.I've been a smoker for many years, but I've just recently gotten into the whole concentrates world. I started out with a single gram of honeycomb (from a name brand strain), and at first, it looked pretty much like the photos I'd seen of honeycomb extract. 

I let that one gram last me a while (a few weeks at least), and towards the end, the stuff seemed to morph (melt?) into a less defined blob of goo with a slightly darker color that didn't taste quite as good. Being my first gram of oil, I probably did a few things wrong - I didn't yet have a silicone no-stick container (on the way), so I kept it in the little clear plastic container, and it probably got left out in the sunlight a few times.

I'm assuming that I unknowingly melted the honeycomb into some less defined form, but I don't know if that's true or not.

Anyone want to give me a little crash course in the differences between honeycomb, shatter, oil, and whatever other forms of BHO I might come across? Maybe I'm missing something basic.Obviously you want a [fuckin' picture](http://imgur.com/76ORE7s) of this masterpiece, 'cause it's off the goddamn wall.

What is it? A chickpea, edamame, pepper and onion skillet. It's cheap and easy to make. You can make it all organic and shit without needing to take out a loan. It's pretty goddamn healthy, too, if you're one of those pussies that doesn't want to mainline pork fat while chainsmoking Marlboros.

Ingredients:

1 tsp olive oil

1/2 cup diced onion (use red if you're a disgusting scumbag, I use yellow because I respect my mouth)

2 garlic cloves, minced

1 tsp minced fresh ginger

1 tsp curry powder

1/2 tsp ground cumin

1 1/2 cup frozen, shelled edamame

1 (14.5oz) can fire-roasted tomatoes, drained

1 bell pepper, diced

1 cup canned chickpeas, drained + rinsed

1/4 tsp salt

1/4 tsp black pepper

1. heat oil over medium heat. add onion, saute for 4 minutes. 
2. add garlic + ginger, saute for 2 minutes
3. add curry powder + cumin, saute for 30 seconds
4. add bell pepper, saute for another minute
5. add edamame, and cook until beans are tender (10-ish minutes)
6. add tomatoes, chickpeas, salt and pepper. saute for another minute or two, or until you can't wait any longer and must stuff your face right into the pan

you can serve it on rice, if you want. i served it on a bed of baby spinach. it's filling as fuck.Yesterday morning, one of the VMware hypervisors in our production network lost its mind and had a kernel panic/[PSOD](https://www.google.com/search?num=10&hl=en&safe=off&site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1230&bih=745&q=vmware+purple+screen+of+death&oq=vmware+purpl&gs_l=img.3.0.0i24l3.758.3277.0.4367.12.12.0.0.0.0.406.2154.5j3j1j2j1.12.0...0.0...1ac.LA3P2PCxxjc).

This server, like all of the other virt servers, has each port of its dual-port 10G NIC linked back up to one of the two 10G switches that form the core of our network. When the host crashed, it bridged the NIC ports & started sending out duplicate frames up both links to the 10G switches.

This broke the trunk that connected both 10G switches together, which resulted in the switches not being able to talk to each other. Which resulted in each switch actively trying to become the STP root, which cascaded into a whole other mess of problems with devices being unable to reach each other because that trunk between the two switches was dead.

It's pretty clear that the initial failure here, the hypervisor spewing the same frames out of each NIC port, is one of those ""THAT SHOULD NEVER FUCKING HAPPEN"" kind of problems -- but since it *did* happen, and it's an extremely disruptive failure mode, is there anything that can be done from the switching side to guard against this?

EDIT: Holy shit, I'm surprised to see so many comments. Sorry for my delayed response here - I took the weekend off to avoid computers, and the past couple of days have been spent on post-mortem meetings, write-ups, etc. Thanks for all of your feedback, and this incident has kicked off a full audit of all of our networking gear configs. It's clearly been too long.started reading /r/straya, saw pictures of butter & vegemite on toast and decided to order a bottle from amazon. what the hell, it's only like $11USD.

toasted up some bread, threw down some butter, threw a good layer of vegemite across the whole piece. none of this 'smear some on the corner and take dainty bites like a timid child' bullshit - no fuckin' around, just do up the whole piece of bread and dive in.

it's goddamn delicious. i'm immediately sold. i also tried throwing some sri racha on that bad boy - also delicious. don't know if that's a faux pas, though. i can't help it, i don't know any better.

mastapetz,6,10,"So after reading several simlar storries, and sometimes writing ""me too"" let me tell the full tale:

$me is me   $her  the lady in question  $rd1 and $rd2 other colleagues in office.

For it was one of those days. Checking and updating our database which has moments of me sitting infront of my PC looking like a very bored zombie. *$her* who only is every now and than in the office comes in sits down and is mumbling to herself (or to someone I didn't pay much attention neither did anybody else).

The printer is to the left of me. *$her* asigned seat to the right of me. I am  support for one of our specialist tools, so IT while not IT (don't ask).

I will also include some of *$her* monologues .. I am still not sure if they were monologues.

>**$her**: So this needs to be printed, oh my lots of pages. Which printer is this again? Oh this one.  
**$me**: *staring unfocused on my screen while the dataimport flashes green and white*  
>**$her**: (by now standing at the printer) Why isn't it doing anything. Oh now, wait ....  
>**$me**: *checking something on reddit for a tech problem I had before, blissfully unaware of what she wants*  
>**$her**: (reading screen of printer, it kinda sounded like I write it, if you wonder what the weird spacing is) TOoh neerrrr empty, pleeeessss reeeFFFFeeeellllll...  
>**$her**: Mastapetz! What does that mean?!?!?!  
>**$me**: (explains in German, turns back to work)  
>**$her**: Hooooow?  
>**$me**: The display shows you pictures, follow them.   
>**$her**: Where is the toh nuuuh, mastapetz?  
>**$me**: (sounding slightly irritated) How would I know.  
>**$her**: This is your office, you MUST know where the toh nuuuh is. 
>**$her**: Hey $rd1 and $rd2 why doesn't mastapetz know where the toh nuuuh is, do you know.  
>**$rd1** and **$rd2**: (look at her, at me, behind them in the open rack) Usually you need to get one from the front desk.  
>**$her**: mastapetz, go and ask the front desk and change the toner for me.  
**$me**: raises eyebrow  
>**$her**: You got nothing to do! I need to print this.  
>**$me**: I **am** working here on an important data import, which has to be finished **today** I need to watch for even the tinies of an error, so **no**  
>**$her**: But you are Aii Teeee!  
>**$me**: No, I am head admin and head support for this tool, not general IT.   Oh my import is done, and lots of red, I need to call someone now.  

I did not listen to her, am not sure if she talked to me, about me or anything else, the project I was working on was way more important than her print job at that point. 

Seriously, that woman feels so entitled sometimes, be it her opinion or something she needs. Everytime she is here the table looks like a mess of tossed around papers and her typing sounds a herd of hippopotamus is going over the keyboard. Like ""hey listen I am here and I am working, why aren't you working as loud as I am""

I always expect her to ask me to do something for her. No, I wont bring you coffee. No, i wont change toner for you. No, I wont refill paper I would not even know where it is.

On that a tidbit:  
>**$her**: Why don't you know where toh nuh and paper are? This is your office!!!  
>**$me**: (Sitting at a desk without almost no printed paper) The only thing I print 99% of the time, are labels for our tools. I don't need to know. When I need to replace it, I ask the front desk, like everybody else.  

One of the few people I actually dislike to have in our open space office. So  since I have some time on my hands waiting on a call from someone (oddly enough has to do with this story somehow) I will write something.

Off all Co-Workers I never met personally, this lady is my nr 1 enemy. It might be mutual by now.


Just a small info so you know whats up.

A pretty huge chain of private hospitals gave us the assignment to have the QoS for cleaning for ALL of their buildings. Which includes living Quarters for nurses, nurse schools, hospitals, home for elderly and kindergartens.

That Lady, in short W, was originally assignet to give us (me) all needed data for the import. That Data needs to be legible to me, so the first few attempts were a massive waste of time. Thus I make a form of how I need it, really easy to understand. Rows Named: ""Building"" ""Zone"" ""Floor"" ""Room"" ""Rotation"" ""Barcode""

One of the first calls:

>W: Hello W speaking, what can I do for you?  
>M: Hey W, mastapetz here. About the room book. Remember that I sent you a form of how I need it?  
>W: Yes. And I sent you a room book for--   
>M: Sorry to interrupt you, but you again sent me the direct SAP export, I can not work with that. Finding everything I need is impossible with that.  
>W: I don't have the time for that.  
>M: We *which is her, my direct boss, her direct boss, and her headoffice* agreed on you doing that. I can't possible know how YOUR building is set up, only you can know that.  
>W: Well I will try to send it to you as soon as possible, when can I get it.  
>M: (audible sigh) Two or Threedays maximum after you sent it to me in a legible format.  

So this was a very specific part of all the buildings. Something which actually ONLY HER could do because of all the recent changes. While I was waiting for this building I got from her headoffice within a week all but two buildings. Several not citation worthy call. Only hers was missing. ONE call though, it belongs into this, which was the very first time I decided she is my enemy.  Herr Boss **HB**  her **W** me **M**

>M: Hello Mastapetz speaking, how can I help you?  
>W / HB: Hi mastapetz W and HB speaking we have a problem with your import.  
>M: Oh, do tell.  
>W / HB: It takes super long.  
>M: What else is new? Your GSM connection is quite bad nothing **I** can do about.  
>W / HB: Well we have way to many options to chose from and this makes its way to complicated.  
>M: Well that was not my idea. I did as it was requested. I don't have the time right now to do something just to annoy someone. Remember I did indeed tell you this will be a pain to use. But you insisted on it.  
>W: You NEVER said something Like this.  
>HB: I neither know anything of this, this is completely new to me.  
*eyes rolling so hard my coworker needs to leave the room because of laughing so hard*  
>M: Well anyway, now I tell you, again. *proceeds to explain*  
>HB: Well you need to understand that we do way more work than you do. You need to understand you need to do it like we want you too. You need to understand that our work is important.  You need to understand how this work actually works.  
>M: *silence*  
>HB: Are you still there?  
>M: Of. Course. So let me be blunt. **NO** I do not need to understand how your work actually works. I am NOT getting paid for that one. I am getting paid to import and adminstrate the database. I import as I am being asked for. I know next to nothing how your building looks, works, handles stuff. That is YOUR job. YOUR job also is to give me thing I can work with.  
>HB / W: Well than we will need more support. How can we get to you.  
>M: Landline 20h/w, email outside of that.  
>HB / W: Whats your mobilephone number.  
>M: Don't have a company phone.  
>HB: Give me your private number.  
>M: Unless you pay 20 € per beginning hour, you won't get my private number.  
>HB: You get paid to --  
>M: I get paid to work in the office. When I clock out, I don't get paid. And I don't want anyone to call my private number in my off time for support without getting paid.  
>HB:  I will talk to your --  
>B: Yeah talk to him, he will tell you the same.  
*He actually was listening to the whole thing, but officially wasn't in the building.*

*HB had to leave call continues*  
>W: So about that building.  
>M: Did you send me the room book like I asked you?  
>W: I send you a room book.   
>M: Yeah the one I told you I can NOT work with.  
>W: Why not?  
>M: I told you why more than once.  
>W: You will get it tomorrow.  
>M: I am indeed looking forward to that one.  
*guess what did not come the next day*  

3 Months later, I finally got the roombook, I imported it like it was written, the barcodes don't work. Nobody was surprised, but W.

>M: Hi W. What can I do for you.  
>W: This does not work.  
>M: What does.  
>W: The Barcodes.  
>M: Well I told you, that if you are NOT certain about the Barcodes being correct, the chance of them NOT working is very very likely.  
>W: So print them out for me, new ones.  
>M: *laughing* I doubt my boss will allow that.  Do you even have someone who  can attach those barcodes? These are over 3000 barcodes, we needed for 800 two days and we agreed on never ever doing this again if the codes are more than 40 in a single object.  
>W: What should I do with this fucking shit.  
>M: Well, either get the correct Barcodes, or do it per hand.  
>W: Do you know how many Rooms we need to check each day?  
>M: No. You also don't need to tell me. Nothing I can change unless you give me working codes.  
>W: Know what, fuck that shit. Fuck that. I wont fucking do anything with that fucking shit system and I will tell my boss and your boss.  
>M: Well as if I give a fuck what you do. Don't shit your pants *I actually said that* If your customer is ok with you not doing the job you are payed for. I don't care.
>W: *hangs up very audibly*  

Again another call later.

Another building which import was delayed, well 1) I was on Vacation 2) we had a several billion customer which had a priority over this not even 20k/year building 3) incomplete data.

>W: Hey mastapetz, when will you do this.  
>M: Oh, hi W. I was on vacation, currently working on a high priority customer. End of next week.  If you send me the complete data and in the form I need it, we have been over this.   
>W: If you let me wait longer you can wait for the data next time too.   
>M: Oh. No problem. I will let you wait the same amount of time you let ME wait for YOUR customer. Three months. And you know what? I have enough work on my table to fill all those 3 months fully without even NEEDING an excuse why I am not working on yours.  
>W: *suddenly sounding REALLY friendly* OK you will get it today *and I got it the same hour*  

This was very long, there might be some format errors (I will be working on) some grammar mistakes (if I find them I will correct them) 

When this person calls, I need to make sure I have my stress relieving ball outdise, or I might start screaming obsceneties.
So this happened just after I came into office, you will have **M**e, My **B**oss  and that **L**ady

>B: Hei mastapetz, L has a problem with the stuff we handed her, check out what it is.  
>M: Did she say what?  
>B: 'It doesn't work', she said.  
>M: Ok I'll check before I call her.  

During the import a certain checkmark didn't get imported, thus not systemready. 5 Minutes and I solved that one. So on for the call.

>M: Hey there **L**. Mastapetz here, was your problem (short example), it should work now ?  
>L: Yes this was it (proceeds to babble about this problem like it still exists)  
>M: *friendly mhming and starting to end it*  
>L: Oh and Mastapetz? I got an email saying something about times not reached.  
>M: *here we go* Yes this is an email which everyone in this field gets now in intervalls, telling them which objects still have open time and which are finished for the month.  
>L: But Why.  
>M: So you know what still is done.  
>L: But what does it do?  
>M: *repeats above*  
>L: Why?  
>M: Visibility of Workprogress to avoid penalty payments to the customer.  
>L: But what does it mean?  

This goes on for 10-20 minutes. Me having a still polite, but bored monotounus tone in my voice.  

>L: I will need to call B and ask him...  
>M: Well do so, but B will tell you exactly the same.  
>B: *starts laughing hard*  
>L: But what does it really do ...    
>M: *same as above just shorter*  
>B: *laughs harder* random coworker 'why does mastapetz look like in pain?'  
>M: Ok I need to end it here, if there is anything else call me.  
>L: Ok Bye bye...   
>M: *hangs up and looks like I could need a bucket of coffee*  

That was before my first morning coffee. The special kind of groundhogday hellSo beginning of April on of our leading guys in a specific department left. For me it was out of the blue but considering his attitude sometimes, not entirely unexpected. This only is important because now his superior needs to do this stuff.

So $ng  ""new guy""  $mb  ""my boss""  $me ... well me, yours truly mastapetz

Day before Yesterday:  
>**$ng**: Hey masta, since this guy is gone, I need to do his stuff, I need access to that  
>**$me**: *me not knowing by heart what 'that' is* ""That"" being what?  
>**$ng**: *annoyed* Well everything  
>**$me**: Well, ok.  *I do not have time for that kind of shit, I just rename the old used to new user and change everything and send him everything needed*  

Yesterday:  
>**$ng**: *comes in agitated* It's not working.  
>**$me**: *mid call, with headset on tell my phone partner to hold on for a second* What is?  
>**$ng**: The account  
>**$me**:  ... I take a look, when I finish this call ...    
>**$ng**: *huffs and leaves*

I check everything while on the phone, like I assumed, it works. In the back of my head I already know the problem. Our IT set up our citrix enviroment hair raisingly bad, my boss and me refuse to work with it where possible. We have two internet explorer ""installs"" one is the citrix version, the other the local version. Since THIS is 'general IT' it is not my responsibility, I  only am responsible for a special system.  
  
  
>**$me**: So I checked it, the username and password wor....  
>**$ng**: *motions frantically to his pc*  not. working.  
>**$me**: *noticing his laptop, and citrix client known what is going on, but try his cridentials anyway*  Yeah that is on our IT we have a 'local' and a 'citrix' browser I don't know which is which and neither which to use, ca...  
>**$ng**: So fix it!  
>**$me**: Call IT and tell them you need to know which browser to use for this tool they will help you, they know of the issue.  
>**$ng**: Why dont you fix it.  
>**$me**: *already leaving* Because THAT is not my responsibility.  

2 hours later he comes in again.  
>**$ng**: I need log in details for our customer.  
*Since I know we usually don't want that since the system aint THAT easy to understand and shows more than our contract makes us show them.*  
>**$me**: What should the customer see?  
>**$ng**: Everything.  
>**$me**: Everything, of what.  
>**$ng**: *proceeds to blabber a lot of stuff, I understand half of it and know that half of what he wants aint even possible, yet*  
>**$me**: Well send an email of what you need to me and my boss.  
>**$ng**: I just told you what I need!  
>**$me**: Email. Boss. Me. *take next incoming call and ignore him*   

15 minutes later he comes in. and puts a piece of paper on my table, clearly a printed out email.  
  
>**$ng**: Paper will do *I am not sure but I think he waved his had at me*  
>**$me**: What ... should I do with this?  
>**$ng**: Just send me what it says.  
>**$me**: Like I told you. Mail. Boss. Me.  
>**$ng**: *taking the paper from me* I will need that if I need to send you an Email.  

5 minutes later an Email with 4 lines a total of 18 words, I have absolutely no idea what he wants. Best part ""I need this until Thuesday 12 PM"" at Thursday 3pm, my usual office times are weekdays 9AM to 1PM.

I wrote him an email, a long one, exclaiming pricely what I need.  

today:
>**$mb**: Your email to $ng was good, I will send something additional, because I too have no idea what he needs, I know what he wants but he needs to communicate it clearly.  
>**$me**: And his ""until"" ?  
>**$mb**: Well if he doesnt give you what you need you can't answer his questions, and if he doesnt react to your OR to my email its his head not ours.

Bit longer than I intended it to be. But I think this guy wants to be a Jedi, to bad mind tricks dont work on me. OH and I still can not read minds, and I am quite happy.So I work at a big company, while my main function is  looking after and importing Data in our QoS System, I also am main person for problems with the system on the mobile devices that are used. I do this for Cleaning, Catering and... Security. Security means the mobile devices can't be access by teamviewer (not iPhones) which is important for this story.

Day 1:

I get a call from our reception that there is a Call from a Miss B, and she wants to speak to me. I at first have no idea who that is, but if someone demands me specifically it means it is about the system I am the admin of. 

>M: Hi, mastapetz speaking, what can I do for you?  
>B: Yes I am here for Hospital A and my system does not work  
(she sounds like she just woke up, it was 1PM, she worked the night shift)    
>M: Please help me, for this Location I have in all three systems and not all of them have a name to their mobile device.  
>B: Security. It does not work.    
>M: What, does not work?    
>B: The System.  
>M: *sighing audibly* I need specific answers, I can not work with ""The System"" the System has a lot of parts that can have issues.  
>B: Well when I scan, I have to click, and to click, than I have to click (She actually said it like that)  
>M: So ... you are saying, from what I am understanding, it works like it should?  
>B: No it does not. Connect to the phone and look at it.  
>M: I can't do that, it is a security device which doesn't allow remote acc--   
>B: But how can you help me?    
>M: Turn the phone on and tell me--   
>B: I don't have the phone with me, it is at the Hospital and I live 1 hour from there can't you--    
>M: No. I can't. Without you having the mobile I cannot do anything.    
>B: But what ....    
>M: Make screenshots of the problem and send them to me.  
>B: *mumbles something* OK    

I go over to her direct boss, tell him I have no idea whats up with that lady. He tells me she is a bit slow with explaining and understanding, but she just called him why he was in a call he will try to figure it out.

Several Days Later, again call to reception 9:00 AM :

>M: Hi, mastapetz speaking. What can I help you with Ms B?  
>B: So I made pictures with my private mobile from the work mobile. What should I do with it?  
>M: Send them to me.  
>B: But I need this to be solved ASAP or I can't work with it.  
>M: Send them to me now, and I will look into it.  
>B: OK I will send them now.  

13:00 I am in a call with the provider of this tool because of another customer, seeing a incoming call from the reception desk, at the same moment I got the email with the pictures. While I was waiting for my issue to be solved I looked at the picture, and everything looked EXACTLY like it should.

>M: Hi theire Ms. B, Mastapetz speaking.  
>B: Oh did you solve the problem? I don't like to wait.  
>M: One, you sent them to me 4 hours after you said you will. Two, your pictures tell me everything works like it should.  
>B: But.... It is not like the old system where we did not have to do that.  
>M: Yes. This is a new system.  
>B: But it makes the check take longer, and we don't want that.  
>M: Look. I am not responsible for you not liking your work times. I can assure you we give a damn about the check taking 5 minutes longer, if you are supposed to be there from 8pm to 7 AM. But I happily tell your direct boss about this issue.  
>B: Yes and I will too  

I need to have a lot of patience, a lot of our ladies in the field have 0 knowledge of anything on their mobile phone... at least if they don't WANT to have knowledge of it. Knows perfectly how to use Whatsapp, how to set the company phone to a language nobody but her understands, but that software which she got several  tutorials, and personal explanations AND where possible also remote... nah cant have that.

Story might not be as entertaining as some others. But let me tell you, this lady made my head hurt hard.We have a certain ILA customer. I know it exists, I know they have an 'account' with the tool I admin, but they are not my responsibility nor anybody elses in my office. My bosses do know them, but dont know anything about the tool stuff.

Last thursday:

Call 1

Site Assitant from us for the customer (**$SA**)Me (**$me**)

>$me: Hello Mastapetz here how can I help you  
>$SA: Hello here is (name) for (customer) calling in for an issue with (tool)  
>$me: Officially I don't know you exist since you are not on my admin privileges, but maybe I can help you.  
>$SA: So, I have this iPad (inner me: ""oh no""), and I do not know the apple ID.  
>$me: You see, I am only able to help with (tool) related things, for everything else you need to call our IT Support.  
>$SA: But (name I never heard before) said you will help me with that.  
>$me: Not with hardware issues, (tool) only, call our IT with the number .....  
>%SA: Ok I will thank you.

Me to myself, ""that was odd"".

10 minutes later

Call 2

>$me (seing its our IT):  Hey $ITguy sup.  
>$ITguy: Sup petz, just got a call from $SA and she ---  
>$me: --- wanted the apple ID of ---  
>$ITguy: this iPad, do you have it?  
>$me: (laughing) How and why should I, did you sent her one of our two?  
>$ITguy: No. Where did she get it from?  
>$me: Beats me, she said from us (company not our IT directly)  
>$ITguy: Do we even have (customer) with that?  
>$me: Yes, but not our country but ...  
>$ITguy: Well ... not our problem than  
>$me: Yep, cya

Some other calls in between

2 hours later

Call 3

>$me (seeing its IT guy from the tools company): Yo man, let me guess you call because of $SA's iPad  
>$TCguy: Yes, that too, how do you know.  
>$me: Yours is the third call, and since this is the only thing that stirred up ...  
>$TCguy: As I thought, you don't even have access to it since its not your countries group. Any idea where she got it though?  
>$me: Neither me nor our IT knows. I also don't know why she calls me. Anyway whats the other thing  
  

I tell my boss today and he blasts off at me why I am not calling everybody to figure that out. I shrugged at him. I literally am not paid to do that. Customer might be in my country, but I got no place doing anything with ILA. (God I need a new job)

This still puzzles me, I mean, we have a LOT of licenses for this tool. I have access to the whole lot of 3 complete countries, logging into my account and loading up all projects takes a while. Yet this was the only time nobody knew who is responsible for a single piece of equipment. Why I should be the crazy phone joker to call through the whole company, if even the ones that actually are paid to do this have no idea.

I love to help, but here its like ""Nope, can't help you bruv"".Weird title? Yes but I can't  figure out a better one.

This is again abour Miss B I wrote earlier, if I remember correcly.

We installed in the Object she is assigned to a Security System with NFC Tags and Mobile Device(s) for scanning, and answering minimal Question(s)

I had to cancle my offtime because of an ""emergency"", checked everything before hand and solved the mistake that caused the emergency. In total 6 hours of driving, and 90 minutes of working explaining everything to her (several times, because damn goldfish brain)

Everything worked, and was working for a week, than monday (the day before yesterday) call ""Give me new License on my private device so I can do it in case work device stops working again"", I politely tell her no, but I expect shit to hit the fan. Tuesday I had a day off. 

Today 9AM I get into office:

>MB (my boss): Yo Mastapetz, B called N claiming it doesnt work. N called Me asking ""wtf""  
>Me: *raised eyebrow* I tested it, W tested it, she tested it, security workers 1-5 worked with it. No problems. What the hell?  
>MB: OK lets call her later.  
>Me: Oh hell, you are in for something you won't believe.  

We worked on something before. End of month = several shits hitting the same fan at once.

>MB: OK mastapetz, chop chop, lets call her.  
>Me: *grabbing coffee and mumbling under my breath like mutley the snickering hound*  
>MB: Hi Ms B. You said you have troubles with the System. What are the troubles?  
>B: That f\* s\* doesn't f\* work this s\* wastes my f\* time s\*f\* (lots of swearing)    
>Me: *silent growling*  
>MB: *looks at me with a what the actual f look*  
>MB: So could it be that  
>B: *keeps mumbling and cussing, I stopped listening to her at that point*  
>MB: Are you sure you did as told. Chose Object, click next, scan the NFV ?  
>B: *by now I think she has some kind of tourette syndrome* Yes I know how this works I even showed it to the security workers  
>Me: *coughing*  
>MB: *trying not to laugh*  
>MB: Ms B. We had a similar problem at a another Object. Same thing as with your Object, ""Can't read NFC"", ""Devices takes long to read NFC"", ""Cant find code of NFC in database"". The problem always was, that the assigned worker needed more training.  
>B: *starts howling and crying like an offspring of Prince Valium and the Hound of Baskerville* Something something time (sobbs) something something (sobbs) (whine pitch getting higher)  

That was the point I  literally tossed my hands into the air like with a table flip and stormed out of the office to get some not so fresh air in the lobby.  I felt my heartbeat in my neck and my temples and was about to snap. 

3 minutes later  

>MB: Calm down, we will help you    
>B: *stopped howling  by now* Yeah but this doesn work. It just doesnt work    
>Me: It works, we WILL test it again. The Data is correct, I checked that. If it DOES work. Which it WILL. We will send you a tutorial. which should be sufficient *under my breath 'even for you'*  
>B: Still moaning about how hard the system is.  
>Me: *making the universial hand motion for f\* it* 'MB, I need to finish that.'  
>MB: *nodding to me*  OK mastapetz now will set up the test and we will get to you in the afternoon.  


We called the head of the security department about her. Yeah she is known to be whiney when under stress, she likes to howl. While she does good work, she is quite dense (he didnt say dense, but .. well you knew he meant it). Apparently, she calls so often that everybody starts to get agitated when she calls in. Both Front Desk Ladies can't stand her. IT can't stand her, Security neither and we start to feel sorry for all of them)

You remember that woman I wrote about. Ms W? I had the honor of meeting her and see her problems with the system first hand. While she still was annoying about it,  (I guess she caught my drift when I dropped my voice to a deep growl when explaining again) she listened to reason, she even praised my work at my boss. I only mention this, because with her I could work out what the problem is. 


With Ms B though. She seems to be wrong in the job. Not being able to take stress well, in a job where stress is probably the first thing you are asked to endure, nopety nope. I wouldn't want to trade with her. 


Short system explanation:

Start App> New Check > Choose Object > Next > Scan NFC> Answer Question > Finish.

Done.
A little bit different, I was just the used tool for everything but since I am responsible the tool I handled it struck me a bit .. odd.

Come into office early, my boss tells me that a customer has problems saving files from a certain sharepoint we use. He is having *this problem* too. He pronounced it awkwardly enough for me to raise an eyebrow.

What was the problem. Since this sharepoint has the setting that file names must not be ""clear text"" and some other (bullshit) reasons, you can't ""right click save as"" you need to open it and save it. Just, it gets opened with the name ""AccessForm.\*\*\*""  The \* being for the file format. The user didn't know how to save them with the correct name.

So he said to my boss, who said it to me


>$derp: I want you to save all files in these folders, name them correctly and mail them to me. 

Problem was, most files were over 8 MB, and our IT set the max attachment size to 8 MB. Also important to know, all of these things were Invoice kind of stuff, which is far out of my work field, so I am not even reading anything.

Next day:


>$derp: (per mail) The Files A B F X C and S miss a certain Signature, which means YOU did not do it. And if we don't get the propper signature we will demand all the money from the last year back.

Of course he sent the files again back to me. Me being super confused, open each file several times and always see a signature which means that this invoice was accepted by the apropriate person at the object. But he wanted a special person to sign them because apperently the company which did that job for us (its something where you need a certificate which only few companies get because its so special) did not really do it unless that one person signed it.

ANd from the sounds of it, this guy does this at leats once a month on different things, and I a reaaally happy I normaly dont need to interact with that guy.This just happened, my brain was in pain, my temples were throbbing but my coffeemug empty.  
$M  well yours truly  
$FE  female employee  
$ME  male employee  

Phone ringing, I see $FE's name and was prepared for a lot.  
>$FE $ME ""Hey masta""  
>$M ""Hi what can I help you with""  
>$FE  ""I need the new app for that and the new app for that and the new app for that and the new app for that""  
She mixed up quite a lot of thing here, so I had no idea what shea wanted wit 3 of those 4 things.  
>$ME ""Did you understand what $FE needs?""
>$M ""Not the slightest"" ""Do need something for this or for that Project""  
>$FE ""Yes""  
>$M ""... uuuuuh ... let me connect to your phone so I can see what you need""  
>$FE ""I need the new app and the new app..""  
>$M *interrupting* ""**FIRST!** So you mean the one for the quality thing. Let us do one thing after the other.""  
>$FE  ""OK Thank you""  
>$ME ""Does she still need the old App or can we delete it""  
>$M ""The old App no longer works n....""  
>$FE ""BUT I STILL NEEEEED IT""  
>$M ""It no...""  
>$FE ""I **NEEEEEEEEED** IT""  
>$M ""**NO** you do not, it no longer works""  
>$FE snippish ""If I scan it will""  
>$M ""Just. No.""  
I Uninstalled the new app, exactly knowing she would use the not working old app as excuse not to do her work... she did so before.  
>$M ""Anything else I can help you with?""  
>$ME and $FE: No Thank you, bye bye  

Not even 5 Minutes later the phone rings again.  

>both ""Hi again, we did not do the other app""  
>$M ""For?""  
>$ME *explains*  
>$M  ""Just to be clear, those two need different tags and different tool, you know that, right?""  
> both *agreement*  
>$M *after I connect* ""OK your device does not have enough storage. This is the Software. Do you know to install it? Do you have the tutorial for this I made for you?""  
>both *yes to both*  ""Bye bye  
  
2 Minutes, Phone rings again.  
>$FE  ""I installed this now, how does it work""  
>$M ""Do you have the tutorial printed?""  
>$FE  ""Yes""  (Say it like confused borat and you know how she sounded with this yes)  
>$FE ""Explain to me""  
>$M *connects to phone* ""This is the App icon"" "".....""  ""Tap on it""  *App opens*  ""Lift the phone from the table so you see what the cam sees""  
>$FE  ""What do I need to do now""  
>$M  ""What does the tutorial say. Page 1 Picture 2""  
>$FE  *reads it to me* ""So this working?""  
>$M  *rather confused by the last statement* ""Yes""  
>$FE  ""Thank you. Bye Bye  

Two more calls. One she says she needs a tag, until she understood I need it by mail a lot of time (it felt like a lot) passed. Second one she needed an explanation of the new tool. She didn't ask for it so I thought she had someone explained it to her already.

It really felt to me like I was wasting not just my time, but she also hers and that of her superior. One short mail ahead and I could have solved everything with much less headache for everyone. 

Maybe not as much ""fun"" as some others of mine or in here. But daaaang"

He is/was a red head. He left the band for maybe 1-2 years possibly around 2010. He ended up dating a somewhat famous band groupie, who some have speculated was the reason he left the band. He then broke it off with her and rejoined the band. 

I know this isn’t a lot to off of but any help would be fantastic.So far I can see Invoker being OP. He has multiple buffs including items that suit him perfectly. As the title says. I am looking for a slim fitting burgondy/maroon shirt. I've been trying to find one from the usual brands, but haven't had any luck. I was wondering if any of you guys know of brands that have this shirt is a really slim fitting form. "

fiskiligr,9,5,"[Edvard Radzinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Radzinsky) wrote the book [_Stalin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin_(Radzinsky_book\)) in which the claim is made that:

> Stalin explaining his role [to his mother]: ""Mama, do you remember our tsar? Well, I'm something like the tsar,"" and [his mother] responding ""You'd have done better to become a priest.""

I am wondering how reliable Radzinsky is as a historian, and whether there is any evidence for this quote. 

For context, this quote received over 11,000 upvotes in /r/todayilearned: 

https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/86en3v/til_that_when_stalin_visited_his_mother_in_1935/

As you would expect, so-called Marxists-Leninists tend to claim Radzinsky is an unreliable, right-wing source that can't be trusted. Is there any evidence for this counter-claim?[★★★★★](http://zedge.net/r1908294?src=d)Before starting it should be said that I hold critical support and try to show solidarity with umbrella leftist movements like social democracy, democratic socialism, etc. Still, part of showing critical support is challenging these allies to adhere to truth.

This meme seems to be going around: https://web.archive.org/save/https://old.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/c0fon6/facts/

It's [a picture of FDR](https://web.archive.org/web/20190614162039/https://i.redd.it/l7y5701hz8431.jpg) and the caption says:

> The last time a Democratic Socialist was president he was re-elected so many times

> They enacted terms limits

There is already confusion about what it means to be socialist, and people like Bernie try to [present social democracy as democratic socialism](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/01/democratic-socialism-government-bernie-sanders-primary-president/). 

That aside, FDR is hard to describe as adhering to any ideology strictly, and certainly not democratic socialism. It is probably most accurate to say he generally advocated for social liberalism. 

See Howard Zinn's _Politics of History_, chatper 7, ""The Limits of the New Deal""

> The word ""pragmatic"" has been used, more often perhaps than any other, to describe the thinking of the New Dealers. It refers to the experimental method of the Roosevelt administration, the improvisation from one step to the next, the lack of system or long-range program or theoretical commitment. Richard Hofstadter, in fact, says that the only important contribution to political theory to come out of the Roosevelt administration was made by Thurman Arnold, particularly in his two books, _The Symbols of Government_ and _The Folklore of Capitalism_. Hofstadter describes Arnold's writing as ""the theoretical equivalent of FDR's opportunistic virtuosity in practical politics -- a theory that attacks theories."" 

> ...

> As was true of his associate, Thurman Arnold, FDR's experimentalism and iconoclasm were not devoid of standards and ideals. They had a certain direction, which was towards government intervention in the economy to prevent depression, to help the poor, and to curb ruthless practices in big business. Roosevelt's speeches had the flavor of a moral crusade.

> ...

> But FDR's ideas did not have enough clarity to avoid stumbling from one approach to another: from constant promises to balance the budget, to large-scale spending in emergencies; from an attempt to reconcile big business interests and labor interests (as in the National Recovery Act), to belated support for a pro-labor National Labor Regulations Act; from special concern for the tenant farmer (in the Resettlement Administration), to a stress on generous price supports for the large commercial farmer (in the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938). 

> His ideas on political leadership showed the same indecision, the same constriction of boundaries, as did his ideas about economic reform. Roosevelt was cautious about supporting the kind of candidates in 1934 (Socialist Upton Sinclair in California, Progressive Gifford Pinchot in Pennsylvania) who represented bold approaches to economic and social change; and when he did decide to take vigorous action against conservative Congressional candidates in 1938, he did so too late and too timorously. He often attempted to lead Congress in a forceful way to support his economic program; yet his leadership was confined to working with the existing Congressional leadership, including many Southern conservatives who ruled important committees. 

Hopefully this is enough to show that FDR was far from being anything like a democratic socialist, and that he fits better under the camp of social liberalism, though he undoubtably showed little consistency with his political ideology - helping the poor but too little and too late while also protecting the interests of moneyed elites and big business.https://np.reddit.com/r/Hunting/comments/dxboex/now_thats_dedication/f7y1yeg/

P2: Marx defined communism as stateless, and the entire idea behind Marx's socialism is directly democratic management of production by the workers themselves. The entire idea of communism is to bring about the end to the State.

Conservativism has a long history of wanting the opposite of power for the people, it has traditionally wished to secure power in the hands of the existing rulers - through history this has been in the form of defending autocracy, monarchy, or even retrograde forms of liberalism. What is consistent among conservativism is the defense of the status quo and established social hierarchies - traditionally this has been aligned _against_ popular socially equalizing movements. 

Federalism is also the opposite of limited government, by definition - federalism seeks to form a strong central / federal government. Anti-federalists are traditionally those opposed to a strong central government, advocating for state and local rights."

Smokey_Joe,6,4,"I feel like the collective hive mind is just five dudes trying to 1-up each other to fill some empty space in their psyches and myself watching it all unfold. Day after day, just a handful of people doing nothing but pathologically lying for karma(not Karma, but Reddit karma ;]) just to appease some missing piece of their souls. 

Maybe I'm a little jaded from all the lurking I've been doing, but people don't seem to be wanting to learn from posts, but rather make the easiest joke and wait for the validation. And of course there ARE thoughtful replies, you just have to dig for them. I mean, it's easier to up vote something that made you laugh as opposed to something really thought-provoking. Sometimes you don't even realize the impact of some things until much later when it really applies to your life.

Anyways, I want to thank you guys for giving me a place to go on this website that reminds me how unique and thoughtful my fellow Redditors really are. The hive mind isn't a stagnant pool of mindless acceptance, bit really a hub of beautiful and free thought. You just have to know where to look.

It seems like it could be a fun game to pick up on a rainy day with a couple packs of cards laying around the house.

It seems like some pretty heavy shit to just drop on your head and be like ""oh, hey, good luck figuring THIS shit out.""

I noticed it states that it is an (E) room but putting a dweller to work there also seems to have no effect.I've been a daily smoker for about three and a half years now and it's starting to get to me. My tolerance is TOO DAMN HIGH, I'm spending way too much money, and worst of all I have no motivation.

I've been unemployed and smoking more than I ever have before, and decided it's time to call it quits for a while. I've always told myself that quitting smoking would be nothing, but at this point in time I'm not so sure how true that is. All my friends smoke weed, and honestly it seems sometimes like I wouldn't ever have anything to do with anybody if it weren't for weed. 

I guess this isn't really the right place for this, but I feel like if I tell some other people I'm going to do it, I might feel more encouraged to actually do it, and most of my friends would just laugh at me. 

So, wish me luck, starting tomorrow. "

snowywind,3,8,"Whatever Michael does, Eleanor will figure it out. The only way forward is for Michael to accept that and work it into the plan. Therefore Michael needs to let Eleanor in on ""The Good Place"" and get her to work for him before she blurts it out to the others.

Based on the names of future episodes listed [here](https://www.tvtime.com/en/show/311711/episode/6141747) (Thanks /u/MadDoctor5813 for that link.) I'm guessing that ep. 5 ""Existential Crisis"" has Michael breaking down and coming to the above conclusion about Eleanor with the final scene being an ""Eleanor, we need to chat"" moment. At this point he probably recognizes that spark she gets in her eyes when she's about to pull ""an Eleanor"".

Also, I should note, I'm counting the hour long premiere as ep. 1-2 whereas the site linked just counts it as ep. 1.

Ep. 6 ""The Trolley Problem"" picks up with the recruitment pitch. Basically Eleanor has the choice between helping to torture the other three herself or allowing them greater torture (butt spiders and penis flatteners) at the hands of someone else. The kicker will be that she herself will be tortured as well if she refuses to cooperate but that motivation will fade in importance by the end of the season.

Ep. 7 ""Janet and Michael"" could be a flashback episode about Michael stealing Janet from a real good place, but I think it'll actually be about Michael needing a confidant of some sorts and Janet is as close to neutral as he can find. He still needs to torture Eleanor so he'll have to work that into how he forces her to torture the others. The other demons can't know that she's in on it so he has no allies there. Janet, although seemingly more aligned with the humans and Jason in particular, may be obligated to follow direct orders from Michael, him being the architect of her domain.

Past that, I've got nothing; best I can tell from the remaining show titles, a burrito is somehow important. Although, the ep. 13 title ""Somewhere Else"" has me itching to find out where this goes.


Edit: And time makes fools of us all.

Looks like my first two sentences hold, with some liberties taken with the second, but my timeline is shot to hell and I probably read way too much into the episode titles.I just spent over 30 minutes ""fighting"" a Sel'Nok infiltrator. He could barely damage me and my combat arts were just making my hands tired without accomplishing much so I just sat back, grabbed a bite to eat and watched the game play itself.

In the past, whenever they add some new stat or mechanic you'd die, a lot, while figuring out and gearing up to the new standard. With this it's just phenomenally boring and I don't even know what I'm missing.

I know this sounds whiny but I'm seriously confused here and this first impression fight left a 30+ minute taste of zero interactivity in my mouth.

Update: Multiple users are saying that this is a bug with the resolve system that will be resolved (no pun intended) in a hotfix Thur, Nov 17, 2016 (hello people from the future looking for insight on some other bug) or roughly 15 minutes from the time of this update. I'll update again to say whether the fix worked or not.

Update 2: Fights are still tedious with neither side doing much damage to the other. I really hope they didn't just fix one mob. Fortunately (if you're an optimist) there's another patch scheduled in an hour. That would be a mid-afternoon patch on the same day as a morning patch; something tells me they didn't quite shake all the bugs out in beta.

Update 3: Neither of the patches seem to have done much, at least for me. I have, however, been grinding gear by pure perseverance and just today I hit a Resolve level that changed the pace like someone hitting a switch. I'm at 91 Resolve now and my merc is at 17 (I converted loyalty to plat and set him up with Legendary Mastercrafted) and that brought our combined DPS from 400,000 yesterday to 5,000,000 today.

So... get your resolve up to play KA. As it stands, you need resolve to solo, whether the devs intended that or not.I'm a new rider that's going to take the test on a Kawasaki Concours 1000cc.

As the title asks, how screwed am I?

I've found the test descriptions on the [SC DMV manual](http://www.scdmvonline.com/dmvnew/forms/cycles.pdf) but it lacks dimensions for me to recreate and practice the tests. If anyone has that info it would be greatly appreciated.

The one that worries me the most is the S-curve cornering test since I have no idea how tight those corners are. The rest of the tests look like copies or variations of the Alternate M.O.S.T battery.

Edit, side note: I am a bigger guy so the weight ratio of me:Concours is about 1:2.3.

GreyyCardigan,4,6,"About a week ago my wife ordered three new swimsuits and a couple of sports bras for rounding out the summer as it's currently super hot where we live. Very proudly, she tried on all of her new items and made sure I gave my input. She looked amazing to me in all three swimsuits (of course) but it was one of the sports bras that especially caught my eye. I love her boobs, but there's something especially alluring to me about sports bras and this one was no exception. It was single strap, intended for use with a summer dress she already had. The strap sort of had a criss-cross webbing across the top for providing lift and support. She tried it on and we both, with wide eyes, immediately noticed that this bra accentuated her cleavage way more than anything else she's ever worn...like, comically so. She wore it proudly and smirked as I couldn't keep my hands off of her. Within 10 minutes she had ordered another.

Fast forward a week and I'm sitting bored at work, having powered through all morning. My mind starts to wander, and honestly, I had been fantasizing for the past week of her using the new bra to titfuck me given that titfucking is one of my biggest fetishes. It's just so hot to me, especially visually, and I couldn't stop imagining my cock being squeezed by her perfect, tight cleavage, like in this gif: [https://www.pornhub.com/gif/17571481](https://imgur.com/xdVyUJV)

We had been texting all day, so I decided to ask her, ""think you can use your new bra on me tonight? I've been fantasizing about it for a week."" She kindly obliged with a simple ""of course"" and then my impatient self started counting down the time.

She was working late, so I made sure to have everything ready for her when she got home so that she could just drop everything, eat dinner, and then relax a bit before the time came. I even lit a bunch of candles after cleaning up so that the whole house could gain some atmosphere and bit of a sexy scent.

So she comes in, sets down her various bags and keys on the table where I had a lavender candle lit. We debrief a bit about the day, she eats, and then we head back to the bedroom.

We both strip and she carefully puts on the sports bra that has had a meteoric rise to lingerie status. She spends a few seconds adjusting it in our full length mirror, making sure to get it just right. She spins around and looks incredible. Not only are her boobs bursting out but she looks radiantly beautiful as well despite a long day at work.

She lets me know she's going to massage my back first, so I lay on my front on the bed and she straddles me. I can feel the warmth of her pussy on my back as she rapidly rubs the coconut oil between her palms to warm it up. She proceeds to give me a very sensual massage with long, gliding movements of her hands, melting the stress of my day away.

After about 10 mins, she has me flip over so that she can massage both of my hands. Hand massages are amazing by the way if you spend most of your day typing, but I'm getting sidetracked. Anyways, once she was done with my hands she began to encircle my cock and balls with her hands in a teasing fashion.

At this point I was leaking so much precum as I was dying to have her touch my cock--but that's one of the best parts, isn't it? The anticipation? She eventually repositioned so that she was lounging on her side between my legs, head right above my cock. She began to gracefully rake her fingers over my frenulum as precum continued to dribble out: my cock twitching and weeping with pleasure from the teasing. She uses the precum as lube as she makes little circles on my frenulum with her thumbprint.

She then begins to run her tongue up and down my cock with the occasional swirl around the head of my cock before adding the playful pop of her lips right over the top, finishing with a sloppy kiss of the head. 5 minutes pass by of this: more tongue play, her pouty lips gliding over my cock head, and little sucking kisses of my frenulum (personal favorite move of hers). This whole time her tits are hanging right in front my cock--a foreboding of what's to come. At this point I had to have her back off because it was just too much. I was ready to pop from how turned on I was.

After such incredible buildup she raised up and asked if I wanted her to put my cock between her tits. I muttered a breathless 'yeah.' I remained laying down and she got on her knees and leaned over me, her big tits hovering over my cock. I already felt like I was going to last maybe 15 seconds because of how hot and bothered she had gotten me. She grabbed my cock, began to lift up her bra to slide me in, when suddenly...

\*BEEEP BEEP BEEEP ... BEEEP BEEP BEEEP ... BEEEP BEEP BEEEP\*

We both froze and gave each other a look like, ""what the hell is that?"" The noise was piercing and we didn't quite recognize it. As my swollen (but quickly shriveling) cock sit in my wife's hand I have a split second calculation run through my brain when I realize...THE CANDLES!

I sprang up and ran to the kitchen where the fire alarm was going off. As I'm running down the hall I'm praying it's just the candle and that I'm not going to run in to see my kitchen ablaze. I arrive, and to my horror, my wife's lunch bag had fallen over on top of the lavender candle. The bag was completely charred on top with a flame that was about the size of a volleyball. I made a quick decision to pickup the bag to remove it from the source fire of the candle. Like an idiot, I stood there in the kitchen, and two feet away from my sink, trying to blow the fire out. I only blew it twice before realizing how stupid I was and threw it in the sink, ran the water, and the flames almost immediately went out. As proof, here is a pic of the bag!: [https://imgur.com/0OvCEnx](https://imgur.com/0OvCEnx)

While that was going on, my wife decided to proactively open all the windows and the front door to let all the smoke out. Keep in mind, I'm half mast, partially covered in coconut oil, and if someone were walking their dog in front of our house (which occurs about every 15 mins), they would have easily been able to see me standing at the sink, completely nude. Given the intensity of the situation I didn't raise any complaints but calmly shut the door while leaving the windows open. We both began to laugh as she hugged me. ""I was literally about to have one of the greatest orgasms of my life"" I said to her as she began to laugh even harder. ""Don't worry, you'll get it back"" she responded.

After a couple of minutes pass we go back to bed. ""Do we need to start all over?"" she joked. We try to jump right back in where we were as she oils my cock up again and starts stroking me. Despite all the excitement and fear, I couldn't help but get almost immediately rock hard again in her hands. She leaned over, and I thrusted my cock between her tits. The mechanics are a bit awkward since we haven't done this much, but visually it still was super hot to me as my cock slid between her juicy tits. The head of my cock reappearing with every pump. It wasn't long before I busted and my cum glazed her gorgeous tits.

After she got up and went to the bathroom I hugged her and thanked her, mainly for being such a great wife who puts so much care and attention into my pleasure....but also for helping me avoid disaster.

The orgasm was great, but perhaps would have been even better if not interrupted by a near catastrophic house fire, but there's always next time.

I'll just have to be sure to use the electric, faux candle set we have. 😉

EDIT 1: My wife, u/owlshelveyourbook, was kind enough to provide a screenshot of the specific bra: [https://imgur.com/a/cC7RGX5](https://imgur.com/a/cC7RGX5)

Edit 2: images added of a bit of the action. 😉[Her](https://i.imgur.com/NcEajf2.jpg) and [Me](https://i.imgur.com/FvcEnvG.jpg)I really like my neighborhood, but I happen to be sandwiched between two of the most unkempt lawns/houses. One house is a young family with a dad that will mow for a few minutes maybe once a month before apparently giving up. I also think his lawnmower may not work very well.

The other neighbor is kind of odd and I don't think has any interest in lawn or home care. 

I really enjoy yardwork and I keep mine as clean as I can. I recently moved in and I've done a lot to improve my home's yard. We struggle with mosquitos and I think it would help if my neighbors would maintain their lawns. 

Would I be a jerk to ask to mow their lawns? It wouldn't really be a big burden to me and I've thought about low-balling them $15 a month or something just to cover my mower's gas but would honestly do it for free. 

Thanks

EDIT: Just pulled up to my house and one of the lawns is now cut. Lol"
badmonkey247,9,8,"Parts are amazing.

I have a part named Firehead.  He is young. He is Anger. 

I/my system used to act out explosively or thoughtlessly, or feel down about myself.  CBT helped me form strategies to keep myself and my relationships safe by responding differently, but of course Firehead still existed, beyond my understanding at the time.  Later I found IFS.

I worked with Firehead in the IFS way.  One thing he and I talked about was for him to find another way of signalling me that he had something to say, instead of prompting me to feel an impulse to act out.  He agreed and was happy and proud to be trusted with this Important Job.

My parents taught me to disregard my emotions and to stuff them down/deny them so I would ""Just Act Right and Don't Make Trouble, Dammit.""  As an adult I rarely feel emotions in my body, but I am really good at visualizing and conversing with my Parts.

This morning I woke up with troubles on my mind.  When I went for my morning cup of coffee I found I had botched up the set-up for the coffee maker so there was a mess of warm water and coffee grounds everywhere, and no coffee for me.

I felt sort of light-headed.  Almost dizzy. There was a hot light in my head.  At first I was scared and then I realized it was Firehead, finding a new way to message me.

My Anger part showed me what it's like to feel emotions in my body.  This is huge.

He and I connected visually and conversationally.  I told him how thankful I was and how proud I was of him finding a new way to connect, just like I asked him.  Then he agreed to step back and I walked the Trailheads to find the best actions/responses for the things I was angry about.

Just like a healthy grown up.
Holy shit.I picked up some packets of chicken noodle soup mix at a good price.  I made a quick soup using the mix and some leftovers as a simulation of how I might use the soup mix in a bugged-in type of situation.

Is it as good as my homemade soup or as convenient as  ramen?  No, but it's not bad at all for a pot of soup in under 30 minutes, and variety is a good thing, as is another way to use up leftovers.

I cut up a leftover chicken leg and threw in dry minced onions, celery (should have used dehydrated for a truer test, but didn't want to open a pack of it), dry parsley, chopped broccoli stalks, and two little carrots from my garden to simmer in 4 cups water for 20 minutes until tender.  Added the soup mix packet along with some dabs of cooked green peas and spinach and part of a can of mushrooms, and simmered 5 more minutes.I know  most of the recent troubles are due to an influx of new users.  Heck, I'm new (Francine, Vagrant).  It is tiresome to visit LDP only to see it filled with negativity, such as the bashing of Morgan Spiers and the ""impeach the mayor"" comments and threads.

Other than downvoting, is there a way we could strategize together to make it less appealing for the hateful people to post their garbage?I found some language my parts accept willingly.  To see if it might work for your system, please evaluate my recently discovered language for updating my parts about my current state of ability and adulthood.

When I tell my parts how old I am, sometimes it doesn't seem to land for them, or to affect their beliefs.  


I tell them I have my own little house now, and I do a good job of keeping it tidy, paying the bills for it, driving in my own car to bring in food and provisions for my house. 

I tell them I don't know everything and sometimes I'll make mistakes, but I 100% know that I know more than Mom ever did, so I can help them at least a little better than she ever did.  I tell them I want to help them as much as I can now, and make it at least a little better than it is now.

And when I get to know them better, and learn more about their suffering, I know how to learn more to help them more.  I can read about it, I can talk to my therapist about it, and I can watch videos by people who have already taught me some things, like learning how to find the part--- and we're talking now, and finding you and showing you I care about helping you is already more than Mom ever did.

It's very rambling to convey, but it's more ""elegant"" and concise when it happens in my head with a part activated as connection.My office space in the mudroom/laundry room is undergoing seven to 10 days worth of repairs by a 60-ish year old semi-retired carpenter. 

The carpenter acts like a child. When I need to excuse myself from one of his rambling conversations unrelated to his work, he'll act offended.  He's constantly teasing me about being a typical woman just itching to get to doing the laundry (which I can't do because of the repair work). Just now when I was outside with my laptop, he sprayed me with the garden hose.  If he had gotten my laptop wet, it could have been fried, but it wasn't funny even without the laptop. 

How on earth do I handle this?Recently I met a part who has something to do with procrastination.  She's 9 years old.  I asked her to step back so I could get some things done.  We agreed to dance together after I got some work done.  And we did.  I asked her what she did when she wasn't with me.  She said she sat on the floor and played Jacks, which is something I did often when I was her age (I'm older, so my childhood activities are old-fashioned).

Today I asked the part if she wanted to dance before I got started on a project.  She told me we'd dance after I got some of it done, lol.  I asked her what she'd do while I worked and she said she'd play Jacks.  I told her I also liked to play Marbles when I was her age.  She VERY firmly told me she liked Jacks, not Marbles.  And then she reminded me to come back to be with her, and not to forget about her.  I agreed, and followed through.

I believe she isn't the procrastinator part, but she has something to do with the pattern.  From Self, I looked for more info about procrastinating by gently probing into a memorable event which happened when I was the Jacks player's age.   I got hit with a sense of unworthiness that had a lot to do with the choice I made at the memorable event.  It didn't feel safe to nudge it more, so I made a promise to my inner world to come back to the event when it was okay to do so.

IFS is fascinating stuff, isn't it?So, I'm finishing up a sock.  Got all ready to do Kitchener Stitch--- cut the tail, threaded the needle, did the set-up move.  And then I was like, ""Wait a minute....""


They're toe-ups.

lolOh heavens.  I finished my Pi Shawl last night.  I now have ZERO WIP's.  I was already twitching slightly while pondering this fact.  

I scavenged, to no avail, in my stash, seeking inspiration and sufficient yardage for a pair of socks for my husband.  I figured he should get something nice while I was waiting for my shipment of worsted loveliness (estimated arrival: March 4), all of which is earmarked for selfish knitting--- two shawls and a cabled sweater for me, me, me.

I went to my laptop to calculate some gauges to see if I could cobble enough yarn together for bigfoot socks, and while I was there, I logged in to check on shipping status for the selfish yarn...

Beating the deadline, the package is now tracking as being out for delivery by my nice mailperson, who always drives up our driveway and honks at me when she delivers a package.  She should be here in an hour or two.  

And I looked up my order.  I added 200 g of fingering superwash sock twist to bump my order up to qualify for free shipping.  That's more than enough yarn to make a pair of big-footed socks for my darling.

I can already feel the twitching easing up.https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wk2yfu/ama_female_pirates/"
Paltenburg,6,5,"**WARNING:** Sony TV's from 2018 or earlier have higher input lag in 1080p! So in that case, don't use this tip (the A9 is excluded, check rtings for your specific model).

**Original post:**

This is for the situation where you play on a 4K screen, with a PS4 Pro and a game that uses an internal resolution of 1080p (or around that figure). This might be an old PS4 game, or a newer PS4 game in performance (= low resolution) mode.

By default, the PS4 Pro outputs a 4K signal, and if a game is on a lower resolution, it upscales the image to 4K. Ofcourse, by ""upscaling"" I don't mean something smart and modern like Nvidia's DLSS, but just stretching the 1080p image out over the 4K output-image.

But: If you set the output resolution of the PS4 Pro not on ""Automatic"", but you force it on ""1080p"", then the signal that's going to the tv is actually 1080p (How? In the PS4's system menu's go to: Settings -> Sound and Screen -> Video Output Settings -> Resolution, and set it to 1080p). Because your tv is a 4K screen, the tv itself is responsible for upscaling the 1080p image over the 4K screen.

**It might depend on your tv, but I've found that my LG Oled B6 from 2016 does a better job upscaling to 4k than the PS4 Pro. With the PS4 Pro on Automatic, edges and lines in the image are annoyingly ""jaggy"" or stairstepped (or however you wanna call it), but are much smoother when my tv does the upscaling.**

To demonstrate, I've made two examples of God of War, that I'm currently playing in 1080p mode. I've made photos with my phone, so ignore the color differences, but the differences in hard edges should be quite clear. The image is exactly the same, as it's a ps4-screenshot (but this is exactly how it looks in-game too). Also all the phone-photo's are sharp, because you can see the screendoor-effect of the tv's individual pixels.

&#x200B;

[More photo's of the scene above.](https://imgur.com/a/vfUPRfW) They're different photo's of the exact same image in both situations, to account for camera variations. With the B6-upscaling, the lines are smoother, but the rock textures look less detailed.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0tlkqxt1gr461.png?width=2648&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3208e6bb31bc2c4c97bbada12d46519170c01a

**But what about latency / extra input lag?**

Apparantly it's actually 16ms *faster* to set the Playstation to 1080p (and thus use the tv's upscaler instead of the playstations'). It might be that the pipeline of sending a 1080p signal from the console to the tv is somewhat faster.

Videos of the tests (more details in the descriptions):

*To clarify: these numbers of arond 100ms are the delay between a button press and screen action! The usual input lag numbers you know (of like 13ms or 30ms at most) are just the delay between the signal in the tv and the time that signal is displayed, without any console or controller involved. The input lag measurements here, of around 100ms, include the 30ms input lag of my tv.*

[Input lag: God Of War + PS4Pro (4K output) + LG B6. Filmed @ 240fps. Lag: 26 to 29 videoframes = 108-121ms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGMP4PI6MqU)

[Input lag: God Of War + PS4Pro (1080p output) + LG B6. Filmed @ 240fps. Lag: 22 to 25 videoframes = 92-104ms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qNp3Usa5UI)

This difference might be caused by the console and not the tv, because Rtings.com doesn't report large differences between 1080p and 4K for the tv (LG B6) alone:

>**1080p @ 60Hz**  27.6 ms  
>  
>**4k @ 60Hz**  27.8 ms  
>  
>**4k @ 60Hz + HDR**  28.5 ms

[https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/b6-oled#page-test-results](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/b6-oled#page-test-results)

For the record: around 100ms of delay between the press of a button and response on screen is normal and feels very snappy! The ps4 system menu's also are around these numbers (at least on my tv).

&#x200B;

**EDIT 2:** I have another theory why the 4K mode is slower: It is also HDR. And 4K HDR is only possible in YUV422. And YUV422 is a form of compression, requiring an encoding and a decoding step, which might make it the 16ms slower. The other mode is RGB which is the raw video data.

**EDIT 3:** It seems that Sony tv's from 2018 and earlier have higher input lag in 1080p (versus 4K)! So in those cases, don't use this tip! (The letter after the ""x"" in the model number denotes the year: H=2020, G=2019, F=2018, etc.). Samsungs and LG's don't have input lag differences between 1080p and 4K.I love this, found it out a few dayes ago. If you are interested in a game, and it is not on sale atm: 

On PSPrices.com each game has his own page where you can check how often and for how much a game usually goes on sale. It's the graph with the blue and yellow (for ps+) lines.

For example Uncharted 4:

-

Tormund: She (Ygritte) loved you, you know

Jon: Did she say that?

T: No, but all she talked about it how she wanted to kill you, that's how I know.

-

Ofcourse this is in regards to the conversation with the Hound about Brienne in last seasons' episode 6:

-

Hound: (paraphrasing:) How do you know she loves you?

Tormund: I noticed the way she looks at me

H: Like she wants to kill you?

T: You *do* know her!

Bill just refunding himself every week in Million Dollar Picks is setting the subconscious standard that there are not consequences for your gambling decisions. A lot of his younger listeners (teen culture audience) are internalizing that and are far more likely to irrationally bet in the future, thus some will eventually bankrupt themselves.  What we know what being broke in America, is that you dramatically limits your access to and quality of healthcare.  Thus, some will likely not be able to get the quality of medicine or preventative care needed to stay healthy. Quit killing out kids, Bill.

I can still send/receive mail, credentials I put in fail to work, if I ignore it it goes away for... well a little bit.

Went through a lot of troubleshooting trying to find out what is going on. Turns out for some reason Outlook is trying to connect to [outlook.office365.com](https://outlook.office365.com) (not where we have mail hosted). Throwing this registry key:

HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\16.0\\outlook\\autodiscover

DWORD: ExcludeExplicitO365Endpoint Value = 1

&#x200B;

Fixes it.

This should be Outlook asking Office 365 if they host my e-mail with them, this will always take priority (eg: ignores our domain's autodiscover settings), but if Office365 says ""nope not ours"" it shouldn't try to auth, but it's trying to auth (if I put in credentials and tell them to save, it saves ""[outlook.office365.com](https://outlook.office365.com)"" in my credential manager, this is how I noticed what is going on).

&#x200B;

I've had nothing but trouble *personally* with Office365 (I effectively can't use my domain with them due to them basically corrupting my login \[it ended up basically being ""email@[domain@domain.com](mailto:domain@domain.com)"" according to them, and I can't send reset e-mails to that address because it isn't real/valid, and they won't reset it for privacy reasons... crap\] and I've been through like 5+ phone calls with them through numerous departments and still need to do more). Now they're trying to hijack my Outlook, this is frustrating. I guess I'll go back to making a lot of phone calls with them trying to resolve this (again).

Also thanks for modifying e-mail headers in such a way that InvoiceCloud is getting a higher spam score than a fucking good chunk of my spam now (this wasn't the case months ago).

Anyway their customer service manager basically just sent me a fuck you e-mail on the delinquency charge, so who do I talk to next in the chain? I'm mainly pissed because Hixson Utility is the _only_ place here I've ever had a problem with automated and online payments being inconsistent as fuck (and the various platforms they've chosen over the years being absolutely awful to use), then dinging me for fees and wanting to _fight_ me on that as opposed to admit their system is shit.

I've burned more time having to call them and fix various issues then every other bill I pay added together. I think this is the most infuriating part of all. On top of that they charge additional fees to pay online just to put a cherry on top of the crap experience.

I thought that this was just a one time things so I played about another 10 or so matches and I'm still getting shit on. I've noticed that a lot of the players are of a higher level than what I was playing before this happened. Like players will sometimes be in the upper 70s and 80s, sometimes even lower 90s. I find it significantly harder to play in these lobbies because I was usually getting a 2-3-4kd in previous games, and capping the objective easier aswell. Now it seems like everyone is doing way better than me, now I'm struggling to keep a 1.5-2kd.

ThanosDidNothinWrong,10,4,"I know that it has to do with my microwave and rodents having the same radio frequency, but why would it cause that?I went to see the new spider-man movie today, and they were a bit slow cleaning the cinema from the previous showing (probably because of everyone sticking around for the post-credits scene), so a bunch of us were hanging out outside.

A guy with two kids walks up and says ""Are you waiting for Spider-man?"" one of the folks waiting says yes, and the dad says, ""Oh well, I'm sure he'll swing by soon.""

I gave him a nod of respect. Thought you guys would appreciate too.About 10 months ago (just going by reddit discussion age) Ross interviewed Roger Nygard about marriage, and a lot of people were unhappy with how it turned out. In response to feedback, Carrie said she would redo the interview as a control group. Did that ever happen, or was there ever any further response from them about whether they still support the views they uncritically platformed in that episode? Just seemed like an incident that never really got closure, and I'm curious as to whether I missed anything.I am writing a novel for nanowrimo but have no original ideas so I was really hoping the internet would write my novel for me. Tell me all your best ideas and if your lucky maybe they will go into a real novel :-) 

/uj Plz give me your best worldjerking ideas so I can steal them. 

/uj I am writing a novel for nanowrimo but am lacking inspiration, so I was hoping for a few thoughts that might spark something. I need a premise that is interesting enough to keep my attention for a month of concerted writing, but dumb enough that it's okay to throw it away on a nanowrimo novel. All ideas are welcome, from the sickeningly cliche to the way-out-there madness. Also I'm unlikely to straight up use one comment from here, more likely I'll mash several together or you'll remind me of some other completely separate idea.

All ideas are welcome :-)THAT is how to get me to enjoy poetry. Not forcing me to dissect poems for messages that likely aren't even intentional."
HappierMaple,10,9,"[removed]I was installing a software upgrade for him and came across a hidden folder. I opened it and saw that it was media so I figured it was porn so I opened it to see what he watches. Turns out it was video of him and his ex, naked, laughing, and doing the deed. I can't get the images out of my head. Should I tell him what I discovered or just leave it alone? Why would he keep stuff like this anyways?


tl;dr: found sex tapes of my bf and his ex. what should i do?And she told me to block her number. I miss my family so much. I don’t know what to do. It’s one thing to read about everyone’s story, but to actually talk to a person whose experienced it together in person. It felt so good. I hope she felt similar."
Psych0BoyJack,9,5,"Jesus christ, the shit i've seen in this sub.

I'll admit one thing, Ethan fucked up in a moment where youtubers are walking on thin ice, but to call him an hypocrite, a piece of shit  and other ridiculous things i've seen in the comments?

People from /r/all are coming into this sub, posting toxic shit, and the fanbase is just going along with their posts.
He made a mistake, apologized for it and removed the video. 
People are forgetting that this guy always have fought for the best of youtube despite all odds. Fupa, Ken Bone, Hugh Mungus, the racist shit and sexist shit on prank channels... and he makes this one slip up (a big one) and he's already the root of all evil.


the most ridiculous thing on this sub is people attacking him (out of nowhere) for not attacking JonTron. 
Jontron is a close friend of Ethan, if you think he should attack him for views and attention than you probably (and fortunately) don't have any friends, because at the slighest ""scent"" of trouble you would throw them under the bus. 
these are probably the same people who attacked him for making a video on his ""friend"" leafy, and now they are demanding a response on his **ACTUAL FRIEND** .


get a fucking grip, people.


edit: how some people are so up their own ass, that they mix me _""defending Ethan"" with me ""defending Jontron"" is beyond me. is it your only argument? to say that i agree with JonTron's views? oh my god...it's not even on the WWE youtube channel, or the WWE website. it's on the GERMAN WWE YOUTUBE.

ilikehockeyandguitar,7,7,When the Infinity War trailer played before Star Wars? I've watched it countless times now but it was still exciting seeing it on the big screen.
skyboundzuri,4,8,"I'm sure you've all heard this one before. I got bingo'd with it during an internet argument a couple of weeks ago. This was my reply:

""Honestly, I wish they had chose not to. Not that I regret my own life, but they really could have spared themselves a lot of misery. I am a product of a one night stand gone horribly wrong. My mother was a cook at Pizza Hut and my father was unemployed. My mom has only a high school education, my dad dropped out in the 9th grade. Both of their sets of parents forced them to get married when it came to light that my mother was pregnant. My dad walked out when I was four years old. My mother has a learning disability and wasn't smart enough to keep a job, and she trusted dangerous men throughout my childhood. She got government assistance to supplement her intermittent minimum wage income sources from the day I was born and will likely continue to do so until my youngest brother turns 18 in 3 years. That's 26 years of taxpayers bearing the burden of mine and my siblings' existence instead of simply wearing a goddamn condom.

I don't resent my own life, but I can say with absolute firmness that my parents should have thought twice about having kids. I'm 23. Half of my friends from high school have kids by now, and about half of that group is headed down the same road as my mother. It is unthinkable that you would wish a life like that on someone by implying that they should have children simply because their parents did."""
lookmafireworks,9,6,"I just caught up with Godard's 'Breathless' and I'm stuck like I get with a lot of older films. I feel like I missed the boat but it was really hard to get through. I've read some articles that give me a better look and thought of it but it felt to me less like a movie that's a story and more a statement from Godard against the frivolity of American cinema. What's your take?Curious as to what everyone here thinks about retaining #61 at years end.Plug Spooner back in? Or put someone else at Center and bring back Beleskey?So I'm almost finished and if the answer ruins the ending tell me to keep reading:

I'm right at the part where Bill and Beverly, post Library meeting, go back to the motel for sex. They are about to have sex or just finish and she mentions that she ""made love to them all"". And he mentions ""That's how you got out"". Did I miss something here?

Does this get explained/WTF? 

UPDATE: just finished. What. The. Fuck. Does anyone else feel like that scene is totally out of place and kind of ruins how you feel for the characters? Ending was great in a lot of ways but felt rushed compared to the intricate and incredible storytelling that leads up to it.

I almost wanted to say that if I had to read a scene where THAT happens, tell me to stop. Quite uncomfortable.

Credit to /u/FOOTBALL_GIF_MAESTRO for the gifsI noticed that I enjoyed my internships where I was on a team with at least one other intern. It was nice to have someone to talk about my thought process without the worry of disturbing full time engineers who are doing more important work. 

When I hit a roadblock, I found it easy to walk over to the other intern's desk and talk it out, and if we didn't manage to solve it, then we would go to our supervising engineer. 

More than that, it's comforting to have someone who also is new to software engineering in the workplace as much as you are, so you can relate to them better than full time workers. It's also a nice way of making friends over the course of your internship.

Just my 2¢He replied ""Let me put it this way""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=botE9GacA10

This is a guided meditation associated with a Tree. I think his videos are still a bit cut and dry, but he taps into some really good aspects of meditation. I think he deserves more than the exposure he currently gets. His passion for meditation was evident in classes - he would often make time within classes to have group meditations with an 'empathy' mindset to help students understand emotions associated with events in the course. 

He also brought Kevin Pearce (former snowboarder, suffered traumatic injury and now runs a meditation organization designed to promote meditation) and it was really educational, and contributed to my passion for this art. http://www.loveyourbrain.com is the organization which helps those suffering with TBIs, you might've heard of them already but its worth a look :) 

Thanks for your time...I'm seeing a lot of repeat questions on the interview discussions thread about a list of companies like MS, GS, Bloomberg, etc. I think these comments should be consolidated into megathreads that are pinned onto the sidebar for the season.

Moreover for people super concerned about stuff like this, they can refer to one simple thread to ask questions."

lapsed_,4,7,"I get that anonymity is a factor, there's no real consequence that results from being a total jerk.  I just can't understand *why* people would want to pursue it though, when it's easy enough to ignore something they disagree with or find stupid.Pedophilia is a mental illness, which means they have to acknowledge that fact and be responsible about how they respond, act, and choose what situations they place themselves in.

If a pedophile places themselves in situations that make it more easy for them to feel impulse to act on urges, they're to blame for their own stupidity and deserve no sympathy.

No matter how special or smart you think you are, you can't hide from accountability or consequence.  If somebody hurts or molests a child because of their mental illness, they deserve worse then prison.  They deserve their head on the chopping block and all the abuse that rightfully follows them in prison.

I feel bad for people that legitimately understand they are sick and do what they can to prevent themselves from feeling impulses and horrible thoughts.  I hope those people get the help they need and feel support for the effort they put into keeping themselves and others safe."
kiwi-lime_Pi,4,2,"Trump is already very unpopular and his base is not going to abandon him over something like this, so he really has nothing to lose. It's something the US should have done a long time ago, but I assume nobody has ever had enough political capital. Trump has the opposite, nowhere to go but up. He should embrace the roll of America's garbage man President and just do all the things that nobody else could accomplish because of fear of political retribution. 

*edit: can you think of anything else that a ""garbage man"" President could accomplish, i.e. relatively a-political tasks that would be normally difficult to achieve because changing the status quo is never popular?"

prolapsediving,3,4,"Today a buddy of mine called me up and told me he gotten me a gift and that we should get dinner; he brought his girlfriend, who'd dated for a while and am still friends with. We go to the outdoor patio of a coffee place and he shows me the gift: a pipe, some tobacco and matches. 

While he's showing me to smoke the pipe, his girlfriend mentions that she occasionally smokes cigarettes, and he's bewildered because she'd told him she didn't like smoking. She says that she doesn't, but she's mainly a social smoker. He gets mad that she lied to him, and they leave a few minutes later. I stay for a bit, finish the tobacco that's in the pipe, and leave.

Getting into my car, I get a call from him. He'd said that they might come back later, so this isn't *too* unexpected. I answer, and he asks me where I am in a panicked voice. He sounds like he's freaking out, and I'm thinking that they've broken up or something. I tell him to calm down and tell me what's up, he screams into the phone, breathes a bit, and then says that he's got a dead body in the car. That they started arguing and he stabbed her.

At this point, I start panicking. Telling him that he fucked up, that I don't know what the fuck to do, this whole time I'm asking him if he's fucking with he or not, he insists that he's serious. After a good five minutes, he starts laughing. It was a joke, she's there with him, the patched things up.

I call him a dick, laugh a bit, and tell him that I was literally a couple seconds from hanging up and calling the cops. At this point he gets mad that I wasn't gonna help him get rid of the body, says that he would have helped me, etc. Even *she* takes his side, insisting that she ""wouldn't want revenge if he did kill her"" and that calling the police would make me ""a dick and a pussy at the same time."" He sounds like he's honestly hurt and betrayed.

I'm bewildered right now. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they were pulling another one. But just in case; am I the asshole?It just gets better from here, y'all! Feels good right now.The Louisiana Futurist Party is the state branch of the United States Futurist Party, which seeks to provide an alternative to the current parties that have repeatedly stonewalled true progress for our nation. 

Our platform stands on the principles of education reform, economic liberty through Universal Basic Income, and advancement of science, technology and space exploration. Everyone here knows that this state has struggled for quite some time with a lackluster education system and, in many areas, with poverty that doesn’t have to exist in this day and age.

The FP will achieve lasting education reform and allow access to academic works and sources for all, while replacing the cluttered system of welfare that penalizes those who work with a Universal Basic Income that ensures all citizens will have access to adequate food, clothing, shelter, and other basic needs. We operate on a decentralized model with an emphasis on openness and transparency; anybody can suggest an idea or debate on one. 

The national party's subreddit, /r/futuristparty, is relatively active and populated, but /r/LouisianaFP has only recently started up and we are working on getting some good content going; we’d love to see you in both! If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here.Despite what you say, I can't help but feel like you left me for him, you say it would've just been someone else down the line, you didn't leave me for him, you left me because you were capable of feeling anything for anyone else to begin with. Yeah, that's bullshit. Because you've talked about getting together in the future and you know the only reason you're hesitating is because his ex, your best friend, would be devastated. But you were willing to break me into a million pieces to be happy, why not her? Why stop now?

And then you have the nerve to ask if I think he's lesser than me. Truth be told, I hate him and I think he's scum. Not because he barely graduated high school, no. Not because he lives in a trailer and works at Circle K. No, it's because he's the reason I'm miserable right now. He sowed the seeds of doubt when he came to you crying because his now ex wasn't emotionally unavailable. And you had an emotional affair, I realize it now. You say he just ""gets you better"" and that he's more like you and that's why.

Fuck you. I gave you everything. I gave up my dream school for you. I wish I could hate you as much as I hate him right now because I'd be happier. But I can't. Because I love you. I always will.

So...do I wear a suit? It's an online interview and I have literally no idea how this works. Does anyone have any pointers?Nothing lasts forever.

Until then, we're going away. We're going to hide. The open isn't safe.I was checking the bunker out by the farmhouse and I found some crazy shit in there. Looked like it was some kind of prepper bunker, which I expected, but there was lab equipment in there and a couple skeletons in lab coats with pistols by their hands, and the skulls had holes. Smelled awful in there.

I read over some notes they had. I haven't gone over them entirely but I think they had something to do with the virus. There's a bunch of sealed vials and shit with something in there, which I decided not to touch with a ten foot pole. I'll study the notes further and see what I can figure out."

Karnatil,2,10,"I have the Humble Monthly Bundle, which is giving out copies of Assassin's Creed: Origins on **Uplay**. Unfortunately, I believe that these keys are region-locked, so enter the giveaway at your own risk. My region is **United Kingdom**.

Post an integer, and I will randomly select one at the conclusion of the giveaway.

Congratulations to u/greatestname for winning this giveaway!I don't know if it applies to anything other versions of the patch notes, but the [NA patch notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-65-notes#patch-soraka) and the [EUW patch notes](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-65-notes#patch-soraka) have slightly different values for Soraka's new Rejuvenation buff. It may be worth double-checking values in game if you're going to be theorycrafting or crunching numbers based on this information. At the moment, it seems the NA patch notes are correct."

I hope every Cubone I traded today has a great home; enjoy the no-recoil Flare Blitz!So I have just finished maxing out the IQ on my Pachirisu, who gets Nature Gifter. I had eaten a couple berries and seeds with it when I had this crazy idea: If I have two Pokémon with Nature Gifter, and a third one with Pierce Hurler or a respective item for the same effect, can I pierce both Nature Gifter Pokémon to give everyone x2 the effect of the item? This would make leveling up with Golden Seeds a breeze with 10-15 levels a seed.Hi everyone,

I've been looking for a way to RNG a Croagunk in Platinum that is holding Black Sludge (5%). However, I can't find any posts related to hold item RNG. I feel like there should be a reliable way to do this; after all, it's used in speedruns of the game. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

**Edit**: So I did some digging and came across [this thread](http://tasvideos.org/GameResources/GBx/Pokemon/RNG.html) that talked about RNG in Ruby and Sapphire. I'm playing Platinum, but it appears that this still applies. Under the ""Wild encounter hold item (Ruby/Sapphire)"" section, they talk about how the wild hold item is determined by the Pokémon's PID. When I finally frisked this Croagunk holding Black Sludge, I dumped my save file to find this:

Seed - 950B09A7

Frame - 146

PID - 53D58408

The guide on TASVideos said that the item hold percentage is determined by PID modulo 100. You then find the probability of your target Pokémon holding the item (either 50% or 5%; 60% or 20% with Compoundeyes respectively). You can find this on sites like Serebii.net as an example. Now take that percentage, and subtract it from 100. In my case, Croagunk holds Black Sludge 5% of the time. So 100 - 5 = 95. Now, this means that only 5% of generated Croagunks will hold this item. So in my case, I found a Croagunk with a PID of 53D58408. When you do 53D58408 modulo 100, you end up with 96. Luckily for me, 96 falls under the category of being >= 95. So basically, if you are looking for a 5% item, the remainder after PID modulo 100 must be 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99.

I hope others find this post useful!"

3D Touch to open to a new tab on the home screen is an absolute lifesaver. I'm sure it's happened to all of us, when you're searching for something to show a colleague or family member and you hit the Safari icon and BANG! They see the website you were looking at last night/this morning which you forgot to close down.

I've got into the habit of ALWAYS opening Safari this way as it is also a genuine time saver. I hope you appreciate this LPT as it has helped me out on a number of occasions and has saved me from desperately smashing at my home button to clear the screen on more than one occasion.I've had my AirPods since day 1 in the UK and I've literally NEVER seen anyone else with a pair in like nearly 2 months. haha

Have you?

I feel so *exclusive*.On macOS, you can type your reminder and add on ""tomorrow 3pm"" (for example) and it will be diarised accordingly. I've been using this feature for years and I've found it to be very efficient and well implemented.

If Apple can port this to iOS, it would be a massive improving for reminder hoarders such as myself. It would also save the hassle of setting the time via the stock slot machine interface.I'm in a good habit of always peeking Instagram posts as opposed to opening them on the basis that you can't accidently double tap and like a post from 2014.

The photo is exactly the same size when peeking anyway and you get to skip all of the (usually) boring caption/hashtag crap.Apple have given us the option to order our keyboards within Settings, although tapping the globe symbol to switch will often jumble this order when swapping between multiple kboards.

This has been irritating me for well over year and was present in iOS 10 as well as 11.

[comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6mu5ev/comment/dk6v4e0?st=J53IJ5CK&sh=8df63e04)I'm a subscriber to both AM and Spotify and one thing I've always had issue with is how Apple removed their 'add to Up Next' feature when they redesigned the whole app's UI with iOS 10 (I believe).

Am I the only person who's noticed this?

I know it's just my particular use case, but it used to work wherein your Up Next queue was prioritised before the remainder of the album/playlist. Spotify's queuing system still works this way which in my opinion is much more conducive to on the fly listening, although it doesn't have any Play Next function."
9589Smith,4,1,"Greeting SO30. [35M] My dick can be fickle. I am always excited to have sex and I am attracted to a wide range of women by ethnicities and body types. My emotions have always influenced my erections since I started having sex. Recently, I noticed that my erection fades away with some women but not others. This issue is troubling me because I feel like I failed my partner when by dick decides to take a few minutes off. I compensate with oral and fingers to get her off. My erection returns, but I am surprise to feel my dick fade away while in her vagina. 

Have any of you experienced this phenomenon directly or indirectly? 

I exercise with cardio and resistance training for an hour five days a week. I eat healthy and I do not abuse any substances. I may check with my MD if I continue to fade during sex. I hope that this issue will fade, but I realize that I am getting older and change happens.Greetings all,

I [S35M] do not feel like a good catch at the moment and I do not want to ghost or be ghosted upon anymore. I have removed Tinder, Bumble, Zoosk, and OKC from my phone and deactivated the accounts. I went on dates from each of the four dating services but none of the budding relationships lasted longer than a month. I had one that I thought would be more, but she ghosted me after 3 dates &amp; 2 nights of sex. That sucked, but I moved on. 

I am suspending my dating activities to focus on myself first. I have six red flags that work against me in find a quality match. They are:
1) Divorced single dad [6m] with ex-wife drama [court, geographical restriction, confusing possession time].
2) $55K in student loan debt without a full engineering degree. I divorced my ex-wife during my last semester and failed two senior level classes required for graduating in 2012 after matriculating into engineering in 2004. [Full-time work Part-time student].
3) I live with my parents because I was irresponsible with my money. I traveled for work for 2 years (2013-2014). I paid rent for a unit that I only visited for 5 days and returned to traveling for 6-8 weeks. I sought out prostitutes versus developing a meaningful healthy relationship with a woman and sunk a lot of money into one night stands. 
4) I live in Texas where religion is big and I turned into a nonbeliever. 
5) I develop social anxiety with long term relationships. I routinely ghost on friends after a year of friendship.
6) Without my intentions, I have become the glue that holds my family together in one house (mom [64], dad [65], brother [41], uncle [62]). It sucks as much as you can imagine.

Luckily, I have made progress in bettering myself. I have curbed my prostitution problem through therapy. My bank account is happier. I have paid off one of five debts by following Dave Ramsey's plan and will be done with debt two of five in mid-August. I suspect that I will be able to afford a small 2-BR condo in a safe neighborhood for me and my son in two to three years if I do not move out sooner to maintain my mental health from my family. (Not that they are bad or abusive, it's just that I am tired of being around the same people.) I manage my depression and anxiety with medication as well as by participating in Debtors Anonymous, Sex Addicts Anonymous, Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. I take medication to level out my depression and anxiety. I have a great relationship with my son [6]. I coached his soccer team for the past three years, participate in his school activities, and support his interests as he learns about the world around him. 

Unfortunately or Fortunately, before I cut off the dating sites one woman [S30F] [aka MsV] responded to my inquiry for a chat and we met last Sunday after flirting online for two weeks. If she ghosts me after learning more about me or for any reason, I would be okay. I have my goals to accomplish first before forcing a romantic relationship. The prospect of being 40+ single in a small condo finishing my degree while my son chooses to live with me is not as frightening as being 40+ living with my parents as a co-owner care-taker to their geriatric needs.

Have you suspended your dating efforts for any reason? Do you believe that doing so helped you appreciate yourself? Or, do you believe that you missed an opportunity because you said ""No thanks. I do not feel ready for any kind of relationship?

All comments welcome.

TLDR: Why I suspended my dating activities: I am focusing on improving myself before seeking or forcing a relationship to advance a change of lifestyle. Have you done something similar?Just looking to see who else is interested in the opera. [35M]http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/operation-no-pay-may-a-houston-woman-attempts-31-dates-in-31-days-8437207

The writes of this Houston Press article went on a first date with a different man each day during the month of May. 

What struck me was that she lamented about receiving texts from her chosen guy of the day before and after that guy's schedule date with her. She stressed towards the end that she ran into two type of guys via online dating: those wanting to shag and those want to date long term. Both type of guys moved too fast for her comfort.

What pace is a good pace for online dating and courtship? How much communication is too much?

I suspect that different ethnicities and different personality types will have different answers. So every answer and opinion is valid and welcomed.I committed to helping a friend move to Jacksonville. For a few days I'll be a tourist in Jacksonville.

mushoo,1,2,"I'm rewatching (slowly) all of Fringe with a friend who's never seen it before.  Tonight we got to White Tulip.  SO MUCH of this episode is relevant to The End of All Things - particularly how time travel works.  Every time Peck goes back in time, he is NOT creating alternate realities from it - he is overwriting.  The episode makes that very clear.

I posit that the Observers' time travel tech must work similarly. A) Whenever Peck goes back, he replaces himself - there is no copy of him there to meet.  Which means that he can't cross into his own timeline without changing things. B) Peck (and Walter) specifically say that when they change the past, the 'new' future replaces the 'old' one.  At the end of the episode, nobody on the train has died, the Fringe team isn't investigating a case anymore, and nobody has any memory of Peck being anything more than someone who died in a car accident with his fiancee. (Though why nobody noticed he's now a cyborg I donno).

C) In one of the timeline revisions, the 'second' one that we see, Olivia has deja vu when looking at Peck's MIT diploma in astrophysics. Peter says something along the lines of ""Deja vu is fate's way of telling you you are where you should be.""

Thoughts? I'm thinking Peter is exactly 'where' he needs to be - he's in the wrong 'when.' He IS home, just someone did a lot of redecorating.Am I the only one that's tired of the damned 'board porn'?  I honestly don't give a rats ass about pictures of mixing consoles.

Make a new boardporn subreddit if you want to look at consoles.Anyone else having trouble with RTA now? I keep getting 'Network connection failed' errors. Got in about 5 battles and now... nothing."

It had been two years. Two years since they heard us. Two years since they contacted us, demanding tribute. Two years since our answer.

No. It was simple answer, but one that had not been given to them in millenia. And they acted like they didn't understand. They showed up a week later, to collect. They weren't expecting resistance, and so under the might of a thousand nukes the size of the Tsar Bomba, their fleet turned into radioactive slag. The Chinese Hyper-Ship claimed victory for that one. 

There was one ship of that fleet that survived. We reverse-engineered it, top to bottom. Sure, some of it was pretty well known, a thin water shell combined with a magnetic shield kept out most radiation. But there was other bits that provided much needed technology.

Most importantly, the HELL-NO Drive. The long name was High Electromagnetic Low Level Near Observation, which basically meant worked on an extension of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. By observing an object's location and speed, you can forget your own. By forgetting your own, you can appear anywhere you want, going as fast as you want. There was some nuance to this, but that was the basics of it. 

The first ship to be fitted with this was an experimental fighter, code named “Lee-G Mk. 01”. Coated in a highly reflective orange and marked in several places with it's identification code, it was fast. Faster than light, quicker than tachyons, it was a causality destroyer. The pilot who flew the vast majority of experimental craft was given the Mk. 1 to test. That went real well.

After a misadventure involving the pilot, some bio-nanites, and the cockpit of the Mk. 1, a new and improved drive was fitted to the asteroid Alpha-Zero. That became the basis for a new drive, a better drive than the one used by them for thousands of years. 

It was called the FUCK-NO Drive, the Filtered Unionized Crash-preventative K-Band Near Observation Drive. It basically was a HELL-NO, but it was much safer, faster, and thanks to the usage of the K-Band, lighter and more efficient. 

Well in theory it was safer, not really. But FUCK-NO was still much, much more powerful than HELL-NO.

Of all the crowning technological achievements of the Humans, the FUCK-NO drive was the most revolutionary. 

All of this development took only two years to complete. Just two years to break millenia of technological stagnation. It told us something, yelled it more like, but we were too stupid to listen. Always too stupid, never visionary enough. Of all the galaxy, only one species was simultaneously stupid to toy with them, and smart enough to get away with it. I recently came across [The Last Man on Earth](https://chyoa.com/story/The-Last-Man-on-Earth.6865) and [The Only Guy In Earth](https://chyoa.com/story/the-only-guy-on-earth.4059) and I was wondering what's out there. And, yes, I read the sidebar, those are all good too!I checked if I could vote today, after registering and voting in the republican primary, and now I'm not registered to vote. I only registered a few months ago, is this normal?

* Every Sunday! 4:30pm start time, three rounds  
* Payout by record - 8 prize packs to 3-0, 6 packs to 2-0-1, and 4 prize packs to 2-1. You can also turn 4 prize packs into a pass to play for free the next event you attend!

You could get potentially get a Nintendo switch for $180+tax after cash back(visa gift card)

**Step 1** - From Samsung Pay purchase $100 Overstock gift card(daily limit per account) - $80

**Step 2(optional/need 2 accounts with Samsung Pay)** - From 2 other accounts send $100 Overstock to your email - $80~$160

**Step 3** - Purchase Nintendo Switch from Overstock IN Samsung Pay App - $0~$200

You end up paying $240~$280(plus tax) depending on how many Samsung Pay accounts you have. And you get $60 cashback on Samsung Pay for the purchase~ bringing the total(after cashback) to around $180~$220(plus tax). 

I was able to help a friend get his switch + $60 cashback  for $260

Seems like a hassle but probably the best deal you can get post Black Friday. Good luck!

Hello Sysadmins! I have the pleasure of setting up VPN for a company and gone through most of the steps of setting up Basic VPN without that Direct Access schnazzy feature. The server has Routing and Remote Access enabled. The networks DHCP is set up on Cradlepoint MBR1200. I have Allowed Remote access on the Windows firewall, and I believe I forwarded the right ports on Cradlepoint under Advanced > Gaming option (1723, 1701). Also have an account with remote access allowed and dial-in allowed. Let me know if I missed a step from here but I was pretty thorough.

Whenever I try to connect to this from an external network I get a general error 800 on the computer trying to vpn in. On the server I kick a rasman error:

 ""A connection between the VPN server and the VPN client xx.xx.xx.xx has been established, but the VPN connection cannot be completed. The most common cause for this is that a firewall or router between the VPN server and the VPN client is not configured to allow Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) packets (protocol 47).""

I googled this issue and it was telling me to open up more ports on the router like 500, 4500 (for L2TP?) 

Has anyone come across this error? I'm pretty sure I got the Cradlepoint set up correctly otherwise the server wouldn't kick that error (I could be wrong). So it might be something I'm missing on the server side. Thank you ahead of time!

//EDIT Are there any common VPN settings that plebs(me) would overlook?"

PaleBlueEye,2,7,"Like heroin.I'm an hour and a half in and I think the effects are peaking, and I am pissed that this will probably be a scheduled substance soon.   I was in full-blown, ""I wanna cut my leg off above the knee pain"" before I dosed and now I can barely feel the pain.   I could cry in relief right about now.   No more acetaminophen ruining my liver, no more going to the doctor and being treated like a junkie, no more intolerable pain.   I would have tried this sooner but I wrote it off as a junky herbal high as so many of the legal herbal drugs tend to be.


I think I need to stockpile and figure out how to do an extraction so if it does become illegal I won't have distribution charges if my stash gets found.   A vial of very potent extract is probably going to be a far lesser charge than pounds of leaf.   Not sure what my options are yet here, but I'll figure it out eventually.

Sproded,8,10,"As I'm sure most are aware, after the tragic killing of George Floyd, our lame-duck student body President Jael decided to put out an emotion-filled statement demanding action involving ceasing all relations with the Minneapolis PD without any discussion and even shot down the notion of discussion. Throughout the statement, she acts like ""we"" the student body are all in support of her when 99% of us haven't even seen the letter and a large number of us aren't in support of it. As our student body President you should know better than to pretend to represent the entire student body without any discussion. To make matters worse, MSA then [tweets](https://twitter.com/msaUMN/status/1265670080358203392?s=20) that ""she will NOT be responding to comments, emails, or additional communication"". That's the worst thing someone who is suppose to represent us can do.

Her main job as student body President from the MSA's constitution is to be the ""[primary spokesperson for the undergraduate student body](https://www.msa.umn.edu/important-documents)"". How can she be our spokesperson if she takes actions without taking input from the general student body and refuses to respond to anyone's questions or comments after. MSA often claims they are ""advocating for all students"" and that they represent undergrads at the U but I don't see how either of those are true if the President makes statements without giving all undergrads the opportunity to give input and refuses to respond to any questions/complaints students might have because of her statement. The end result is we have a student body President claiming to represent all of us while refusing to listen to most of us and going against what a sizable portion of our student body cares about if the other Reddit thread is any indication. Jael, just because your replacement has already been elected doesn't mean you get to pretend you represent the student body while refusing any discussion and fail to perform your duty.

In the end, this will just be the nail in the coffin for a student body President administration marred by inadequate leadership and controversy. In case you forgot, many members were speaking out against inadequate leadership back in October and the previous President resigned in December. I hope next year brings about some much needed change in the leadership.I've seen lots of posts around here recently linking to these so-called ""easy scholarships"" where all you have to do is provide an e-mail address and maybe a mailing address. These are no different than a sweepstakes you find on a bottle of Coke. Why would someone who is trying to improve their community want to give a scholarship away to a random person without knowing who they are? 

Also, many of the links here are just trying to gain referrals. If you need to share a scholarship with other people in order to win, it's not a scholarship. And if you think you can make a quick buck by tricking other people in to signing up, you should reconsider that decision. If Minnesota managed to beat TCU how would it effect them and the Big Ten this Season.Their defense is probably one of the best in the BIG 10 yet their offense only scored 10 points against Kent State. If their offense can't find a way to score, how far will their defense carry them."

lumos_solem,2,1,"Noch nicht mal über die Grenze drüber, hat sich schon ein Wappler gefunden der gleich mal das ganze Programm abspielt: Lichthupe, drängeln, auffahren bis man nicht mal mehr ihr Kennzeichen im Spiegel sieht, dann rechts überholen (weil mein Mann mal wieder genau das Gegenteil macht was man von ihm will, schön wenns mal wen anderen trifft haha) , schön untermalt von ein paar freundlichen Gesten. Und das alles bei 80er bzw dann 60er Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung.

Was micht zu meiner ursprünglichen Frage bringt, wer hat diesen brunzdeppaden Möchtegern-Machos mit Auto-Schwanzverlängerung eigentlich so dermaßen ins Hirn gschissen?!

Edit: weils so viel Diskussion drum gab und es vlt einige interessieren könnte (soll jetzt nicht die Diskussion noch mehr anheizen, wir waren nur selbst dann auch neugierig), hier was der ÖAMTC zum Rechtsfahrgebot schreibt:

Auf den rechten Fahrstreifen muss immer dann gewechselt werden, wenn dieser über eine größere Distanz (ca. 300 bis 400 m) frei ist. Der mittlere bzw. linke Fahrstreifen darf auf Autobahnen überhaupt nur in zwei Fällen benützt werden: beim Überholen und beim zulässigen Nebeneinanderfahren. Letzteres liegt vor, „wenn es die Leichtigkeit und Flüssigkeit des Verkehrs fordert“, also in der Regel nur bei dichtem Verkehr. Überall diskutierens jetzt als wäre Omikron das Ende der Pandemie, weils ja weniger tödlich sein soll. Allerdings ist alles was ich über diese Variante höre alles andere als beruhigend. Ja es ist wohl weniger tödlich, aber dafür ansteckender. Dh es werden wohl genauso viele wenn nicht sogar mehr Menschen gleichzeitig ins Krankenhaus müssen weil die absoluten Zahlen steigen werden. Und weniger tödlich heißt ja auch nur weniger tödlich als Delta, aber es ist doch immer noch ähnlich tödlich wie Alpha. Das kommt mir eher wie ein Gewöhnungseffekt vor als tatsächliche Entwarnung. Und wenn es dann auch noch stimmt dass Omikron kürzere Inkubtionszeiten hat, also noch weniger Zeit bleibt Kontakte vor einer möglichen Ansteckung zu warnen, wird es noch schwerer die Ansteckungsketten zu unterbrechen.

Klärt mich gerne auf wenn ich wo falsch liege, aber ich frag mich wirklich, ob das ein Argument sein kann die Impffplicht auszuhebeln oder sowas wie Entwarnung zu geben. Für mich klingt das nicht so."
hbgoddard,6,6,"The thought occurred to me that this would be a very natural way to finally implement pigmen in vanilla! All of these things would fit perfectly with what's already implemented:

* Pigmen could inhabit fortresses just like testificates inhabit villages

* Zombie pigmen could attack fortresses and infect pigmen just like zombies do in the overworld

* Pigmen would trade with the player, offering rare items or Nether exclusive trades (such as Nether wart, blaze rods, magma cream, soul sand, etc.)

* Ruby ore could be implemented (it's already in the code somewhat) to be used with pigmen instead of emeralds

* Ruby could even be a rare Nether-exclusive ore (The first of its kind!)

* We could finally get pigmen NPC communities, just like Notch first promised! The person who first suggested pigmen could also finally have his idea realized in game!

I'm not pushing for this to be added right away, but it's a really neat concept that could make the Nether just as dynamic as the overworld. I don't imagine this being too hard to implement, as all they would have to do is reuse code from how testificates work. So, what does the community think?

**TL;DR** Pigmen could inhabit Nether fortresses and zombie pigmen and pigmen could interact like zombies and testificates."
qwerto14,2,5,"I've run into this twice recently, where downloading games will say ""Ready to play"", and will then take you to their own install screen with prettier pictures. GTA and Fallout 4 both do this, and I'm sure other games do as well. Battlefield 4 did it correctly, as I was able to start playing the campaign. Giving the notification when no actual gameplay is available feels a little deceitful, and is at the very least frustrating.Striker: You punch things. Sometimes you jump up in the air and use two hands to punch things. This works well and raises the question of why someone wouldn't always use two hands to punch things. Sometimes you punch things with your shoulder. Sometimes you punch things with your knee. Occasionally you punch things with bullets, but this punching is the least effective punching of all the punches. Punching things so much makes your fists dirty, so get a nice rag on your waist so you can punch the dirt off of your punches.

Defender: Instead of using two hands to punch things, you use a shield to make other things stop punching you. This is counter-intuitive because it doesn't allow you to punch as many things. You can still punch with bullets, and sometimes the shield makes it so you punch harder with bullets. Sometimes the shield makes a little shield so you can run around punching things and not getting punched as much. Sometimes when you punch things you get a shield that lets you punch more things. Dishrag is maintained.

Edit: I'm not exactly sure what to do with these gold punching bags, they seem pretty inefficient.

Edit 2: Apparently, the shield punchers are feeling unappreciated. Make no mistake, you guys punch just as much and as hard as the rest of us. Don't let my personal punching preference get you down, the puncherdome is as useful as it is shiny.I spent upwards of 30 minutes just trying to beat the boss, and ended up quitting.

kerouacrimbaud,3,10,"Very early on in the chapter “The Departure of Boromir,” Aragorn laments that *‘All that I do goes amiss.’*

Also, very early in the chapter “The Taming of Sméagol,” Frodo similarly decries that *‘All my choices have proved ill.’*

These lines both set up a central struggle for both characters to endure in their respective books: deciding, most importantly to both Frodo and Aragorn, for your companions, which peril to march towards.

[Twitter link](https://twitter.com/GibbonsDillan/status/1391912418977230850?s=20)[From his Twitter](https://twitter.com/lane_kiffin/status/1205189868894277632)I recently came across a pair of opinion pieces in Politico that each made a case [for](https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-fake-news-law-will-protect-democracy/) and [against](https://www.politico.eu/pro/macron-fake-news-law-will-threaten-democracy/) this new law.  

How are these new measures shaped by French concepts of free expression and press freedoms both in a historical context and in a contemporary one?  

Will other nations observe the French experiment as a potential avenue to combat their own press and information issues? Or will they avoid such observations--publicly at least--to avoid public backlash? 

Anyways, Macron is shaping up to be a pivotal figure in Europe not just because of the office he holds, but also thanks to his bold approach of using power.  How does this law shape the perception of Macron in France, Europe, and elsewhere?Facial hair was rather popular among Western officials during the Victorian Era as a sign of masculinity and strength. This phenomenon was true on both sides of the Atlantic, but it has since died out as a popular fashion statement, similar to powdered wigs. 

Facial hair, namely beards, is still revered in Western myths and literature as a sign of wisdom and strength as seen in the cases of Dumbledore, Gandalf, Obi-Wan Kenobi, etc. but in political settings—and professional settings in general—it is exceedingly rare. 

Several surveys have demonstrated that voters respond better to clean-shaven candidates, and that facial hair doesn’t afford the bearer any brownie points, so to speak. Some have speculated that facial hair can introduce distrust, but I am curious about a few things:

1.  What caused this rise in preference for clean shaven politicians?  
2.  Why has facial hair remained indicative of wisdom in our myths and stories despite the opposite being true in political settings?
3.  In lieu of those questions, is the status quo likely to change regarding facial hair or is likely to persist?[Here is the story, with video, from Tomahawk Nation](https://www.tomahawknation.com/florida-state-football-fsu-noles/2017/10/30/16573060/jacob-pugh-leadership-2017-team-compares-fsu-season-nightmare-cites-lack-of-player-leadership).

What does this say about the state of the program at this point in the season and in Jimbo’s tenure?  

Pugh further adds he thinks it is “too late” for leaders to emerge this year. I think he may be right after what happened Friday night.  Anyways, I’m curious to hear what y’all think.

Maca_Najeznica,1,1,"Svako malo se nađem u poziciji da nekome objašnjavam da tropski ciklon (AKA uragan) nije isti kurac kao naša bura, a da je jedina razlika što smo mi nadljudi, a drugi su pičkice. Pogledajmo malo razliku između bure i uragana.

\- Kod bure su problem samo udari vjetra (eventualno nešto padalina kod olujne bure), uragan ima tri destruktivna elementa (vjetar, podizanje razine mora, ekstremne padaline).

\- Vjetar: Kad čujete na vijestima da bura postiže 100+ km na sat to znači da je maksimalna snaga udara tolika. Bura puše u intervalima pa je između zatišje. Kad čujete da uragan ima vjetrove od 100+ km na sat to obično znači da kontinuirano puše vjetar te snage, a između mogu biti i jači intervali. Zamislimo zid napravljen da podnese maksimalne udare naše bure - uragan bi ga pritisnuo do točke pucanja pa ga držao tako satima s još jačim udarima. Tako da ne, mi nismo neki magovi graditeljstva, nego jednostavno nemamo takve vjetrove.

&#x200B;

\- More: ogromna sila vjetrova potisne more tako da se na rubovima razina često podigne više metara.

\- Padaline: Kod uragana nije neobično da u par sati padne godišnji ili višegodišnji prosjek padalina (što se i kod nas zna desiti povremeno), ali zajedno s podizanjem razine mora i razornim vjetrom.

\- Kao bonus kod uragana se zna desiti i da izazove mnoštvo tornada koji onda mjestimično naprave znatno veću štetu od samog ciklona.

&#x200B;

Zamislimo kako bi se recimo Zadar nosio s uraganom:

Prvo se diže se razina mora i potapa značajan dio grada (cijelu staru gradsku jezgru i sve niže kvartove). Dok počnu padaline i jaki vjetrovi solidan dio grada je već nedostupan hitnim službama. Vjetar u kojih 24 sata najjačeg divljanja oštećuje ili uništava kojih 20-50 posto struktura u gradu (primjerice prošle godine je Irma na Barbudi i St. Martinu razorila 95% građevina). Istodobno bujice poplavljuju manje više sve podrume u gradu, odnose aute, trgaju asfalt. Dok prođe najgore većina cesta je ili pod vodom, ili bez asfalta, ili pokrivena stablima, olupinama, krovovima. Velik dio grada je danima nedostupan, nema struje ni pitke vode tjednima. Šteta bi se mjerila u milijardama kuna, a oporavak bi trajao godinama."

Smartnership,2,8,"Starting when I was about five, my dad would take me flying. It wasn’t a big deal, just a matter-of-fact typical Sunday afternoon thing. “I thought we could go flying today, weather looks good for flying.”

I was not especially adventurous or risk-prone, yet I was never afraid at all.

It was safe, because it was my dad.

It was normal, surely all little kids go flying on weekends when the weather is nice.

It was wondrous, because my everyday world was at my feet and I saw it ever after with that bird’s eye view in mind.

It was wonderful, because the world was ours alone, just Dad and me flying slowly above it all in awed silence as the rivers, traffic, and breezes flowed lazily below.

It was my dad and his only child, a boy feeling like both the center of the world and infinitesimally small at the same time.

This was the purest father-son time I can recollect, long before life became so very complicated, before time began to slip away in the night, long before he became unable to recall much of our collective history."

Grevas13,2,5,"So, big sex abuse story.  5 hours in.  One of the faithful subs hasn't posted it, the other one removed it.

What does it take for believers to admit there is a problem and do something about it?  The first comment on the removed post was about how bad the people who enabled it are.  No acknowledgement that it's *official LDS policy* that caused this.  Those bishops were *told*, by representatives of the LDS Church, to let a girl continue to live with her rapist.

I've said this before and I'll say it again now, I remember when the Catholics had a child rape problem and we were so smug about it because we were better.  Where is that attitude now?  

At what point do you recognize that it's not individuals, or mixed messaging, or honest mistakes?  The LDS Church is *obviously* engaged in child sex abuse cover-up as a matter of course, and no one in the church says *shit* about it.  It's time to ask yourself, ""are we the baddies?""

Go to your leaders. Push for change.  Don't wait to be told to do the right thing.  Don't wait for change from the top that won't come.  If you've been taught good principles, exercise them.

Edit: [link to story](https://apnews.com/article/Mormon-church-sexual-abuse-investigation-e0e39cf9aa4fbe0d8c1442033b894660)

Edit 2: I read the slightly liberal faithful sub's post.  Can't leave my positive feedback there because I got banned long ago.  But I'm heartened by how many commenters there have the correct response that the church needs to change its policies on reporting abuse.  I'm glad to have found a little bit of common ground.  Still annoyed by the ones looking for a reason for this to not be the church's fault.They excommunicated him for it.  None of them reported.  Is that a systemic enough problem yet?  Or did they just all coincidentally make the same poor moral choice?

Two bishops, a helpline operator, and several other priesthood holders.  Leaders in the church.  

If you're going to stick with the line that all of these people had the same lapse in moral judgment, doesn't that start to imply an issue with Mormon morals?  When does it stop being a bad apple and become a systemic issue? Two? Five? Ten?  How many people have to keep it quiet before you'll admit something else is going on?Joseph Fielding McConkie and Craig Ostler published a research paper claiming the rock in a hat was a hoax.  Later, it was revealed that the LDS Church had it the whole time.

This doesn't show that the church lies.  It does, however, show that they're perfectly happy to let others lie for them, and won't attempt to correct the record.  It is also clear proof that the rock was, at at least one point in Mormonism, considered apocryphal.  Had the church always been truthful and up front about its history, the paper wouldn't have existed.

Edit: [Link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://emp.byui.edu/satterfieldb/Rel121/Process%2520of%2520Translating%2520the%2520BofM.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj8uqfi8Zr0AhX7HDQIHeAxAKMQFnoECAMQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Fel2VZ-ucz3RjhJ8zxrZl).The AP story dropped on August 4th.  It's been almost two months.  Zero announced changes to any policy.  Zero explanation of the damning evidence that shows the hotline prioritizes Church indemnity over child safety. The Church will presumably still use penitent privelege to avoid reporting child rape when they have the option.

I wonder how many cases have been covered up in just these two months?  Perhaps leadership has been too busy writing conference talks to remember Jesus' words about millstones.Assume Mormonism=true.  Assume all ordinances Joseph Smith was involved in were legitimate ordinances.  That means at least two ordinances that existed then were lost.  The modern church does not have the authority to seal a person as a servant, nor do they have the authority to seal a girl to a prophet in a sexual or non-sexual relationship that guarantees salvation for her family.  

Which means either Joseph was a fraud, or the church is in apostasy.  Mostly this is just to piss people off, check my logic before I use it.Sometimes you get everything.  Had a really good conversation with my mother yesterday.  She was always the parent I blamed most since she drove the religious involvement of our family.

It actually started because I was kind of having a panic attack, but of course after that was resolved we got on the topic of the church.  I explained that it took a really long time for me to get over being angry at her specifically but that I now understand she was a victim too.  I got unconditional apologies and other positive affirmation I needed. It was a good moment.

This morning, she texted me saying she found Quitmormon.com and was writing her and my dad's letters, and said if I wrote mine we'd drive to her bank and get it notarized and done.  She's the reason I never did it.  It was her final guilt trip.

Now I'm crying, dammit.To the tune of ""Do What Is Right."" My favorite hymn.

1. Do what you can; to cover for corporate

Never tell anyone what you have heard

Keep your mouth shut or you'll get your ass sued off

We could afford to, but won't do what's right

&#x200B;

Chorus

Keep your mouth shut while we beef up our stock price

Don't tell a soul or you'll ruin us all

She's just a girl, a nothing, a no one

Eyes on the prize boy, or you'll take the fall

&#x200B;

2. Keep your mouth shut; her pain's not important

Let her dad rape her for years of her life

We could make it stop, but the price isn't right[removed]Seriously.  Someone please explain to me *how* members come out of the AP article defending the church.  Even if you don't believe it's a coverup, being the most charitable I can be, the fact is an LDS Church representative gave a bishop incorrect information about state law and instructed that bishop to not report child abuse.  

A disciplinary council was held and the rapist was excommunicated.  No one can argue his crimes weren't known.  I don't know how many people are on a council.  Enough.

Those are facts.  The church knew he abused his daughter.  The church chose to not report it.  

That is the most charitable scenario.  An unknown representative of the Church telling a bishop for unknown reasons to leave a rape victim with her rapist.

And members are *fine* with this.  Sure, there are a few loud LDS voices (mostly on latterdaysaints) saying the same stuff I'm saying.  Even in the best case scenario, the LDS Church left a girl with a rapist.  So why are so many people saying the Church did nothing wrong, or that it was an accident, or they didn't know how bad the abuse is?  Those are all false.  They knew, they used that information to excommunicate the father. And it's weird that I feel like I have to make this explicit here, it's bad to leave a victim in a situation where you know she's being raped.

It shouldn't be hard to recognize that something went very wrong in the MJ case.  You should not be defending this, and honestly it's blood-chilling to watch.  Why does it seem that so many people can't even admit the facts of her case, much less take it seriously?  No one in the church cares? Maybe it makes you too uncomfortable?

 I need to know why you say you care when you won't talk about her.  It being legal isn't enough.  What makes it right?

If pointing out the failure in MJ's specific case and demanding it be fixed is too radical for modern Mormonism, what do you even have left? If you can't criticize your own church knowingly leaving a girl with a pedophile, what moral claim do you have?"

thepeaglehasglanded,9,1,"I'm reasonably new to all this progressive stack bullshit etc but I am really scratching my head as to why tech companies seem to be falling for it.

I would have thought that out of any industry people working in tech can be evaluated more transparently than any other occupation.

It's like the holy grail. If you think 'x' people are inferior, look at this code/product/program etc. Irrefutable evidence that your prejudice is wrong.

How did it get mainstream, how isn't this utter wrong--headedness not utterly obliterated on contact?Anyone found a good way of working with high res monitors?

The problem I have is my DAW scales properly but my VSTs don't, so my DAW can look shitty (because I tell it not to scale properly) or my VSTs are like postage stamps (4K monitor).

Have tried using magnifiers but haven't found anything that even approaches a reasonable compromise.

The only thing I can think of is buy a monitor, which is a bit of a shit solution.I recently purchased Ableton however I started learning with physical equipment in studios and using DAWs like Logic, Cubase and Studio One.

Where is the best place to find info along the lines of; you used to do it like this, here's how Ableton does it

Without having to trawl through hours of more basic stuff.

I've got past the major hurdles like - how do I create a drum beat and add an effect, which are actually very intuitive but not what I was expecting.

Basically I'm looking for a beginner's lesson without the 'here's what a compressor does'.
First of all, I DO NOT WORK FOR WAVESFACTORY.

Look at my history, this isn't marketing.

Download the demo here; https://www.wavesfactory.com/trackspacer/

Then get a synth lead, a bass and a kick going in your DAW. 

Make sure they overlap (i.e. bass and kick compete and synth is running over everything.

Put TrackSpacer on the synth and have the bass feed the sidechain, adjust the high pass so that only the bottom end is being processed and play around with the attack/release in 'advanced settings' until it sounds crisp. Start with release really long and throttle back.

Then put the synth and bass in a bus and add TrackSpacer to the bus with the kick as the sidechain and adjust high pass so that only the kick frequencies are being processed and adjust attack/release.

Then add light compression to the master bus (or whatever your usual chain is).

You can hear *everything* without having to make any compromises at all with EQing (in the regular fashion, I know that we are EQing now).

It's off the fucking hook.I have two Asus Vivo Notepad 8 slates. I installed Windows 10 on the first using a USB drive prepped with RMprepUSB after disabling Secureboot, changing the USB mode to EHCI.

I am using the exact same USB drive, with the same BIOS settings on the second device and after the first reboot of the installation process the device hangs at ‘Getting ready’.

I have seen other people say that Legacy Boot Mode is required, however the BIOS does not have this option.

I can’t for the life of me work out what is different with the second device, any ideas/suggestions?
To make realistic hi hat tracks the closed and open samples need to be in the same voice group and the 'Voices' set to 1.

This lets the following sample stop the previous sample from playing.

Hi hats aside, when would you use multiple voices? 

In other drum machines I have used the option is basically on or off, i.e. the sample will play regardless of anything else or it will be stopped by a different sample.

Battery offer 999 voices, I can't get my head around going from binary to 999. 

What does it mean?

It's so intense, it's starting to sound like a triple hi hat.

Seriously though, what is it for?I want to delete all MIDI and audio tracks so I can save a 'blank canvass' as my default Ableton set but I can't delete the very last MIDI track. The delete option disappears from the menu.

I know this may sound a but anal but it's bugging me....I have been using Studio One for a while and it's fucking awesome, however I've seen some interesting stuff in Ableton and had decided to give it a go.

I have a decent collection of VSTs effect already so I'm not really bothered about missing out of Amp, Cabinet and Corpus so the only real difference is are the additional instruments (Analog, Collision, Electric, Operator, Sampler and Tension) and the additional sound library.

I'd like to see what people think, is the suite worth the extra money given that I am moving from one DAW to another rather than starting from scratch?So far the sidechain EQs I have seen display the chain track spectrum over the source track so you can adjust EQ bands accordingly (or if you're fancy and have Fab Filter Pro Q2 etc you can automate this with EQ Match).

What I am looking for is a plugin that will leave the source track 'as is' until the chain track provides a signal and only then attenuate according to pre-defined settings.

For example you have a big synth and you want a snare (that isn't so important to the over all mix) to be a bit more present. The only way I can do this is to cut the synth to make room for the snare but I'm losing synth frequencies even when the snare isn't playing now.

I only need the EQ to be on when the snare hits.

Does anyone know of a plugin that does this and failing that, are they any other techniques I could be using?Just an observation really...

Having come from Cubase, Logic and Studio One to Ableton there are so many thing that are just blowing my mind. The workflow is so slick in so many ways and so far things like Warp seem rock solid etc.

However, there's stuff that is totally at odds with other DAWs it's really quite eye opening.

It's like you're in bed with an alien and know there is a hole somewhere and you are absolutely sure what to do with it but where the fuck is it?

 I'm looking in the manual/Google for how to split a clip. Surely that should be intuitive? Why not put it in the menu? I am all for short cuts but it seems a pretty totalitarian approach.

It's like it was designed for a different type of life form where this shit just didn't even occur to them.

Anyway, still best buy in a long time.

[removed]I went to my mechanic for new, front brakes and resurfacing of the front rotors.  My original brakes and rotors weren't in bad shape, at all, simply due for upkeep.

Within the next few days, I hear squeaking from the front brakes/rotors.  I go back, the mechanic says it was defective brake pads; they redo the brake job.  

Again, squeaking.  Take it in for the second time and they basically just look it over and ask me to try driving it more.  I do and it keeps happening. 

I take it in a third time and they install new, different brakes and resurface the rotors again.

Now, however slighter, they still squeak after a day or two of driving.

What do I do?  I know they're tired of seeing my car by now, but in my opinion, they have severely decreased the quality of my ride.  I wouldn't feel right paying them more money to fix something they caused.  They're good people, I think, so I would feel bad disputing the charge with my credit card company or asking them for a full refund.  It would be quite awkward to ask for a compromise credit of half or something, right?

I don't want to sour my relationship with them, because it seems they're trying -- but maybe they just aren't that good at their job?  Help!

** Edit, update **

I went to my mechanic for the fourth time and they (again) replaced the brakes.  This time with some ""guaranteed quiet"" brakes.  This apparently fixed the problem.  I haven't heard a peep out of them since then.  Not sure what the issue was, but I'm happy it's all finished!  Thanks again for all your help here, you guys are awesome.

There's this graph out there that shows the ""path to success."" I'm sure many of you have seen it, but for those who haven't type into google ""success chart"" and it's the one that has a graph with a straight line, and one with a squiggly line - gotta love the inability to post pictures or links on this sub : /

​

As of the past few months I have ""fallen of the wagon"" when it comes to personal development. I have been on the personal development path for about 2 and a half years. It's had it's up's and it's down, and this was definitely a down time.

​

And this frustrated me. It frustrated me that I had fallen off \*once again.\* And when I am frustrated I like to beat myself up. My subconscious/ego like's to say things like, ""see, I told you so, I told you this wasn't going to work, who do you think you are? blah blah blah."" And so when it came to personal dev I kinda did nothing for 5-7 months. No journaling, no nutrition, no meditation, no book reading, and lots of Reddit, YouTube, and Porn.

​

I felt out of control. I felt like all the gains I worked so fucking hard for had vanished before my eyes in a flash. I felt beaten. I felt powerless. I felt like my old self, a self in which I thought I'd never go back to. But there I was.

​

And this made me think of those alpine climbers that climb K2 and glaciers. It got me thinking of those times in movies where they loose their footing and start sliding down the mountain. Getting up these mountains takes a lot of time, sometimes days. And if they slip, they can loose hours of progress with each passing second.

​

Now, while these guys are free falling down the side of the mountain, do they just sit there and go ""man, this fucking sucks, I worked so hard to get where I was, only to make a mistake and loose all that progress, I guess everything is fucked and I'll just sit back and watch as I careen to the bottomless dark ice cavern that awaits me at the end of this.""

​

FUCK NO THEY DON'T.

​

What do they do? They grab their fucking ice pick, and drive it as hard as they can into the mountain in order to slow their uncontrolled decent. Then, when they eventually come to a stop, they get up, clean out their goggles, say ""goddamnit"", and then start walking back up the mountain.

​

They don't sit there and go ""woe is me, I suck, I can't do anything right, I may as well quit, good climbers don't fall, and I fell so that means I am bad at this.""

​

So if you find yourself sliding down the mountain when it comes to personal development remember to keep fighting. Don't let yourself beat yourself up. You can fucking do this. You HAVE to do this. Because if you just sit back you will eventually find yourself in a dark bottomless pit and no one wants to be there.

​

Stick that goddamn ice pick into the hill, stop the freefall, get up, and start walking.For those of you not familiar with the 80/20 rule I will explain, or you can watch a video of the concept here ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAynHZE-lK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAynHZE-lK4) ) Essentially is states that if you take an expert in something, say mini-golf for instance.  Out of their total knowledge on the subject, 20% of their knowledge will account for 80% of their skill.  This would be things like, ""follow through with your stroke, have both feet on an imaginary line pointing towards the hole, and hold your breath while hitting.)

&#x200B;

Conversely the remaining 80% of their knowledge is responsible for the remaining 20% of their skill.  If you know about the law of diminishing returns you'll have no problem understanding this concept.

&#x200B;

So my question is, when it comes to things you should do to develop a healthy microbiome, what are the 20% of actions that will yield you 80% of the results?Hey guys...here is my issue and I was hoping someone here would lend me advice.  I would greatly appreciate it. 

&#x200B;

I am a visualist that creates site renderings for environmental reports, corporate renovations, hospitals, ect.  Right now I am working on a 75 lot subdivision that is located on a large hill and each home site has different elevations.  Lots of slopes, and a central spline road that carves through the site.  

&#x200B;

As you can imagine, lots of complex grading.  

&#x200B;

Here's the thing.  The engineer on the site has already completed the site grading.  I was wondering if there was a way that I could import the topographic contour lines from AutoCAD into Sketchup Pro?  I have the ability to import .DWG files, but for some reason the grading file the engineer supplied me is not importing. 

&#x200B;

This would save me a TON of time, and would make my visualization so much more accurate, which my clients would love.

&#x200B;

Is there a specific thing he needs to do on his end in AutoCAD to make for a clean .DWG that will cleanly import ONLY the contour topographic lines into Sketchup?

If it was a static image then the fix would be simple, ""cut out"" the tree, and move it to it's own layer above whatever you insert.  But I am working with animated footage, and need an automated process.  My issue is this.  In a lot of the footage that I work with, there are things in the foreground of where I insert my 3D model.

Most of these kids are starting from zero knowledge, so I’ll be working with fresh minds, and here’s what my short term outlook for lesson plans look like - I would love critique and feedback. 

1. Teach how to learn a language (Anki, other resources, mindsets, etc.) 
2. Teach 한글 and pronunciation 
3. Survival phrases 
4. Teaching of the present tense ONLY. 
5. Studying of a frequency list (fluency forever‘s to be exact)   

From that point I’m not sure where I’d go, and in between those I’ll weave in culture, food, content, etc. 

Thanks so much guys :)**TLDR: Like Kabal said in Mortal Kombat the movie:**

>**Take your price, then double it and double it again**

**I'm having to learn new words to attempt to describe how much value and insight is in this package. You can tell the amount of work they put into this simply by the level of detail they go into (36% of my serve returns are lifts, for example), and they split everything into an easy to digest format with actionable advice.**

**They then send a video as well, to try and show concepts that may not be easy to explain in writing - and it added a personal touch haha which was sweet. You can tell everything is custom-made for each individual player and I'm definitely adding this to my monthly budget.**

# Intro

For those that don't know /u/badminton-insight, is a mixed double professional pair that runs a badminton Youtube channel teaching various aspects of the game. Unlike other channels, they also offer training resources on their website like multishuttle programs, weight/core routines, and virtual coaching (all really useful for a player like me who doesn't have access to a physical coach).

This review will talk about the process and contents of the coaching, in as much depth as I can give. Note this was NOT sponsored in anyway and I paid out of pocket so this is an unbiased review.

# Ordering Process

Purchasing was fairly simple, you buy the coaching via their website/payment portal, and then you get sent an email of how to submit footage to them for their review. Everything is super easy to follow.

Anything can be submitted, from a video of an isolated technique you're practicing to footage of a match. Just as long as it's no longer than 15 minutes. I recommend (and they do too) editing out the breaks between rallies to get as much footage time in as possible.

From there, it's just uploading and sending to them - they quote a 2 week turnaround time which I found to be accurate in my time.

Note that this order was placed last month when Greg had a concussion and I was still able to receive it in this timeframe - so I assume under normal circumstances it would be even quicker!

Jenny took the time to send me personal emails keeping me updated on the situation and status - you can tell a lot of love and work goes into these!

# Written Review

When I got the files back, I knew I was in for a treat. The PDF was 20MB, so even before I downloaded it, I knew it was going to be chockful of information. And boy was I right!

I submitted a mixed doubles video so this was most definitely their expertise - I can't comment on how they have done with singles or MD (yet, I plan to submit these kind of videos later) but they did an excellent job of providing encouraging by highlighting what strengths I did have, and tips to improve them - I've had coaches/players just be totally negative and it can be demoralizing.

Their thinking is easy to understand and they explain it just in case anyways, and always include tips on how to practice it so you can actually implement it later into a game.

I could also tell that they were putting a lot of intention and thinking into this, as they asked questions and made inferences to why I did certain things - like I stood at the line while serving in this XD match (the reasoning btw, was because I wanted to put more pressure on my flick, as my opponent was physically weaker than me) and they knew I had a background in MD.

Lastly the last thing I want to state is they covered mental aspects - which was not expected. Their youtube channel just released a video talking about mentality, so maybe it was fresh on their minds haha. But I did state that I was feeling nervous for this finals match when I submitted the video and they provided some feedback on what I could do to help calm the nerves - I had edited out the breaks and intervals so it was really good to see their experience as pro players shine here.

# Video Review

The video review was about 7 minutes long and covered 4 aspects that they wanted to show me. It was more impressive that Greg was showing me, as he is a leftie but was able to show me all of the proper right-handed footwork, grips, serve returns (while having a concussion!).

Again, you don't feel like just another order number - as they really take the time to customize the information to your current situation through saying stuff like ""We noticed this in your match"", etc.

They also included footage of training routines I could do to practice certain weaknesses - like better shot placement and quality in the midcourt.

# Summary

**I think this is a great tool that any non-professional player should consider. If you don't have a dedicated coach, this will definitely help fill that void.**

Costs can be prohibitive of course, but if you can afford this it's 200% worth it. I'm mostly an independent player and am always asking different people about different things but this is easily one of the highest quality sources of information I come across.

It's also a massive time saver - you could probably analyze matches yourself but you're likely to miss something or perhaps may not be able to diagnose the problem and only the symptoms.

Their products are extremely fairly priced, and I use the multishuttle drills for training, core routines when I'm home, and the workout routines on my ""leg"" days in the gym. Now only if they could sell me a proper feeder and I'd be set haha.

Thanks again Greg/Jenny! - Nigel"

**Highlights of the New Branch**

* French cruisers kinda-sorta get torpedo protection, up to an ""unprecedented"" 16% for higher tiers. Now you can watch yourself flood to death for even longer. Accordion renditions of ""Nearer My God to Thee"" are encouraged, but not required.

* We couldn't think of a way to make the new line interesting, so we decided to steal yet another mechanic from destroyers and give it to cruisers. This will make up for the average guns, terrible AA and laughable armor. Probably. All jokes about running away faster will be met by an immediate ban.

* Following the finest traditions of War Gaming naming conventions, we have decided to give the new tier 10 cruiser the most unfortunate shortened nickname possible. Players who own the SPIC in World of Tanks are no longer alone in the giggles they receive in every game.

**Interface**

* Increased the size of player names, so you spend less time looking for that asshole who rushed into the center, died 30 seconds into the match, and spent the next 19 minutes bitching about how terrible his team is.

* Cyclones no longer run on Dragon Ball Z time. When we say they'll begin in five minutes, they'll actually begin in five minutes. Frieza is disappointed.

* We've caught up with 2012 technology and added borderless window as an option. We would have added it sooner, but Anatoli kept insisting on adding artsy edges to the screen. While pretty, dried flowers and unicorns don't fit the theme. Sorry, Anatoli.

**Clans**

Added system notifications for:

* Creating a clan for the four guys you met on Steam like six years ago but you can't remember the names of, but you feel bad asking after all this time so you just refer to them as ""dude"" or ""man"".

* Randomly inviting people in the hopes that there's someone to play with when you get off work at 3 in the morning.

* Desperately trying to get into SIMP and being rejected. Again.

* Shutting down the clan after what's-his-name says his wife and two kids keep him too busy to keep playing. Introspection and the realization that you're in your thirties and lacking both of those things is free.

* Blocking ItzSteve99 from relentlessly applying to your clan, because Steve is the fucking *worst*. We played a couple pity games with you back in November because your cousin asked us to. We don't actually want to hang out, Steve. Seriously, just go play something else. God.

* Drunkenly accepting Steve to the clan and making him 2nd in command, then immediately regretting your decision in the morning.

* Removing Steve as 2nd in command.

**Ship Balance and Appearance Changes**

* Detection range lowered for a couple of ships. Does anyone like the New Orleans yet? Please play it. We spent a lot of time making it look nice. You've driven Alexei to drink (more than usual).

* Japanese ships now have turret rotation times that aren't comparable to the movement of glaciers.

**Other Changes**

* German cruisers now T H I C C er. Oh ja.

* Des Moines is now a battleship.

* Higher tier Japanese torpedoes got a 100m buff to detectability, or the lack thereof. Reports of players giving a collective ""meh"" and popping hydro are unfounded and the buff is fine. IT'S FINE.

* Rolling the dice on Shimakaze torpedoes is entirely up to player skill. Stop laughing.

* Secondary range on Tirpitz has increased to a base of 7km. Now when you're training your secondary-specced captains you won't feel like a complete tool. No, it still won't stop people from calling you ""Derpitz"". Sorry.

* Shells fired from the König are no longer whacked with a hammer and covered in grease before being fired.

* Khabarovsk rudder shift time greatly increased. Look, someone from the Balance department really missed the old T-50-2, and the Khabarovsk was his chance at having a tiny bit of joy in his life. You ruined that, you monsters. We hope you're happy.

**Ship Appearance Changes**

* We're still figuring out this whole ""cables aren't made of jagged edges"" thing.

**Maps and Weather**

* Some maps now look better, not that you'll ever notice.

* ""Haven"" is now not a haven. Sorry.

**New Port**

* Beauty shots of your port queens no longer limited to brief views of red panty lines. Pixelated keels are pending on the Asian client.

**Technical Updates (and) Fixes**

* The game will crash less when watching a replay. Official replay support coming SOON™. We swear.

* Fixed your last surviving torpedo squadron pilot shitting himself when you order him to attack a ship. If he didn't want to be the last pilot then he shouldn't have kept bothering us about shore leave. I mean, really.

* We StarCraft now, bois.

* Fixed an oddly specific instance of alt-tabbing while holding down an arrow key. Who uses arrow keys these days, anyway?

* Players are no longer able to rage-select the lowest rating for a game they've already left.

* Made it even less appealing to own a Dunkerque.

* Colorado no longer tricks players into thinking it has a built-in geosynchronous satellite/fire control system.

* Removed shoe polish from Tachibana's binoculars.

* Added Go-Pros to low-tier German BB turrets. Terrible butt-rock soundtrack and Windows Movie Maker transitions not included.

**Russian players have finally upgraded from XP and Vista. From this patch forward, we will optimize the game for computers that aren't on par with five year old iPads.**

**New Content**

* HMS Hood given to a select number of players so they can lord them over everyone else. Smug British laughter and monocles will be provided at no cost.

* Royal Navy battleships coming SOON™. In the mean time, why not grind your teeth at the introduction of yet another premium British ship? There is a joke to be made here about British people and bad teeth, but we can't be arsed to find it.

* Added a Regia Marina flag so you can pretend you're in a ship line you actually care about.

* You can't get High School Fleet stuff for free, but you *can* have a fucking cat as a commander. On one hand, he's still less of a human dumpster fire and far more likable than Steven Seagal. On the other hand, he can't do tai chi on the deck of your ship. Yet.

* Speaking of dumpster fires, we've added more achievements to Clash of the Elements, in case you lack a social life, a job, or school. Ain't nobody got time fo dat (except Steve. *Fucking Steve*).

* Undocumented change: drunk secondary gunners will no longer try to punt their little shells into the thickest part of a ship's armor. Shouts of ""I'll get them *this time*!"" were not, in fact, enough to defeat citadels.


P.S: Reddit formatting still sucks.[removed][**We interrupt your regularly scheduled shipposting to bring you sort-of regularly scheduled shipposting.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYqCi6o5r5I)

Hello again, my pretties. How's everyone doing this fine day? Good? Goood. So, with the release of 0.6.5, I thought it about time to make myself known once more and let you all know what the real story is with the patch notes. Originally this was going to be a [one-off thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfWarships/comments/6699kt/update_064_patch_notes_what_they_actually_mean/), but since *most* people seemed to like the last one I thought I'd give it another go.

[TO THE PATCH NOTES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4c77EVWm-A)

------------------------------------------------------

#ZE DISGUSTING PROPAGANDA HUNT FOR DAS GREATEST BATTLESCHIFF EVER CREATED

* Update 0.6.5 marks the first ~~historical~~ campaign of filthy lies to be introduced to World of Warships. Spend a month grinding out missions created by and for people with absolutely zero obligations in real life in the vague hopes of acquiring pins that you'll never look at after receiving. As usual, these missions can be completed multiple times on the off chance that you don't want to attempt to, say, capture 3 zones in a battleship without being spotted while under the light of a blood moon on the second Tuesday of every week.

* Pray to RNGesus and hope He is merciful with yet another set of containers to open. Rewards include more camouflage designed by an artist who may or may not have been on drugs at the time, one-time use flags, and historical pins that feature sheep for some reason. Bloody Welsh.

* Duplicate pins can be traded in for new pins (4 old for 1 new). Fears of adopting Overwatch's policy of ""We know you already have this thing, so here's a paltry amount for getting it again, thanks for playing, go fuck yourself"" are averted for now.

* Complete all of the missions to get **THE PRIDE OF THE KRIEGSMARINE, THE MIGHTY BISMARCK**, if for some reason you don't already own it. And really, why don't you? German BBs are *completely balanced* and everyone should have gone down the line, unless you're some kind of dirty, cowardly DD player.

* Oh, you got in my secondary range? What a *shame*. I hope I didn't scare ye with mah face ta face [MAN FOIGHTIN'](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/711903286868009029/CEA04B8BA9334CD3FA89F4F4640B417CF25368B9/).

* If you already own ze Bismarck, you'll receive 11,000,000 credits instead. This is more than you're probably going to receive from 20 Super Containers, so enjoy getting something of value before yet another worthless module drops.

* Collect every available pin to get a frickin' sweet set of Bismarck camos: one that (probably) matches her/his/xer/its historical look before it was sunk by the Tommies, and one that *raises it from the fucking dead*. Holy shit.

* Seriously though, ""Zombismarck"" would be a great title for a B-Movie. You could get the guy who directed Dead Snow to make it. I don't think he's doing anything these days anyway. My pick for lead actor? Peter Stormare. Yeah it would probably use up the vast majority of the movie's budget, but tell me that shit wouldn't be the best thing ever put to film. Nazi zombie battleship. You could simultaneously revive two flailing genres at once. Or kill them off *forever*, I suppose. Worth the risk.

#User Interface

* Reduced the number of clicks needed to do things on the campaign maps, because moving your mouse is *hard*.

* You can press escape to exit the campaign map at any point, because moving your mouse is *hard*.

* Made the campaign menus easier to navigate in general, as well as made the rewards more obvious. Now you don't have to go through your rewards and wonder where the hell those flags and credits came from after a battle.

* Camo can now be removed from ships without destroying it. In retrospect, arguing that it's not historically accurate to remove virtual paint from a non-existent ship was not a winning position.

* Those of you with a frothing, irrational, undying hatred of chinese cartoons can still disable the floating night club skins for Arpeggio ships. Be sure to tell everyone how much you despise anime and the people who watch it, and downvote every topic and post that even remotely mentions it, just so everyone knows how much you hate people liking things that you don't.

#New Skins

* I don't actually have a joke here ^^^or ^^^anywhere ^^^else ^^^in ^^^this ^^^post but the camos are fucking awesome and everyone should want them. If you don't, you're wrong. And probably a Hanzo main.

* Shit. Look, I've been playing comp matches for the last month and I couldn't help myself.

* I mean, scatter arrow is such a bullshit ability. You just vaguely aim in the general direction of someone and delete them.

* No, I don't see a connection to a certain ship type in World of Warships. You shut your damn mouth.

* If for some reason you don't like looking at the best camo in the game, you can disable it via an in-game option. *Untermensch*.

#WHERE DA HOOD, WHERE DA HOOD, WHERE DA HOOD AT

* After much harumph-ing and fixing of monacles, the Hood and Warspite have been buffed to the point of being ~~blatantly overpowered~~ usable.

* [RULE BRITANNIA](https://i.redd.it/h14cy8vv6vxy.jpg)

* BRITANNIA RULE THE WAVES

* Nigel now complains significantly less about hand-cranking enormous battleship turrets. Manners maketh man.

* If you happen to own the Hood and its historically awful and stupid AA rockets that *somehow* do shitloads of damage in-game, you can obtain a set of camos for it as well. The mostly unexploded zombie version is available, but I can't think of a good zombie pun for the Hood so it's obviously inferior in every regard.

* As an added bonus for owning the Hood, you get to spend every single game watching players make jokes about being detonated by the Bismarck. If you do get detonated by the Bismarck, post that shit to Reddit ASAP and rake in that sweet, sweet karma before someone else does.

#Ship Appearance

* In our continuing efforts to make the game optimized for technology beyond fifth-hand 2004 Dell PCs, we have taken a sander to the cables, ropes and other bits of improvised bondage on tier 9 ships.

* Improved the textures of underwater hulls, not that you'll ever notice. Just take our word for it, we promise it's a thing.

* French and German engineers have finally discovered that radar works better when it's not stuck facing forward all the time.

* Bougainville's smoke stack has been thoroughly hammered into its proper position thanks to the continuing efforts of Jean-Phillipe and his OCD. We originally had it right, but Anatoli thought it would be funny to change it ever so slightly.

* Speaking of OCD, the Yamato now has symmetrical aircraft catapults. World of Warships: now playable.

* Convinced Sergei to move the fucking camera out from behind the ropes of the Ognevoi. Attempts to get him to stop uploading in 4:3 resolution with white Windows Movie Maker text intros are ongnevoing.

* I'm so sorry.

* On behalf of Viktor Kizl...Kesli...THE BOSS, and War Gaming as a whole, I would like to apologize for that pun. It was truly awful, and inexcusable despite my writing this at 1AM and living off of stale coffee. You deserve better. You're not actually going to *get* better, but you deserve it nonetheless.

* Helmut has been hanging out with Sergei too much, and apparently set his go-pro behind one of the guns. The camera has now been mounted on a selfie stick to provide a clearer view.

* It only took *two years*, but we finally fixed the barrel jacket colors on high-tier US BBs. Better late than never.

#New Content

* Two new ships have been given to supertesters and/or youtubers to lord over everyone else: The Neil De Grasse and the Kidd. It is unknown if the Kidd comes with a [pirate flag](http://www.usskidd.com/images/661-flag_39g5dxu7.jpg), which will probably be the determining factor for a lot of people buying it. That's not a joke. I need that flag.

* New achievements have been added to the game, thus providing yet more medals you'll never look at again.

#Shit, We Really Should Have Noticed That Before (aka bug fixes)

* Fixed a bug where Anatoli kept naming songs in Cyrillic. 

* A window saying ""Yeah, but are you, like, *really* sure you want to mount that camo?"" has been removed.

* Fixed a bug where your cursor would display the incorrect status when in a carrier. What status, you ask? *All* of them.

* Removed the cursor from carrier play.

* Removed carriers from gameplay. Nobody noticed.

* A pop-up of the Bad Idea Captain saying ""I see you're playing a carrier; who hurt you as a child?"" has been removed.

* Increased the pay of all ship crews so that they'll no longer protest against going into battle immediately after returning to port.

* Fixed a bug with players rage-clicking through containers in the hopes of seeing their first Super Container in three months.

* Fixed the crew of turret 3 from screaming incoherently and drawing the camera to themselves upon spotting an enemy ship.

* Stopped all spotter crews from saying ""but I am *le tiiired*"" before begrudgingly bringing up their binoculars.

* Possibly stopped ships in dry dock from unwillingly becoming the next ""participants"" in the Philadelpha Experiment. Maybe. Not that it ever happened in the first place. You look like a smart guy, and smart guys don't ask too many questions, ya understand?

Edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger.




Hello there, everyone. I was recently pointed to this sub, and I knew it would be right up my alley. Quick bit of history: I've worked in the hospitality industry since 2007, in one of the busiest tourism cities in the world. In that time I've seen and heard just about everything, but one story in particular still stands out.

Several years ago, when I was at a different hotel, we had a middle-aged woman and her early 20s-ish son check into one of our suites. They seemed nice enough, if kinda weird. I was chatting with them while I made their key cards, and the woman says she's the owner of a strip club. I ask her which one, and she names a place I'd never even heard of. A google search later revealed it to be some little hole in the wall place with a gimmick where everyone dressed like librarians or something. Odd, but not the oddest thing I've ever heard.

The night goes by pretty quietly. The son departed the room almost immediately to go party on the town, which just left the mother in the room. I didn't see her leave at any point, and there weren't any noise complaints about her, so I thought nothing of it and went about my business.

I come in around noon the next day for one of our monthly meetings, and I immediately notice that all of the housekeepers and most of the front desk staff are gathered in a group. I head over to see what the fuss is about, and notice that the head housekeeper has her phone out and is showing off pictures of a room that someone had trashed. The room that I had checked the strip club lady into.

Apparently, this woman was straight-up batshit crazy and a drug addict. The damage to her room included:

-Both queen bed duvet covers with multiple cigarette holes burned in them.

-Half-smoked joints tucked under pillows (with accompanying burn marks) and thrown around the room.

-A small mirror with what was *very* clearly cocaine left out on the nightstand.

-A broken shower rod and torn shower curtain.

-A shattered bathroom mirror, upon which she had written, in black permanent marker, ""WATCHING ME"".

And, most confusingly of all, dozens of strips of duct tape hung from the ceiling.

My manager had gotten ahold of the woman's son shortly after the she left (since she wasn't answering the number she gave us), but he was being evasive and said he didn't know anything about it. He did, at least, give us a proper number to reach her at. When the manager called *that* number, the woman answered and very calmly explained that she would gladly pay for any charges. The one thing that stood out more than anything, the manager said, was that when she asked what was with the duct tape, the woman responded, as if it was the most clear, obvious thing in the world, ""It's to catch the ghosts, of course.""

She ended up being charged several thousand dollars, and to this day I'm not sure if they ever actually informed the police.

This industry, man. I'll never know what some people are thinking.Look: I get that the price you're being quoted for a room might be too high depending on your budget, or how much use you'll get out of the room because you're checking in late, or myriad other factors, but *please* stop coming up with bullshit excuses for why you don't want it.

I've been doing this for a long time, and I can always tell when someone is just jerking me along. ""I need to discuss it with my [insert person here]"" despite you being the only one in the car, ""I'm gonna grab some dinner and I'll be back"", ""Let me just go park my car"", ""I need to go transfer some money to my account"". You don't have to lie to my face, just fucking tell me you don't want a room.

Is it really so difficult to say ""thanks anyway""? I'm not gonna be angry or upset that you don't want a room. I really don't give a shit either way. If you want a room at the price quoted, then great. If not, then that's fine too."
DeathDevilize,4,5,"With the release of Duskblade, Yi can finally go the full blade route, order is: Stalkers Blade Devourer, Blade of the Ruined King, Rageblade, Ghostblade, Duskblade, Gunblade. 

No boots since we already have swordboots. Since the Kogmaw re-rework this item is basically useless on everyone except maybe Kayle, its unusable for melees because they dont have the time to stack it up and honestly its stats are just stupid since you lose AS from completing it.

Also Situation ist wie folgt: 

Ich bin 23, Arbeitsunfähig durch PTBS (Mutter hat 3x versucht mich umzubringen und da gibts noch einiges mehr) und ca seit dem 2-3 Jahr in Psychologischer Behandlung (bisher ohne Verbesserung), meine Ärztin hatte mir bisher 2 Anti-depressiva verschrieben von denen eins keine Wirkung und das andere es schlimmer gemacht hatte also hat sie sich dazu bereiterklärt mir gegen Ende des Monats Cannabis zu verschreiben damit zumindest meine Schlaf und Essstörungen in den Griff zu kriegen sind (alle Schlafmedikation bishin zu Benzo Diazepam zeigen entweder keine Wirkung oder verursachen Schlafparalyse). 

Ich hab mir also ein paar Artikel darüber durchgelesen und bemerkt das die Krankenkasse so ca die Hälfte aller Anträge darauf ablehnt und Ich kann mir das definitiv nicht selbst leisten also wie stehen in etwa meine Chancen? 

Außerdem wenn Ich dann mit dem Rezept in die Apotheke gehe, werde Ich dann trozdem das erste bezahlen müssen und darauf warten/hoffen das die Krankenkasse mir das zurückerstattet? Denn bereits das würde meinen finanziellen Rahmen bei weitem überschreiten. https://vrporn.com/waifu-sex-simulator-vr-2-3/

I checked the new hard drive and it is filling up with data at about 3MB/s. Earlier though, I transferred files between the two hard drives at 15-20MB/s speeds.  I realize it's a lot of small files/links so it will be a little slower. 

I can see some of the files on the new hard drive so I think it's transferring but the status bar being stuck at Zero KB is giving me second thoughts.  I don't want to wait 15 hours to find out that it didn't properly transfer.

Ranjeliq,6,7,"First, people complained about lvl10 gym stagnation, how is it boring, not interesting, you can basically do nothing and harvest your coins for ages. How it's easy for spoofers to hold the gyms with their over9000 CP Snorlaxes and Dragonites, and you can do nothing to against it. How ""winter is coming"". How instinct players not getting their ""piece of cake"" and yellow gyms are basically non-existent.

Now, people complaining about how they want to hold their lvl10 gyms for ages, but ""*lazy lvl 1-25*"" players *keep battle* your gyms you want to hold (could someone explain me, please, how can you mix together *lazy*, *lvl25* and *keep battle* in one sentence and be ok with it?), how is it easy to a spoofers to get their coins (they are spoofers, ffs, their live **is** easy until next banwave).

Yes, I understand, that there always be different opinions. I understand that spoofers are ruining the game for other players. I understand, that from our perspective, Niantic playing ""1 step  forward, two steps back"" game. What I don't understand is the one group of legit players hating the other group of legit players and saying that the one particular feature should be in their hands.

Let's all agree, that we all want to get our piece of cake in this game. No matter, who we are: casual or hardcore,  Mystic/Instinct/Valor, lvl5 or lvl35. We all want to be able to play the whole game, we all want to participate. 
Remember it and chill, because we're all slowly turning this subreddit into r/NoMansSkyTheGame. When I started my small WH exploration, hacking, which wasn't a problem before, hits me hard with yellow and red containers. After a few guides, I realise, that there is a minesweeper thing in hacking minigame, so you can dodge some defensive systems, and open the board first. I tried and failed, and I think, I don't understood the minesweeper thing well, I had many times when point says ""4"" or ""3"" (so, the system should be in 4 or 3 points away, as I understood from the guides, probably, misunderstood), but the point right next to it has a system. 

Can someone explain the thing to the newbie? What I misunderstood?
I purchased Freedom bundle which contains The Witness, and now I'm going to purchase a monthly bundle, which contains it, too. I want to redeem one copy myself, and another gift to a friend. Won't Humble Bundle cancel my second copy, because I already own one? Should I redeem my copy / gift copy to a friend before I purchase Monthly Bundle? Or it will handle it properly, and I'll end up with 2 copies?Hi, all!

I've owned GD for pretty long, but decided to finally jump into it just this winter. I've made 2 characters: blademaster (using mainly Cadence, Ring of Steel, Shadow Strike and Pneumatic Burst) and druid (using Trozan's Sky Shard, Wind Devil and Storm Totem with some other arcanist spells, like Olexra's Flash Freeze and Nullififcation for utility). 

Blademaster build sound pretty great and potentially strong in endgame, but I was bored by it's gameplay by lvl 30 or so and decided to go for the druid, which, I think, turned out to be another extreme case, because it's a piano build with various cooldowns you need to look after. While it's gameplay is extremely engaging, it's also exhausting.

Could someone recommend me a build which will be a middle-ground between those two? I'll probably try to build a summoner in near future (occultist - shaman combo) and some fire ""caster""-like build with demolitionist, but are there any other combinations that I should check out? I prefer caster builds, but if there any weapon-focused build that could fit the criteria, I'd like to check them, too.First of all, it's second or third time I'm trying to make the build myself, so I might be clueless with some obvious things, sorry.

The idea is pretty simple - Trickster Blade Vortex Build oriented to physical damage with an addition of chaos through Poison Support gem, Force Shaper passive and Patient Reaper ascendancy passive. Build is not crit-oriented.

* Main skill links:
Blade Vortex - Poison - Faster Casting - Controlled Destruction - Increased AoE - Concentrated Effect

* Movement skill links:
Whirling Blades - Faster Attack - Fortify

* Auras:
Hatred, Arctic Armour

* Golems:
Fire or Chaos (depends of lack of offence or defence)

[Skill tree](http://poeplanner.com/AAIAATxBQUlHQWc4QWM3RFlvdG5JRlBWdmFvd1d2M1g5MUVLMVNPdGpFUzhyQ2wzeURrZ1JsZ2NlbFM3dzFZXzZYRUJVdlJYdGxvdlZ1U2FWWWVMbWdjdTlENnNraThNNlN3cXBOR0VHdDlraTZ1aldteVl5QWJJWnozcF94cE1uTDUwVzh5WThiQXNpOUcwWkxZc2Z4eXQ0TEp3UkxYeUQ2LTZhNEVXZFUxSUYtUlh3a3ZOZVJlLUktVGZYejBteC1XT2ppaVAyVFpJeTBVVkh3R2ExQk9RaTFhYURDVy1leWtwUlRLeEhtN1Zmc0R3RjczeGg2M3BUZlZzcVRVZmlJdUtrT1Jwc051a2txaFp2NDJwSlVRU3pvZ0NFeFQ4blg1aFpiYzh5aEdfNXBIRFVUSU4wZ1R5MjJqc0pJS09qABRBQUFDQUFmUUFRSDBBUUlMQWdBPQAA)

And that's where I'm stuck. I don't want to go to Chaos Inoculation passive nor to a low-life, so I sticked with life, but I don't know, if I needed much passives in ES? Evasion? Trickster's Shade form offers such great +es +evasion, but is it enough? I feel like I can't balance my build between offence and defence, it always lacking on one side or another. Also, I'm very clueless with auras, Hatred seems like obvious one, and AA might work as an additional defensive system. I'm planning do something defensive with CoDT, too.

Don't have any ideas on the gear either. Planning to get some spell dagger, ES shield, Eva chest, but I don't have any specific ideas.

Will this build work? What some obvious mistakes I've made? Any suggestions?This one is pretty new to the game and looking to join a friendly guild. To contact ingame: @Lavi-chanSo, that's a second kitty in my life, but first one was so problemless and easy to handle when she was young, so I don't know very well how to handle this one and want some advise. 

She's around 2 month old (according to her mom's owner, anyway) and we brought her home yesterday. She cried every minute of her existense there (which is understandable: new home, new people, no mom) exept when she was sleeping on my lap. I'm okay with this and this ""issue"" will probably fix itself in a week or two, when she adapts to the new environment.

What bothers me more is that she won't sleep alone in her own bed: when I place her there, she jumps right out, follows me to my bed, climbs on it, climbs on top of me (or my bf, but prefers me) and then calms down and falls asleep. While I'm not totally against her sleeping with us, she is so small and fragile, I'm terrified of the thought what could happen with her if one of us will fall into deep sleep and starts turning while sleeping.

Should I just give her time or I can do something to help her sleep in her own place?

Edit: Ty all for the advice! I'll definitely try to add some piece of my clothing to her place to make her feel more comfortable.
I don't like the idea to close her in another room at night, I think she's stressed enough already, but I try it, too, if nothing else will work. Seems like stress is the ""lesser of two evils"" here."

Jeg må innrømme at jeg ikke stemte på Rødt eller SV ved siste valg, jeg hadde lyst, for mye av det  disse partiene kjemper for er også ting som jeg mener er viktig. Å utjevne de sosiale forskjellene, ikke la private aktører tjene penger på et strømnett kjøpt og betalt med skattebetalernes penger, det er bare noen få områder hvor jeg er enig med politikken disse partiene fører. 
Men det har alltid vært NATO og EU motstanden til disse partiene som har stoppet meg fra å stemme på dem. Jeg er enig i noe av kritikken når det gjelder NATO, ikke på strukturell nivå, men jeg kan forstå skepsisen til rollen traktaten har hatt etter fallet av Berlin muren.Når det gjelder motstand til EU, la meg bare si at jeg er uenig i hele politikken. Det er mange grunner til det, men kanskje den viktigste av dem alle er denne;
Jeg er født i et land som lå bak jernteppet når jeg kom til verden. De første 8 årene av mitt liv tilbrakte jeg under et kommunistisk system og Sovjetstatens tunge støvel. Jeg så hvordan dette landet etterhvert fikk sin egen frihet og demokratiet dem alltid lengtet etter. Jeg opplevde hvor mye det betydde for innbyggerne i dette landet når dem endelig kunne hvile bak NATO’s skjold og senere ble del av et Europeisk medlemskap som dem følte seg revet vekk fra i over et halvt århundre. 

Jeg har nå bodd i Norge det meste av mitt liv, jeg føler meg norsk, jeg er norsk statsborger og jeg er stolt av verdiene dette landet representerer. Jeg har alltid prøvd å leve opp til dem og samtidig representere disse verdiene under mine mange reiser i Europa og resten av verden. 

Husk at Europa faller sammen og reiser seg sammen. Vi er ikke isolert fra skjebnen til dette kontinentet. Uavhengigheten vår i 1814 skjedde i en stor grad på grunn av en krig Napoleon og hans allierte Danmark tapte. Denne krigen ble avgjort på slagmarker tusenvis av kilometer unna Norge. 

Nå er vi så heldig at vi kan bestemme vår egen skjebne i dette landet, vi kan velge å stirre Putin i øynene og si nok er nok! Europa står samlet og vi burde være en del av det!"

JoeLithium,6,3,"Go AwayI have been seeing him for a little while in attempt to clear through the rubble that are my thoughts, especially while moving through my divorce. While discussing the divorce, I mentioned that I tried very hard to make the marriage work. That's what I believe you should do in a marriage. You have made a commitment, and you now need to stick to that commitment. Life is about making choices and dealing with the consequences. Just because it gets hard does not mean you give up. Unfortunately marriage being a two way street, my wife, was the one who left. After telling him this he asked ""What is your religion.""

I told him that I do not have one. I am an Atheist. 

He then went on to say that I have many Christian values. 

Here's where I disagree. While many of my values and morals may agree with Christian values, or even come from Christianity, I consider them human values. Working through issues with someone whom you love is about commitment. About being a man, and about working through the shit. If you just give up then nothing has meaning. Is that really a Christian value?

While this discussion did not particularly bother me, as it was a tame debate, the next part did.

I feel he overstepped his boundaries in telling me that I should go to church. Not necessarily belong to the institution, but he suggested a Catholic church. 

I went on the say that that would not happen. I do not believe in a god, or an afterlife. I did however say that I believe the afterlife or the soul is a metaphor for their continuing effect on a person or many people even after their death. 

He was not having that. 

To sum up the experience these are the questions that I have, and would like to discuss. 

* Is my therapist overstepping his boundaries in continuing to push this issue?

* Am I kidding myself in saying that my values and morals are not necessarily christian, or am I right to say that while christians may share similar values, my values simply human morality and commitment?]


UPDATE...Kinda: 

This thread exploded at about the exact same time all of the computers at work did...and it's my job to fix all those.

I'm reading through your responses now. 

Thank you for taking an interest and willingly sharing. I hope I sparked some good discussion as well. Will update again after reading through. 

**Another update:**

 I just wrote this long comment that pretty accurately describes my views on what I believe marriage is. For those of you who say it's just another institution, I think it may help clear up what I really mean, for those of you who still care.
[Long Ass Comment about my views on Marriage and People](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/13vqn9/i_think_i_need_to_find_a_new_therapist_due_to/c78m8wm)

As for what I need to do.

I have decided after reading all of the comments and attempted to find the time to respond when I can, that I will see this therapist once more, and bring this issue up, mostly to see what he says. If he accepts my view, I will continue to see him. As I have said, he is pretty intelligent, and has helped me work through some of my troubles. This is really the first time religion has come up. If he does not accept and/or continues to push the issue, I will be finding a new therapist, or possibly, move away from the therapy sessions all together. I might be getting close to that point as it is. 


I want to thank you all for taking an interest and voicing your views. This thread has actually helped me to come to understand my views on ""marriage"", relationships, and my atheistic views on life and morality better. I genuinely feel like it has helped me know myself better. Maybe this was good enough therapy!

This is why I love this subreddit. I've got 265 hours in Dark Souls 3. 

I suck at it. Hard. Even for the time I've got. 

Seriously I'm absolute garbage. 

This is for those mad dark spirits, those mound makers, who could just kill me and walk away with their prize, but instead, help me through. Assisting me and often dying before I do. 

You guys are better than the sunbros. 

Yeah. I said it. 

Shoutout to you guys. Or.. fix the servers...

Whichever seems easier. 

For me at least, drafting is one of my favorite parts of the game, especially in Captain's Draft. "

ShimShamWham,6,1,"Backstory: I'm a male (aged 26) in the military and in 6 months while I was overseas in Asia I went from 70 kg (155 lbs) at 162 cm (5'4"") to 59 kg (130 lbs). I basically just stayed on base, kept to myself, didn't tell anyone back home that I was losing weight or working out, and then came back home after retiring from the military and here are some interesting things that I noticed:

**Normal notes and tips:**

- Almost every attractive person I talk to looks me in the eyes and maintains eye contact whether they be male or female. Unattractive people typically avoid eye contact.

- In conversation, people seem much more interested on my opinions about things. I believe that when I was fat and out of shape, in general, people cared less because they assumed I was a lazy slob who wasn't important. 

- It took 3 months for hunger pains to go away after being in a caloric deficit. After that, my body, brain, and stomach in conjunction started realizing that not jamming a lot of food in my stomach wasn't going to kill me. It's okay to feel tired from it **some days**. If it starts happening all the time, start tracking your macros more carefully with MyFitnessPal or something like it.

- Some friends and family (most out of shape) were annoyed and bothered by my weight loss. Don't let it annoy you at first. If it persists and continues to hurt your relationship negatively, start thinking about cutting them out of your life a little bit. Some friends and family will be motivated by your progress, support them but don't be over-zealous. Give them tips and information but try to reiterate that what you did ""is what worked for you"". For example, I do not eat any candy or dessert ever because it leads me down a bad passageway to more calories, but some people can handle cheating like that once in a while with no problems.

- On the same note as the point above, make sure to point out that in the long term, calories in - calories out is the most important part of losing weight. ""Eating healthy"" by stuffing your face with organic salad and 5 servings of 700 calorie low gluten farm raised ceasar dressing every day will not do them any good. Encourage them to do their research on subs like this or /r/fitness to grow their knowledge. Again, don't shove it down their throats, let them bring it up and if they ask you then give your input. If they don't, then never bring it up in conversation, it's annoying and rude.

**TIPS FOR SHORT MEN:**

- In my experiences talking to very honest no-bullshit women, the large majority of girls are interested in short guys who have a novice-intermediate muscle base with a lean body. 12%-15% Body fat is ideal. Anything less than that would be too skinny, anything more than that wouldn't have a good enough facial structure. Too much muscle and many girls will assume you have ""napoleon complex"" and/or they simply don't like the weird proportions, too little muscle and you look like a skinny neckbeard. It differs from person to person, but for reference I'm about 13% body fat at 59 kg (130 lbs) and plan to gain basically no more muscle or fat weight as my body is at about the optimal size.

- You can be short and fit, but aesthetically smaller guys also have to be on top of their game in other categories to make up for their height. Find a cool trendy haircut that you like and take a picture of it to an expensive salon. Yes, you might need to save money to spend $30-40 on a haircut but the style and, more importantly, the confidence you gain from it will be worth it. After you get the initial expensive haircut, go to a cheaper place for the next 2 cuts, then on the 3rd go back to the expensive place and have the experts get it back to tip-top shape. Repeat.

- If you look young and can grow a beard, do it. Us short guys who also have baby faces can definitely struggle with women and in the professional/career world alike when we look like we're 16 years old. ""Professional beards"" can absolutely help. A barbershop will trim it for $7-9 if you don't know how. If you're short on money, look up youtube videos on how to trim your own beard. It's not difficult and worth the time/commitment investment.

- Dressing nice/trendy is extremely important for short guys. I personally have always had a decent fashion sense and know which stores to get what piece of clothing at. If you don't, bite the bullet and ask a female friend with good fashion sense to go shopping with you for a couple hours. She will not only know what stores to go to but will also critique you when you try clothes on. Pretty soon you will catch on to trends and won't need her to come.

- Finally, remember that being short isn't a death sentence. I'm not special or important by any means but because I take care of myself, workout, and most importantly eat right, I am well ahead of most all of my (taller) friends career and relationship wise. All it takes is that little extra effort every day to set myself apart from their complacent behavior. Family, bosses, coworkers, and women will all take notice whether you realize it or not.And... I think he's the next biggest rapper. He has the whole package man. Something I noticed about his songs is that none of them get old listening to them. They're catchy but complex enough at the same time. His flow is different from everyone else and his lyrics are special. Can't wait to see where this guy goes and I have no doubt he's going to be huge."
Aititeal,3,8,"[removed]So after the victory of SKT at Worlds last year, Marin wanted a skin for Renekton, so [here we go](http://imgur.com/bU5oVHb). 

&nbsp;

I drew this a while ago, but I choose to upload it only recently.

One day, I took my pencil and tried to imagine what could look like this skin, and the ""blade-weapon"" (called ""bat'leth"" I think) is inspired by SKT's logo.

I drew only Renekton because I usually draw only animals, and I like this champion also, so it was alot of fun to draw this :).

&nbsp;

I hope you like it :).Hello Reddit :).

I'm not a Widow main, but I like to play her. However, I think that  her venom mine is quite weak, and if it's certainly not the reason of her low pick rate in pro scene, I still think that this mine should recieve a little buff.

So my idea was to put vision on the enemies hit by the mine during some seconds. It doesn't have to be very long (she has already her ultimate), but some extra seconds of visibility on her targets could help, and it would be even more helpful for Widow to have the possibility to identify the enemies who come through the mine spot (because she would not react the same way if it was a pharah or a Reinhardt). So the mine could be more polyvalent.

Another idea could be to reduce the cooldown on the grappling hook to give her more mobility and escape against flankers, but I don't think it would make her more picked in pro scene.

What do you think about it ? Do you have some good ideas ? :)After reading the post from /r/chaosgamerguy21 about the [new Sombra clue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4xafoz/argnew_sombra_clue_found_on_user_performance_page/), I watched the video of the Zenyatta Gameplay Preview.
I found something interesting in the map King's Row.

&nbsp;

Here you can see the current map setting as we see it in game :
http://imgur.com/a/359nk

And HERE, you can see the map setting in the video :
http://imgur.com/a/0N9NM

&nbsp;

On the left, we can clearly see a portrait of a blue ""cyber woman"" with the mention ""Now playing"" below her face. This portrait doesn't exist in the current map.

&nbsp;

Another interesting fact is the name of the building : The Meridian. As many of you probably know, a meridian is a geographic imaginary line, and it's probably not a coincidence if Blizzard showed us the cardinal points as hints.
This poster is definitely related to Sombra imo, and it's probably her who is represented.

I noticed the number 629 on the bus, maybe it's related to the Sombra's ARG ?

&nbsp;

There are maybe some other hints that I could have missed in the video or in the map itself, and I'll keep searching some new tasty clues to find out more things about Sombra :D.

&nbsp;

Maybe there's something to find with the meridians, because every meridian is identified with a number, so maybe there is some solutions to the codes with the Mexican meridians 
(I think that the meridians which cross Mexico are number 90 to 130).

&nbsp;

I also found that on Wikipedia : ""The term ""meridian"" comes from the Latin meridies, meaning ""midday""; the sun crosses a given meridian midway between the times of sunrise and sunset on that meridian"".

So maybe Sombra is related to McCree ? Or maybe McCree IS Sombra ? Who knows ! xD

&nbsp;

Did someone find another clue or theory that I could have missed ? I just played a competitive game on Ilios, but when the ennemy Lucio ulted, his shield never decreased or ended. The ennemy team got a PERMANENT shield from Lucio's ult. It was not a visual bug but an actual shield (and the ennemy team didn't understand what was going on too). The only way to stop it was by killing them but the shield was regenerating over time (so ofc we couldn't kill them easily lol). So we lost the competitive game because of this bug.

Unfortunately, I have no record or screenshot of it, but I wanted to warn everyone about this problem. Maybe someone experienced the same bug ? I think it has to be fixed as soon as possible, before it ruins too many games.

EDIT : added some detailsAs you can see in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYJmDsN0kSg) (which is not mine), if you buy the Greater stealth totem (yellow trinket upgrade) and then undo the purchase, buy it again, undo it again, buy it again, and finally spam the ""undo"" button, the game will instantanly crash for all the players in the game (I tried to reproduce it in custom game with a friend and [we both got disconnected](http://i.imgur.com/iJmxey9.jpg)). And the disconnection seems to never end.

This bug is gamebreaking because it can be exploited to ""cancel"" a defeat. I think Riot should investigate that before many people try to exploit it.

So please Riot, fix it soon ;).


Edit : The trinket's upgrade was not disabled (at least on EUW) when I made this post, but now it's disabled ! Thank you Riot ! :DBecause when I hesitate to resurrect someone, I would like to know if his ultimate is up, so I could make my ults more impactful. But for now, when a teammate dies, the indicator of his ult is replaced by a death marker with the respawn timer. It would be better to have both indicators available. Also, it would be nice to have a display showing the current charge level of the teammates' ultimates so we can see if they will have their ultimate soon even when they don't communicate with us.
Considering how impactful the ultimates abilities can be, it would be a nice information to have.


Blizzard please :3.


PS : sorry for my English :/.And I'm not even talking about a release, or even a reveal. But when the countdown of the Sombra ""transmission"" ended, you HAD to give us SOMETHING ! Because you knew that the whole community had high expectations for the 100% of amomentincrime, and you knew that everyone would be disappointed if you didn't let something new for us.

&nbsp;

It could have been whatever you want, a picture, a voice line, a video, a screenshot, a hint about her gameplay, a clue about her lore, a new challenge to decipher, whatever, but not a huge amount of... nothingness...

&nbsp;

Even the smallest thing would have made us happier than this lame ""loading complete"". We needed something the community could talk about, speculate about or just enjoy. Now, everyone is disappointed and the hype is dying, because the waiting was so long (with nothing to ""feed"" the hype during the countdown), the expectations were so high, and in the end we have litteraly nothing more about Sombra, not even a little clue to continue the ARG. She doesn't interact with us anymore, she doesn't play with us, she just disappeared, and that let us with quite alot of frustration.

&nbsp;

I hope Blizzard will learn from that and make better teasing for the future heroes...[removed]"

It seems that Google will remove all user-uploaded videos on April 29.  I've seen some videos on there that are unavailable on Youtube, Metacafe, torrents etc.  What are some videos you like that Redditors would like or should download that would be removed in other places?

To far away to go to Comic-Con?  One of the 4,000 people in line that couldn't get in?  Don't fret!  Here's every concept art shown in the panel.

The pictures were all taken by me.

I'm going to show each picture in order, and say what they said about each as much as I can remember (this happened 8 hours ago).  If anyone reminds me of stuff I forgot, I'll add it to the appropriate picture.

P.S. I lied.  It's not actually every piece.  I missed about 3-4 pictures, as some went by really fast, but they weren't important.

This takes place 6 months after Book One btw:

**SECTION 1: Mardi Gras in the Water Tribe**

[Southern Water Tribe Festival](http://i.imgur.com/35z5q.jpg)  Bryan spent a while complimenting the art on this and the next few pictures.

[More Festival](http://i.imgur.com/DD3zf.jpg)  Again most commentary on how pretty it looks.

[EVEN MORE FESTIVAL](http://i.imgur.com/NYHY5.jpg)  and [number 2](http://i.imgur.com/jd4JA.jpg) (Because I was so close to the front, I couldn't take a picture of the entire thing).

I think they showed another picture of the festival for like 2 seconds, so I couldn't get it :(

**SECTION 2: Creepy and Spooky** (I'm separating them based on theme)

[Storm](http://i.imgur.com/RauWg.jpg)  There's a creepy, spooky storm going on.

[More Storm](http://i.imgur.com/gK7W8.jpg)  and [number 2](http://i.imgur.com/3wpjb.jpg) Bryan just repeated that it's creepy and spooky, and again, complimented the art.

[Iceberg/Storm](http://i.imgur.com/BNYtt.jpg)  Bryan said again that it's a creepy, spooky, supernatural storm, and said he liked the parallel with the iceberg and storm as it relates to Aang.

[Korra and Naga](http://i.imgur.com/IRGgI.jpg)  Korra seeing the storm.  Bryan said he liked how Naga looks like a wolf here.

[Some creepy Southern Water Tribe glacier thing](http://i.imgur.com/OySOk.jpg)  don't remember much about this.  I think Bryan said this was creepy too.

**SECTION 3: Spirituality**

[The Southern Air Temple](http://i.imgur.com/n0UeX.jpg)  Bryan said they wanted to give it a fresh look, so they updated how it looks.

[Sacred Air Nomad location](http://i.imgur.com/piQQf.jpg?1)  Not much I remember said about this.  A lost, spiritual place. 

[More Mountains](http://i.imgur.com/NEZN6.jpg)  They went by quickly on this one.

[Spiritual Place](http://i.imgur.com/iyCXT.jpg)  I'm blanking on this one.  I forgot what they said about it.  I don't think it's the Spirit World, but I think it's just a spiritual place.

[THE SPIRIT WORLD!!!](http://i.imgur.com/0o1xA.jpg)  They said they're visiting it.  And there's a couple episodes in the middle of the season that are really unique and cool.

**SECTION 4: Character Art**

[Korra](http://i.imgur.com/CQavo.jpg)  They updated her look.  They gave her an asymmetrical style.  And they like how she has arm bands that make her look buff.

[Mako](http://i.imgur.com/bpMEg.jpg)  This is his new winter look.

[Bolin](http://i.imgur.com/NBMul.jpg)  His new winter look.

[Asami](http://i.imgur.com/6O3jn.jpg)  Her new updated look.  She's now more mature since she's running her father's business.

[Tenzin](http://i.imgur.com/5I5TV.jpg) and [number 2](http://i.imgur.com/FkQtt.jpg)  They said this is his winter look, and now he's probably wearing 5 robes.

[Bumi](http://i.imgur.com/DCKWK.jpg)  They said he'll have a bigger role in Book Two.  He's not related to Bumi, but he has that Bumi spirit.  He's wearing an old army surplus jacket, and that over the 6 months, he got a pot-belly.  For his winter look, they said they thought it would be funny to add the pink earmuffs.

[Bumi's faces](http://i.imgur.com/VaAOj.jpg)  They complimented the art on this.

[Kya](http://i.imgur.com/5HnoG.jpg) and [number 2](http://i.imgur.com/Ja3Tj.jpg)  They said she's appearing.  She's a free-spirit and independent.  (I think they used the word ""hippie"" also).

[Senna](http://i.imgur.com/BUIxh.jpg)  Korra's mom.  This is her new, normal look.

[Senna's winter look](http://i.imgur.com/My3vo.jpg)  He said this was the one we were familiar with.

[Tonraq](http://i.imgur.com/wDNtN.jpg) Korra's dad in his winter look.

[Tonraq's new look](http://i.imgur.com/NXpIj.jpg)

[Tonraq's faces](http://i.imgur.com/jlOss.jpg) and [number 2](http://i.imgur.com/1eiiJ.jpg)

[Tonraq shirtless](http://i.imgur.com/lbmf8.jpg)  They said they wanted him to be this strong, menacing guy, but still kind.  They said that Korra was based off of some MMA fighter, and her dad was a linebacker.

[Unalok/Unarok](http://i.imgur.com/qL0d0.jpg) and [number 2](http://i.imgur.com/dOAq4.jpg)  He's Tonraq's brother, and chief of the Northern Water Tribe.  He's a wise and spiritual man, unlike his brother, and provides a professor/mentor role for Korra.

Video coming up after the break! (It took me an hour to do all of this, I need a break)

Also, about the panel, there was no audience Q&A.  They talked about Book One.  Read lines from it, and did this.

And there's no official spelling of Unalok/Unarok or Desna.  I just said what I heard.  But I did sit near the front.  I thought it was Unalok, but everyone on the internet is saying Unarok.  Maybe it's not even Desna, but Dave.  My ears took it pretty badly since everyone was screaming before that.  Since I can't find any name for him, I'm just going to say that both twins are probably unnamed.

The 1947 book *McElligot’s Pool* will stop being published because of [this page](https://i.imgur.com/463NidC.png). I think this page could have just had the minor edit of changing ""Eskimo"" to ""Inuit"" or ""Arctic"" and there would be nothing wrong with it.

The 1955 book *On Beyond Zebra!* will stop being published because of....I'm not actually sure. For the following two, the claims of ""racist imagery that is hurtful"" doesn't really apply to anything in the book. My best guesses are [this page](https://i.imgur.com/mD1mOGa.png) for referencing Christopher Columbus or [this page](https://i.imgur.com/wpZETUY.png) for depicting Orientalist-esque clothing.

The 1953 book *Scrambled Eggs Super!* is probably the least egregious of these. Again, I don't know where the racism is. It's either [this page](https://i.imgur.com/KVnQnne.png) or these two pages: https://i.imgur.com/mt5zeYe.png https://i.imgur.com/UsErcGa.png

The last book is the 1976 *The Cat’s Quizzer*, but I can't find a copy anywhere online. The pages on the [Wikia](https://seuss.fandom.com/wiki/The_Cat%27s_Quizzer) don't have anything offensive. EDIT: /u/sharperview informed me that it might be because of [this page](https://boundingintocomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021.03.02-07.00-boundingintocomics-603e8b434e3a4.png).

Overall, I think some of these books didn't deserve to be pulled. I genuinely don't understand what's wrong with *Scrambled Eggs Super!* for example. I think this is another example of companies making meaningless and performative changes for PR purposes, that ultimately don't have any material benefit (nor hurt their bottom line)."

silenttim,6,8,"Just upgraded and no longer need it. This is a dual core video card, essentially two 670/680's on one card. I'm the original purchaser and have kept it very clean. I would say in excellent condition.

You pay for shipping. **Asking $300**I just ordered a Denon AVR-X1200W.  My living room is about 18' x 11'.  My TV is situated on one of the long walls, with the couch being on the opposite long wall.  We probably sit about 8'-9' away from the TV. I have need some help deciding on what speakers to purchase.  So here are the choices I have currently been considering.

* Pioneer SP-PK52FS Andrew Jones 5.0 Home Theater Speaker Package 
* 4x Micca MB42X Bookshelf Speakers with a Micca MB42X-C Center Channel Speaker
* 2x Infinity Primus P363BK's with a Infinity PC251BK Center Channel Speaker

We pretty much just watch movies/tv.  I want clear speech more than anything. $600 is really what I would like to stay around for price.  If there is something else that would be superior for the money, I would love the input.

I'll either be going with a Dayton Sub-1000, SUB-1200, or a BIC F12.  I'm open to suggestions on which one I can get away with.

**I ended up ordering:**

* **2x Boston Acoustics Classic II CS26 2-Way 6-1/2-Inch Bookshelf Speaker**
* **1 Boston Acoustics Classic II CS225C Center Channel Loudspeakers**
* **1 Dayton Audio SUB-1200 12-Inch 120 Watt Powered Subwoofer**

**Big thanks to u/000Destruct0, u/ZeosPantera, and everyone else for the shared insight!**
I always get a little bit confused on what I should re-roll on items.  What do you consider to be the order of importance for item properties?  

I know its not going to be exactly the same for every gear slot, but a general breakdown would be awesome.

""Can I get a lobster to go? Live? That one,"" she says as she points to what's probably an 8-pounder. At $28 per pound.

We don't normally do this, but she's insistent, so we wrap up ol' Clawy McClawface in wet newspaper, stuff him in a box, and he's on his way. She was not interested in our suggestions for the best way to prepare him.

About a month or so later, she's back. She wants another lobster. We oblige. This time, our chef happens to be up front, and he asks her how she plans to prepare it?

""Oh, I'm not eating it, ugh. Every month I save up and buy one so I can return him to the sea!""

As the FOH manager, I had the unfortunate task of explaining to her that a Maine Lobster, like the ones she was buying, come from deep, cold waters where the temperature is in the low 40's. She's walking down to the beach and tossing it in 95-degree Florida water, nothing more than an exotic snack for a passing bull shark or ray.

She cried and told me I was wrong. I bet she still hates me to this day.

Cale017,4,7,"I understand that for many of us, most likely the sort who are most likely to see a post like this in the first place, FFXIV is very much a grind. We're at end game content, trying to run our roulettes and raids with the highest efficiency possible. It's understandable, time is a precious commodity and when you're already dedicated upwards of a few hours to a game each day, you might not want to spend any longer than what's strictly necessary doing anything other than rushing for the end of any given bit of content.

However, the New Adventurer icon should give us all reason to slow down, if not pause altogether from time to time, and explain things to new players.

I recently ran into some trouble doing a levelling roulette as Dragoon. The Scholar and the Paladin were both level 60, full anima weapons and everything, while the Archer was only level 16. He was having some issues keeping Venomous Bite and Straight Shot up, but it wasn't a big hassle, and he'd learned enough to know when he should be using single target or AoE. However, he was getting roughed up by the tank and healer for ""slowing them down."" When he went off and pulled a mob on his own, one that's in the natural path along Sastasha but not necessary to speed run through it, the Scholar immediately started going off on the poor guy while I calmly explained that it isn't a DPS's job to pick fights in a dungeon, and to stick closer to the tank. I then tried to get the Scholar to calm down by reminding him that the guy was clearly still learning, earning myself a verbal lashing and a kick from the party.

This game has an amazing community of friendly, helpful players, but like any competitive environment there will always be those who take it all just a bit too seriously. Seeing that sort of behavior is not okay, however, especially not to someone who's opinion of the game is still being worked out. One of the best parts of FFXIV, for me, has been all the random people who were willing to slow down when it was my first time in a dungeon so I could appreciate the journey in a new area, or the people who would give me great tips as we played together. It isn't terribly difficult to recognize a new/otherwise ignorant player in this game, but the response to meeting one should not be disdain.

With boost potions becoming a possibility now, I think it's important to remember that we've all had to learn along the way. New dungeons, new ways of looking at your rotation as you levelled, new sorts of mechanics. A laundry list of little things that take time to really internalize and make second nature. Even veteran players from other games, even if using a boost potion doesn't give you the sprout icon, will still have a learning curve to tackle as they're thrown into endgame content, no matter how supportive the friends around them might be.

Try to take the time to educate fresh players before you chastise them. I don't think any of us were perfect from the get go, especially in a game where perfection is constantly evolving. You don't help the community any by shaving two minutes off your run of a dungeon, but you could make someone's day by taking those two minutes to explain something to them instead.When the sudden appearance of a Zamtrios during a fishing mission is more of a nuisance than a threat.

Show everyone why you love what you do! 

EDIT: THIS WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, GOOD JOB EVERYONEAside from the excellent low level gear, and the ring that gives a solid chunk of stats and an exp boost, the skills it teaches you are invaluable.

It was a long day today. I got home from work at about 4am, and by the time I'd helped an FC member with some stuff and turned my attention to continuing to level my bard, queued up for levelling roulette, and gotten into Brayflox, it was about 5.

The level 32 Paladin in the party didn't know how to gain or hold aggro, their rotations, or even how to find gear to equip better stuff in their armoury chest. I was wholly unprepared mentally to try and teach someone, but it was better than ditching and having to wait half an hour to queue up in another likely half hour queue and try to get into another dungeon for that sweet, sweet exp.

So myself and the healer started trying to tutor this guy. He was having a ton of connection issues, especially towards the latter half, and I ended up tanking Aiatar with my Bard because the guy dropped out and just didn't get back in until the fight was almost done. Didn't want to kick him if he was still trying, but we weren't going to wait around when we'd already been in there for over forty minutes. When we COULD talk to the guy, I asked if he'd done the Novice stuff, and he said he had considered it but hadn't done it. After explaining that it would answer a lot of the questions he'd been having, he agreed to do it as soon as we were out of the dungeon.

Honestly, it doesn't matter if you're above the level for the Hall. If you're even remotely unclear on anything your role is supposed to do, go through the Hall's training. It's an invaluable resource to helping you learn a role that you're unfamiliar with, probably more helpful for tanks than for anyone else. It's not going to tell you how to play your class at level 60, but it will tell you the things you should be keeping in mind as you continue levelling. For DPS, how not to sap aggro, how to balance your DoTs, how to go through your damage combos. For tanks, how to gain and keep aggro, how to recognize when a party member is in trouble, how to go about a good pull, and your aggro combo. For healers, how to watch over the party from afar. How to measure when you can do your own damage and when you should be focusing on healing. How to balance healing multiple party members at a time.

These are general skills that are absolutely necessary to play any class, any role, sufficiently. SE has put in an amazing resource, with something for players of all levels in one way or another, but mainly for all those sprouts we've got running around. If you're new, learn from it. If you're a veteran, run it for the ring and to learn what all it offers so you can better tutor newer players. Mentors, encourage sprouts to go through the Hall's training when they're the right level for it so they learn sooner rather than later. 

I don't mean this as an insult, or to come across as overly harsh, but at this point there is no excuse for not knowing how to play a class during low level play. Before there was a bit of a learning curve since tanks and healers could only really learn how to do their jobs while in parties, and the best way for that was in a dungeon. But no one should be going into so much as Sastasha without having learned what the Hall of the Novice has to teach. It can only help, and it all only takes about an hour to go through.

People are going to do as they please in the end, sometimes to the detriment of the three other people who are lumped with them. You have the means to learn what you need to. If you elect not to use them, don't be surprised when people don't want to put up with their runs being made slow, ineffective, or even impossible. But I implore you: give the Hall a try if you're learning the game. There is absolutely no shame in it. I'm much more willing to teach someone who's gone the extra mile to try and teach themselves than someone who's walking into a level 50 dungeon and thinking that spamming Flash with a Warrior is a good way to clear content, or that DoTs are optional DPS with a Bard.

Ideally, you're helping you help yourself. At worst, you're helping more experienced players help you. Just give it a shot, you might be surprised at how much you can learn before you're ever in a place where people are relying on you to already know.

TL;DR: Loot and lessons in the Hall. Do it for your sake as much as everyone's else.I'm going to put another spoiler warning here, because I'm gonna be discussing events very late in the game, up to the ending. I will not be using spoiler tags as this entire post would look like an FBI document. Please, be warned. I have my frustrations with the game but if you haven't played through it yourself yet I don't want my complaints to paint your image of the game going in. 

To a point, this is partly me venting my frustrations, but I'd like to think my frustrations come from a valid place.

Is there something I missed? I got this game on launch day and due to a myriad of reasons, mostly work, wasn't able to finish it although I did get a good ways in, up to where you're carting Iris around. Meanwhile my roommate burns through it and starts hounding me to get on it, which didn't make me want to play any more.

But, I finally sat down and went through the rest of it. And my roommate is completely aghast that I haven't enjoyed the story in the slightest. 

From what I could tell, it all started out pretty well. Simple set up, Noctis has to go marry Luna, then behind the scenes his nation gets attacked and now his priority is getting things back under control.

Major spoilers are starting now, so this is the final warning.

And then everything just sorta... spiraled. Character arcs vanished, *characters* vanished, only to reappear sometime later either dead or unrecognizable... if they even got screentime in the first place. Hell, I had to look up the name of the demon who chases you in chapter 13 after I killed him when I realized that he was a named character, and only then because in the middle of that hectic fight I caught the subtitles on screen with the name. 

If I'd had subtitles off, I literally would not have even known that I had killed off a transformed named character. The goddamn emperor of the country that wrecked Noctis' life, and I didn't even know I'd killed him.

Literally every story decision makes me wonder ""why?"" Why was Ardyn treated like shit for being a healer back in his day? Why does Noctis have to die to get rid of Ardyn? Why couldn't the kings just share their power with him, which is what I thought the entire purpose of the Ring of the Lucii was? Why did Noctis have to spend ten years stuck in the crystal? Was he going through training? Probably not, given that he had no idea of how much time has passed. Why did he wake up on a random island with a note from his friends and his father's boat left there for him? Did the crystal dump him there with everything he needed? Did he leave much sooner and was comatose so they found a hiding spot for him? If so, why leave him in a spot that's a stone's throw from demons with no one guarding his helpless body?

What did Ardyn stand to gain? He already knew he wasn't going to be the king. Was he just trying to end the world in a huge hissy fit over not being chosen? He sounds like a created villain, someone who got turned into what he ended up as instead of being born that way, and yet for all intents and purposes he's just a force of nature standing in Noctis' way, who had literally nothing to do with the reasons Ardyn got cursed. And was I supposed to recognize the bodies hanging up in the throne room? I'm pretty sure one was Regis, but the others were toss-ups. One could have been Luna, or Noctis' mother, one could have been the emperor, one guy just looked like some rando from Regis' retinue. If they wanted me to feel for these characters, why didn't I see any of them die save for one, *who died in a movie?*

Why was Ravus bouncing back and forth from hating Noctis to supporting him, literally in two different flashbacks in the same sequence. Why did he steal Regis' sword only to try and give it back to Noctis, supposedly? And why did I find out about that from a random old lady instead of Ravus himself??

If Shiva was dead, and you even look at her giant body, why did Gentiana somehow magically become Shiva? Do the gods reincarnate after they're killed? Was Gentiana always Shiva? If so, what was the purpose of being the messenger of the gods if she WAS a god?

Why was communing with the gods killing Luna, or at least I assume that's what was happening? It was never clearly established what exactly she was giving her life up for. Is it that she gives it up to summon them, or did she know ahead of time that Ardyn was going to kill her? Why would the Oracle only be able to get through three out of six communions before she becomes too weak to continue?

What the hell was Solheim? Why was it introduced once, never spoken of again, never lead up to before?

If I needed all six blessings to be the true king, how did I ascend with only 5? 

How the hell did Ignis still fight and cook when he was blinded? Did he develop Daredevil-level senses? If he did, why the hell wasn't that a larger point?

If this is all just to fit into some prophecy, it means that literally no choice you or anyone else made in the story actually matters. Noctis was going to be the one to kill Ardyn, and everyone else is just there to make sure he can do so. There's no real agency anywhere in the story. 

Pieces of plot have **clearly** been either left on the cutting room floor for whatever reason or purposefully removed to hamfistedly shove into DLC, which at this point I don't care to buy. 

I waited ten years for this game. Constantly checking for new info, almost like a routine for the last decade. The first of every month, I'd go digging. There were a few times that the thought of Versus XIII kept me going through some dark stuff. Ten years later and I'm a more successful person, I've grown and changed and am stronger, whatever crutches I used to need.

But MAN, knowing that I spent all that time waiting for this?

What happened, man? I know that overhyping something is a good way to get disappointed, but even in the beginning this showed so much promise. If the rest of the game had progressed the way the first handful of chapters had, it might have been amazing. But instead I got railroaded from one situation to another faster than I could understand what was happening, and faster than the game could even explain why. When it bothered to.

I've seen the arguments that one of the developers said the narrative shifts were on purpose, but to me that doesn't reduce how choppy it is. Having the narrative pacing match the character's understanding is okay... to a point. In a movie you're confused for maybe an hour before things start coming together. I spent upwards of 20 hours of my playtime, roughly what I've done in the past few days, completely confused. 

I had zero emotional stakes in what was happening around me. Luna died and I didn't even care. Ravus died and I didn't care. 

*Noctis died and I didn't even care.*

The closest to emotional stakes I had with anything in this story was the relationship between the main four, and even that was tenuous at best. Mostly because I'd watched Brotherhood so knew their backstories. But then they go and fuck that up by making DLC chapters for each of the other three to explain what I have to assume are some pretty major character development periods given the changes you see after each one has left for whatever reason.

Hell, Prompto just randomly drops the bomb that he's *not even human* and it's given about five seconds of gravity before quickly being brushed aside.

""Well there's more story in the DLC, it clears things up.""

That isn't what I waited a decade for, though. I paid 60 dollars for FFXV. If they wanted me to pay 90 bucks for the full experience, make the game 90 bucks. If things were being shoved into DLC because of time restraints, oh fucking well. We already waited this long, what's another few months while they just slot in the bits where they naturally went.

I'm fine with roundabout storytelling. I'm fine with hidden storytelling. I'm fine with a sense of mystery and suspense, with not always having all of the information. But I'm NOT fine with *bad* storytelling, and everything I just played through leaves me feeling nothing but negativity towards the way the story was presented here.

The strongest feelings I had for this game were when it was starting out. When it was just hunting monsters and killing time camping. When the story came in, my enjoyment of the game went to hell.

FFXV was supposed to be a great game. Instead it feels good at best overall, carried heavily by the first portion. After that, everything just goes up in smoke.

And then, even with everything else, as I was fighting Ardyn I was starting to get really into it. A one on one fight, even if I didn't like not having the rest of the crew with me. Then they both activate their abilities and start flying around (another question: how the hell did Ardyn have access to all of these abilities when we see that Noctis practially had to kill himself along the way to get them and he WAS the Chosen King) flashing lights and the city blurring past as we soared into the sky.

And then I realized that I could literally hold square until I got low on health and then hold L1 and become effectively invincible while I healed up, only to continue my unstoppable assault. Then you crash back down, a sliver of your max health, and Ardyn tells you it's to be a war of attrition.

What he meant was, it's a war of downing potions between his attacks because you literally do not have enough hp to survive his barrages and retaliate, you can't run, you can't dodge, you can't do anything. It took me five minutes to finish him because literally all I could do was take three steps, get hit, and pop another elixir.

I didn't even beat the final boss because I was powerful. I beat him because I had about 20 elixirs left over from my earlier preparations. Without those I honestly do not think I could have beaten him given how much health he has, how much damage you deal (I was level 43 at the time, and the Sword of the Father was all I had available to use at that point) and how little downtime you have between his attacks.

In the final moments, when I was finally starting to get hyped up for the grand scope of the battle if nothing else, I'm immediately pulled out of my immersion.

I can't be the only one who feels like this game utterly failed to deliver on a ten year promise, am I? Under all the frustration and confusion, I still love this game. I waited so long for it, it feels like closing a chapter of my life.

I see the potential here. I really do. The combat is fantastic, when it wants to let me actually block something and when I know what combo I'm using. The game is drop dead freaking gorgeous. The music is fantastic as ever. And the makings of a good story ARE in there, somewhere. The tragedy of the characters, the way everyone's goals and motivations wove in and out and around each other. But none of it matters when the game trivializes everything down to a prophecy that robs the main character of his agency, and completely forgets to give major characters an ounce of closure. Or even concrete development to close upon.

And that's honestly the closest parallel I can draw between this game and the sensation of closing this long chapter of my life. 

A ton of shit happened, I have no idea what all I had any choice in, and I'm even more confused now than I was when I began. I'm more sad that this game didn't make me feel anything close to what it was clearly trying to make me feel than I am sad at the story itself.

FFXV is unfinished. The gameplay is almost a mirror sheen, save for the odd combat issues, but the story is an absolute mess. Not only do I feel that DLC can't fix this, but I feel that DLC shouldn't be considered as an option to fix a game's story. Either the one out of the box is a complete experience and the DLCs expand on it, or you've essentially just bought two thirds of a 90 dollar game and didn't realize it.This is a bit of an old story, but I was reminiscing with some friends and thought at least a few folks here might get a kick out of it.

A lot of the RPGs that take place in my main group are set in established universes outside of the D&D standard fare. This one particular campaign took place in the world of Magic the Gathering, on the plane of Zendikar. For those of you not in the know, which given this sub I figure is maybe two, the basic idea is that there are a bunch of multiverses in Magic the Gathering which form the setting for each block of cards. This particular setting is a world that's incredibly rich with mana, the resource used both in the game and in the lore for magical spells, but is being plagued by Eldrazi, your regular ol' fashioned eldritch horrors beyond mortal comprehension who only even have physical form because they're forced to manifest some kind of one in order to exist on a plan and outside of that are just some vague ominous wave of death who prey on the mana of planes and leave an empty void in their wake.

That old schtick.

Our campaign takes place post the final battle against the Eldrazi on this world, and our party is going from area to area trying to restore the mana to the areas that had been damage. Where once there was lush greenery, rolling hills, high forests, and flowing rivers there is only bone and lifeless ash. But Zendikar is hardy, and it can be revived.

My character is a mute half-elven animist, a special group of people on Zendikar who can quite literally animate the land, and so I'm using a modified version of a Druid from 5e with some custom spells. The general feel is the same, just some flavor changes. As a result of his half-elf lineage, his animist powers release without form or direction when he speaks, and so remains silent at all times lest he cause natural disasters in the immediate area.

Oh, the irony.

Along our way, after going to talk to some goblins for directions to nearby concentrations of mana crystals, we return to the village who gave us a tip to talk to the gobbos. While the members of the party who can talk go to collect our reward from the mayor, I go off and see if there's anyone I can help nearby. When some townspeople see me and figure out I'm an animist (it was probably either the staff, the green clothing, or the giant walking pet golem who follows me everywhere) they point me in the direction of a farm not far from town where the workers are having a difficult time getting any crops to grow due to the local area being drained, although not fully, of mana. 

Figuring that this was well within my duties to attend to, I promptly go to attend to it. After a bit of meditation, I find that there's enough mana to grow the crops in the area, but due to the dirt being mixed with the drained soil from nearby the plants are having a difficult time finding the nutrition they need. My powers, unfortunately, do not extend to filtering out the bad dirt from the good dirt, but using my knowledge of natural life I figure that I can create a controlled fire and use try to re-fertilize the land, similar to what happens during volcanic eruptions.

Without enough pre existing plant life to nurture I use a Wall of Thorns to create a relatively thick circular area of overgrowth on the plots of land and advise, via emphatic waving of the arms, for the farmhands to back away. Then I roll a fireball, saying I want it to be concentrated on the center of the thorns. The die falls on 20 and the GM is silent for a moment before he nods and rolls a few dice, then tells me to roll a dexterity check for my golem, which it somehow passes on a 17.

Not sure of what just happened, and going under the natural assumption that my 20 means I succeeded in my goals, the GM informs me that I had indeed created a fireball right where I wanted it to be, but the sheer force of the explosive blast sent flaming chunks of vine and thorn all around the area, and it was only the speed of my golem jumping in the way that saved me. The farmhands, animals, and nearby farmhouse however were not so lucky. 

Standing amidst a smoldering plot of land, some of the nearby bodies visibly smoking with massive thorns protruding from their chests, legs, and in one guy who failed his check on a one, both eyes and his crotch, I realize that my plan has gone horrifically wrong. 

At least in the short term. The GM informs me that due to my success on the dice roll, the nearby area has indeed been blasted with fertile ash and further attempts to grow crops will work amazingly. So there's that.

Rushing back to the village to try and bring my party back with me, hoping that something could be salvaged of the situation or that I could try and at least let the townspeople know their only half functioning farm had just been blown to smithereens, the party is actually on their way out, bags of gold and shiny new weapons in hand. One of them happily tosses me a new staff capable of animating objects based on a charge, and whistles as he walks past, grabbing my shoulder and leading me along. The party is celebrating far too much for my attempts to get them to come with me to work, and the rather dull goblin berserker mistakes my flailing arms for celebration entirely, joining me in what he believes is some secret elven dance much to the party's enjoyment. Knowing that he can't risk trying to vocalize what just happened without risk of causing more damage to the village, or potentially killing his... well, not *friends* but accomplices, he gives up and just goes along with them guiltily.

As we leave the immediate area of the town my character looks back towards the billowing tower of smoke on the far side of the village, and my enhanced elf hearing lets me pick up on the sounds of villagers shouting about an emergency, all while my golem trudges along picking bits of steaming plant from the crevices of its form.In more ways than one.

First off, it's a drop dead gorgeous area. It feels huge, epic, and empty. Very much like something where civilization used to thrive, but has been taken over. The deeper you go, the greater the corruption becomes. I've always loved stuff like that, Lost City of Amdapoor is far and above my favorite dungeon. I went into Mhach today and was absolutely floored by it from start to finish from just a design perspective.

Unfortunately, I was also floored by the difficulty. I'm i223 with my Ninja and I was *extremly* excited for this patch as it was the first time I was ever going to be geared up enough to tackle any content that came out based on my ilvl. As someone who's had to work a lot, and take periodic breaks from the game, I've always been really behind the curve. By the time I got to stuff, people had already figured out the best strategies. Where to stand, where to place alliances, yadda yadda. I have a competitive streak a mile wide, and not really being able to compete has always irked me, but it's also driven me to try and do my absolute best. So in the days leading up to 3.3 I was pounding out roulettes, trying to get as much done as possible, even if I'm still a week and a half away from getting my 230 weapon. 

So I went in with my FC and was involved for the first time. A few had already run it in the past few days while I've been a bit too busy working to have my hand at it, and they had a general feel for it. But we were still very much trying to work everything out, and working alongside the other alliances. It was probably the first time I ever saw the healer LB3 used in a raid, and I even got to fire off a Chimatsuri on the last boss myself. It was an amazing feeling pushing myself to the edge of my abilities to react to what was happening around me, to balance having to keep my DPS as high as possible while going through mechanics since we were all walking a knife's edge. With so little room to give on either one, I felt truly pressured and challenged.

Honestly, I might not have made it through with my sanity intact if not for what is my best experience thus far with my new FC. I've had issues with FCs on my server in the past, my best friend ditching for other servers, the ones I've tried to join falling apart due to inactivity or drama. And I always shied away from the larger ones thinking them to be, on the whole, shallow and superficial. But I gave one of the largest on my server a try and have found that while I still don't know where I stand in everyone's eyes, I have the opportunity to join one of the raiding statics come the end of the week and I'm slowly making friends there. Even as we were wiping, our brains getting fried from our foreheads pushed up against the grinding stone, we were joking and laughing and having such a good time that my housemates had to come tell me to try and keep my voice down since they could hear me all throughout the house.

For probably the first time I can think of since I started playing this game, I felt like I was part of something massively multiplayer, surrounded by people who were striving for excellence like myself. And while I was pressured to do my best for the sake of succeeding, I wasn't being pressured by random people around me for messing up *x* mechanic or not doing *x* DPS on average.

With the Weeping City, I've found myself forging ahead into unknown territory, surrounded by allies who are relying on me as much as I was relying on them, strategizing as we go, and all while enjoying a truly gorgeous sight the entire way through.

This raid is pretty much everything I've hoped for since I first started playing this game, and it's why FFXIV is the only sub based game I'm willing to pay for."

Nitrozzy7,10,9,"Here's the [link] (http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2010/07/the-psychology-of-immersion-in-video-games/)

TL;DR Very good read, if you're into game design (or story telling for that matter). It constructs a better understanding of what makes a game immersive.

The article refers to the Theory of Spatial Presence (aka, Immersion), where Players form a representation in their minds of the space or world with which the game is presenting them and begin to favour the media-based space (I.e., the game world) as their point of reference for where they “are” (or to put it in psychological terms, their “primary ego reference frame”)

Then, continues with defining Game Characteristics Leading to Spatial Presence, grouping them into two general categories: those that create a rich mental model of the game environment and those that create consistency between the things in that environment. And afterwards, refers to each player's ability to immerse themselves in the game's world.

Finally concludes by stating that completeness of sensory information (how good of a job the game does at providing you with information about the its world through more than just text, like sound) means that the fewer blanks about the mental model of the game world that the player has to fill in, the better. Additionally states that, cognitively demanding environments, where players have to focus on what’s going on, can also be good for immersion. Then highlights the importance of a gripping story and plot, and the technical aspects of the game.

So, lets talk immersion... Can you think of any good examples? What do you think factored in making the game immersive for you? I've being playing Skyrim and Shadow Warrior for quite some time, but getting used to the first person perspective when it comes to melee combat, seems quite the challenge for me brain. I've tried maxing out the FOV and capping the frame-rate at 60fps with V-synch, but I still can't get used to it. It seems as if I'm not made for it, even though I have no problem with fist person shooters.

To my understanding, melee combat evolves all the senses of one's being, but in games the only senses that the player can capitalise upon is the ones of sight and time. Ergo, it becomes unsettling or confusing when there is more than one opponent that engages in melee combat with the player (or even if that one mob gets outside of the player's FOV mid combat).

However, when the perspective changes to third person, all is well. I remember playing Flable and again Skyrim in third person, and it just felt right!

Now, this problem appears to work in a vice versa short of way with third person shooters like Gears of War. Meaning, there;s also something unsettling with third person shooters. Though I haven't spent enough time playing one to be sure about anything.

Do you think that this is the case with you, or it really is just me?"
wakuku,5,5,"... I think it's bullshit that places of worship are exempt from such guidance. Its all or nothing. The virus doesn't care about your religion. No logical reason for this exemption except to please the idiots.1. The all seeing glass ball that Saruman was using. What is it really?  Gandalf mentioned something about it being a rare and dangerous object. Is it like the rings? Are there anymore magical items in the middleearth?

2. Elves leaving on boats to the undying lands. I know that the world is flat and if I remember correctly, there is an edge that they can pass through to somewhere. What is the purpose of such endeavors? Did all elves of Middle Earth suddenly left or just the important people? Who decides who can go and leave? If I remember correctly from an article, only elves are allowed to go. The rest dies... What happened to the Baggins?

3. Are there trade outside of middle earth? Im guessing since there are pirates and such men are there lands and kingdoms that rivals Gondor? Is that where the easterlings comes from?

tedsmitts,10,9,"It's time for the finale!Hello, /r/UnresolvedMysteries LTL FTP.

Just wanted to do an update as I lurk this sub fairly frequently and was interested in this case. There is a very detailed summary by /u/adocica previously posted to this sub: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/63e99s/a_24_years_old_disappeared_last_week_and_left_14/


Essentially, this young man disappeared from his home, leaving behind a bizarre scene in his room. 14 encoded manuscripts, esoteric writings on the wall, and a life-sized statue of philosopher Giordano Bruno in the center of his room.

He has since come home. I don't think the case was covered much in English media outside of the ""News of the Weird"" sections.

(articles are not in English but google translate or chrome does quite well with them)

Bruno returns home: http://g1.globo.com/ac/acre/noticia/apos-quase-5-meses-desaparecido-bruno-borges-retorna-para-casa-em-rio-branco.ghtml

Bruno attempts an explanation: http://g1.globo.com/ac/acre/noticia/bruno-borges-diz-que-arriscou-a-vida-e-integridade-para-despertar-sociedade-adoecida.ghtml 

>Eight days after returning home , student Bruno Borges, 25, says that in the nearly five months he has been missing, he has sought to find himself on a ""mystical journey of the soul."" In an interview with G1 , whose questions were answered by e-mail, he reaffirmed that isolating himself was part of the project to 'find the truth of life' and awaken a 'sick society'.


>""I had notion that the Philosopher's Stone was within the dark land, so I went after entering this dark land to find it. In the same way that the hero enters the cave to kill a dragon and that Jonas entered a whale, I also dived into the sea of ​​the unconscious in order to rescue me, ""he explained.

The police appear to be of the opinion that this was all a publicity stunt to garner attention for his writings, the first volume of which has been published and rose to between 24-30 on the weekly non-fiction bestseller list. Notably, furniture from Bruno's room was found in a friend's house, another friend was in possession of contracts agreeing to split some of the money from the book sales.

Sorry if the thread is a mess, I don't post long threads much. 

tl;dr - Bruno is safe, planned the disappearance, and it was likely all a publicity stunt. You can buy his book if you want."

However, Ostankino tower is in the north of Moscow, and if we are facing the rising sun, we should be looking at the northeastern part of the city, not the city center or the gardens. Also, the botanical gardens are to the north of the tower, so even if the sun were in the right spot, we should be looking away from the city center, not towards it. Literally unplayable.

Link to part 2: https://youtu.be/5Pr4Rr-aQLY (hd processing is still ongoing, so it is only 360p at the moment)I've played through Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light at least five times each. Loved both games. On Metro 2033 I played on Ranger difficulty and on Last Light I played Survival Ranger. Both of these difficulties felt realistic but not punishing, with headshots against enemies being killing blows.

&#x200B;

I started Metro Exodus last night and the difficulties seem totally messed up to me. The way damage is dealt to enemies on Ranger Hardcore feels right to me, but the player character dies far too easily: I poke my head out for 2 seconds and I am killed in one hit. Because of this, I switched to normal difficulty and I have the complete opposite problem: I can take many (too many) hits before dying, but headshots against mutants seem to have no effect, requiring 4 to take down a watchman.

&#x200B;

Am I missing something here, or are the difficulty levels a total departure from the previous two games? Can someone explain to me how damage to the player character and damage to enemies are modified by each difficulty level? Should I split the difference and play on Hardcore? Why is there no vanilla Ranger difficulty as in previous games (as opposed to Ranger Hardcore)? If there are any fixes/mods that deal with this issue, please let me know. Thanks for the help!"

yoshi570,9,6,"I've seen many people being puzzled about this scene in the post-episode post, so I decided to make a full new post to detail it a bit more.

###I. The context of Chuck's death

The scene starts with Jimmy looking for a new job. He looks for a new job because that means being busy, which means not dealing with his brother's death. He wants to stay active, because being active means that all this has meaning. That he is still on a path. That all this time working to become a lawyer, all the fights with his brother, they would still be part of a bigger picture where it ends well for Jimmy. 

###II. The Jimmy approach

Jimmy enters the interview, and is his charming self. He makes people confortable, he is nice and attentive to people, their needs and reactions. We saw this Jimmy notably when he was working with elder people. He would take hours to discuss about grandkids, and even though in the end he would do it for the money, there was a genuine part of him that cared about these elders. That genuine care was proven when he went back to help the old lady that everyone turned against last season.

The interview goes well, Jimmy respects conventions. They ask him questions, he answers them as best as possible. He dodges a difficult question about the reason why he's not a lawyer anymore, but he doesn't lie. He's mostly honest about his shortcomings, that he's no salesman. The interview is over, and Jimmy knows his chances aren't great. The interviewers did not look terribly convinced.

###III. The Saul approach

Jimmy reflects on that on his way out, his quick thinking in full motion. How can he solve this? How can he turn this situation that is almost lost into a good one? He goes back in, and turns the Saul mode on. He's not respecting conventions anymore, and preach an auditory. He's not interested in their questions, he leads the narrative. He seduces them with words he knows to be empty. He is Slipping Jimmy in that moment, he's not James McGuill the lawyer. And just like that, it works. Instantly. He did not have to work on it, he just unleashed the horses and what he got what he wanted.

###IV. The rejection

This realization disgusts him. He does not want to be Slipping Jimmy; this is the reason why he entered a serious job in the mail room, this is the reason why he worked his ass off to become a lawyer while working a full-time job. This is the reason why he kept trying to have a serious and honest practice of law. He wants to be respectable. He hates Slipping Jimmy; notably because his older brother does. His actions are to please his brother, even after his death. And in that moment, during that job interview more than ever, he sees how much more effective is the Saul/Slipping approach is. He's often been able to see that it was an effective approach, but rarely has he compared the two approaches so directly and closely.

He gets angry at them for falling for this; because he wants this approach to be ineffective. He wants a world where people would see through that shit and where he would be *forced* to be good. Where he would never have the temptation to be Slipping Jimmy to reach his goals. He blames them for falling so easily to what is essentially a con-artist: they should background check him, verify that he's actually who he is, but they don't, and that proves to him that Slipping/Saul will always be the most efficient way.

###V. The figurine

I saw many people commenting that during the job interview scene was about the figurine worth $8k, and that this was why Jimmy turned down the job. Now let's look a bit further on the money angle: why would Jimmy come back in the office if his goal was to steal that figurine? What does he gain there? Nothing at all. The figurine is nothing short of a red herring; yes, it shows a bit more of the Slipping Jimmy side, but that's not the center of this scene. 

The year is 2046, Dustin Bowder II is now game director of Champions of the Tempest (the HotS had to be sold to Blizzard South after the great schism in 2035, that saw the game company split in two after a big fight over wether or not Hearthstone should finally nerf Shamans, some saying they should wait for more data, others saying 20 years were enough).

Dustin II enters the office and salutes his father's full size statue sitting on a rock. Old Alan greets him, asks him if he's ready for the 2.0, Dustin smiles at the old man, shakes his head a bit, feeling sorry for his old mentor gone crazy while trying to find a way to fit Deathwing in the game. He quickly passes by the map designing team, that seeks to have his feedback on the latest map: a 7 lanes map happening on three different levels, Hell, Sanctuary and Heaven, where you have to replay the last Diablo game to date's campaign, where players ended up killing Malthael, to capture an objective that allows you to battle the enemy team in a 3D chess best of three contest. Dustin scratches his head, asks them if this isn't a tad too complex, but one of the designers quickly reassures him, after the Rubix Cube map where players had to rearrange the famous cube by killing creeps on a lane to rotate it, players should feel ready for this one.

Dustin finally reaches his desk. He sits down, breathes a bit before starting to work and looks through his office's window: the Overwatch theme park built next to Blizzard West's HQ is doing well. Doomfist's arrival in Overwatch last year helped the park going through the difficult past decades, after its creation back in 2018. Dustin logs in and replies to his emails. Khaldor's retirement home has agreed to drive him to the HQ for the CotT 11.0 event, ""great news"" thinks Dustin II, smiling at the thought of his favorite caster so bald now that his hair has grown reverse to become a full lenght mane. The development team sends their final draft for Terokk, with the Q&A team in copy, apparently the internal tests were great, with one of his ultimate found to be winning 30% less than the other, which will help players prove themselves that they can choose correctly. He then takes a bit of a break, and goes to browse reddit. He finds a thread on the CotT sub asking when will the API for stats be released, laughs and posts ""soon"", and out of curiosity goes to check that HotSlogs website to see by himself what's the big deal. Fifteen seconds later, his computer is on fire and Dustin II has to trigger the fire alarm.

The team gathers and calmly evacuates the building. On his way out, he sees his father in his wheelchair now, pushed by old Alan. He waves at him, and talks to him a little. How are things, he asks, pretty good son, his father answers. I've been assigned to an unannounced project, he says with a spark of excitement in his eye. Dustin II smiles at his dad, a bitter sweet smile, for he knows that this is where old Blizzard employee are sent, the ""unannounced projects"" as they say with air quotation marks. They give them development tools and let them create stuff to make them feel important; they even almost created something for real once, they called it ""Titan"". He gestures Alan to let him push his father a little further and he tries to appreciate the calm scenery between OverPark and the cries from the Pharrah Sky Jump and the building now burning down behind them. 

In a moment of clarity, Dustin senior puts his hand on his son's and looks him in the eyes. Son, he says, I know we're not really doing anything down there on that project, you know. But you're my pride, I know you've taken the mantle, and that you're doing his best. Dustin junior hugs his father's hand, don't talk like that he says, and after all, you've shown us the way, he adds. His father seems happy for a moment, and closes his eyes. But he reopens then quickly, as if suddenly remembering something. Tell me something, junior, he starts, tell me you've released him. Junior tries to look away, but his father is now squeezing his hand. Tell me you did ! But Dustin II refuses to answer, he looks away, searching for an answer in the distant landscape. No, he whispers, to his father's now gaping in horror's mouth. No, father, Kel'Thuzad is still not ready."

hamburgular70,3,2,"I always add a bit of dijon to help emulsify my vinaigrette, which is probably in most recipes. I got the tip from Kenji's minute mayonnaise originally, but it works great when mixing a quick dressing with a whisk. Keeps it from just being plain oil in some spots and straight vinegar in others, and it doesn't really affect the flavor unless you want it to.The key is that you can whip up a delicious meal from hundreds of online specialized instant pot recipes in less than an hour. I'm married with a toddler and my wife and I work full time. I get home at 5:00 if I'm lucky and need to be eating by 6:00. The instant pot helps get that done and drastically increases my options of I haven't prepped at all.

For example, I can put together beef stew and have it on the table in 45 minutes. Soups, braised chicken, dry beans, or about any slow cooker meal done in less than an hour. It's also not very active cooking, so I can start something in it and go on about my business for half an hour while it cooks. This is invaluable. 

I thought of this after seeing the Instant Pot Duo 60 7 in 1 for $80 today at Walmart (while there to get sweet vintage Godzilla action figures), which is $20 less than I spent on it. Parents, newlyweds, college students, and adults of any sort can use them to add variety, save time, and save money by eating out less with these. If you're considering buying a slow cooker, take another look at the instant pot instead.

mulder_scully,2,1,"I picked up the game last Monday on a whim at Gamestop after reading a few recommendations around here and /r/PS4. I played the first 30 minutes and could NOT get past the first level. I have never played a game this difficult or a game like Dark Souls, but the word-building and battle system was so robust that I invested several hours until I came across the Cleric Beast.

My boyfriend's only experience with gaming is Diablo III and Mario, but he watched me play and texted me the following day while I was at work: ""So I've been playing Bloodborne for 6 hours and created a female character.""

I've literally woken up at 1am and found him out in the living room secretly playing the game and HOLY SHIT is he fucking good at it now. He just finished the nightmare mensis and is constantly reading about it on forums and talking with me. He's had a long battle with depression, uninterested in pretty much any game and sullen. He LOVES this game because it challenges him to think about each level and plan out a strategy. His counselor could not believe the positive mental growth he has experienced since starting the game and has actually called up other counselors in the area to ask how certain video games actually aided people in depression.

There is something to say about Bloodborne that goes beyond the normal experience of video game interaction. The challenge of this game has almost activated a renewal in my partners insistence to complete a task. It's reached outside of Bloodborne too. Just this weekend he started cooking a few elaborate meals he has been wanting to make for months, he is reading books that he bought. His entire emotional state seems to have subtly improved. I seriously couldn't be happier.

He's close to the end of the game (I think) and said he just ordered Dark Souls off Amazon so he has something to do when he is finished with Bloodborne. :)They taught me how to lie by omission. Theocratic warfare.

They taught me women's voices don't matter and they should be silent.

I watched as my dad told my mom to shut up during family dinner.

They taught me sexual repression; that sex is inherently bad.

They taught me to be ashamed of thinking.

They taught me to immediately disbelieve science.

They taught me the art of deception, conniving, and manipulation.

I can swindle anyone.

They told me exercising is for ungodly people.

They said the fossils on mountains are from a great flood, not tectonic activity.

They taught me the art of hiding and maneuvering. 

They said I could be anyone, do anything, create infinitely, but only in paradise.

They taught me to reach for the stars, but not now, only later.

They taught me that depression is fake.

Therapy is bad.

They said the end is coming, soon, well not as soon as we thought.

Then 1914 passed.

Then 1919 passed

Then 1925 passed.

Then 1975 passed.

Then I graduated high school.

It was supposed to happen before that, I was told.

That was 10 years ago.

They taught me to pray for death,

Global annihilation is welcomed.

We should pray for 8 billion people to die.

That we are special because of it.

That somehow all of this is a hidden truth.

And not a weapon of silence and control."
