[Wiki and Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/wiki/index)

#Submission Guidelines

* Submissions need to cite at least one peer-reviewed study. We understand that not all of our members are involved in academia, but submissions should primarily come from journal articles and sourced and long-form articles.

* If your submission is a video that references peer-reviewed research, please comment in the thread with links to the research. Video submissions without such a comment will be removed.

* All link posts should have titles that clearly tell the reader what the content is. All posts with clickbait titles, titles that explain nothing about what is in the link, severely editorialized titles, or titles that attempt to promote an agenda will be removed.

* Images, GIFs, jokes, and content discussing philosophy, religion, and pseudoscience (except when in the context of a study) are not appropriate and will be removed.

* Links to self-help, blogspam, “guru” websites, or other unsourced material are not appropriate and will be removed.

* We encourage users to make an initial comment in their submission thread.  Perhaps why you found the content interesting or troubling, a critique of a study's methods, etc.

* Please do not post links to your own surveys.  If you require participants for a survey, try /r/samplesize or our [survey thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/3dw9q7/psychological_surveysresearch_thread/).

- If you would like to talk about careers in psychology, try /r/academicpsychology

- If you need advice, try /r/advice

* Comments (especially top-level) consisting solely of anecdotes, jokes, memes, or otherwise off-topic remarks will be removed.  Your comment is likely to be removed if it's evident you have not read the submission.

* We welcome opposing views and perspectives, but comments meant to intentionally deride, mock, or cause harm will be removed.

* No dismissive or anti-science comments. Comments mocking or belittling the field will be removed.  If you are concerned about a study's methodology, please elaborate as to why, and not just leave ""This is common sense!"" or ""Well, duh!"" posts.

----

If your post conforms to the submission guidelines and was still removed, please link to the post in question and why you think we should re-approve the submission.

## Tips:

- These are not the subreddit rules. Please see the Full Subreddit Rules in the link above.

- If you are posting a help request, please include as many details as possible. Please consider adding photos and doing some basic research into your question. /r/DIY should not be your first stop for your question.  

- All help request must go in ""self posts"" or the stickied thread at the top of the subreddit.

- If you are sharing your finished DIY project, please explain how it was done. Consider putting the finished photo first, however this is not a requirement. Comments regarding finished photo location will be removed. Projects without adequate detail will be removed.

- Please keep all comments on topic. Moderators will remove off-topic comments at their discretion.  

- All images must be hosted on imgur. Non-imgur links will be considered on a case by case basis. Please message the moderators with a link to your post for approval.

- Civility is a requirement for participating on /r/DIY. We try to stick to a ""3-strike"" policy for rule infractions - however moderators reserve the right to bypass this policy any time. A temporary ban constitutes a ""strike"".



---

> ###Important note:
>
> Finished DIY project submissions without adequate details / photos will be removed. Consider submitting these photos to /r/somethingimade instead. /r/DIY is about the process rather than the result.
>
> A good rule of thumb is somebody who sees your post should be able to relatively get close to being able to replicate the project with the information you've provided

###### Please read the [Sub Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines) before posting."
Justrolledintotheshop,8,"For those absolutely stupid things that you see people bring, roll, or toss into your place of business and the people that bring them in.

Read before posting!
===============

1. Submissions must be something you saw that was odd and out of the ordinary for your work setting. Only original content is acceptable. Do not post pictures taken by others.  Automotive and Non-automotive mechanical failure/oddities ONLY. Examples of this include computers, HVAC, aircraft, helicopters, etc. Animals do not fall under the guidelines of Rule #1.

2. Posts need not be automotive related, but must follow rule 1.

3. This is not a place to ask for help troubleshooting your vehicles issues. You can instead post these to our sister subreddit: /r/MechanicAdvice. Posts of this nature will be removed.

4. If it's not obvious, please include a detailed description of what the problem is or what the thing in the picture does/is supposed to do.

5. No memes or rage comics. 

6. Do not link photos from Facebook.  If you have a photo from FB you want to post, upload it into [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) then post from there.  Linking from FB causes security issues for the persons profile.

7. Please mark pictures with blood/gore/sexually natured as NSFW.

8. Please cover or remove license plate numbers, VINs, phone numbers, and names.

9. Do not post a ""spotted picture"" /r/Spotted,  /r/JRITSlounge, or /r/SeenOnTheStreet  are the proper places for those posts. Any offending posts will be deleted, this rule will be enforced with extreme prejudice. 

10. Discussions and questions that promote discussion are allowed, but questions cannot be of an /r/MechanicAdvice nature.  For example, ""What is the worst customer experience you've had?"" is allowed while ""What's wrong with my car?"" is not.  

11. Absolutely no sale site posts.  This includes Craigslist, Ebay, Facebook sale groups, etc.  For more explanation, see rule 1. 

12. Trend posts or ""karma trains"" will be regulated at the discretion of the moderators, as they often lead to rule breaking when they get out of hand. 

--> If you do not see your submitted post in ""new"" within 5 minutes, message the mods with the URL to your submission and we can fish it out of the spam filter for you.

[Full rules](/r/3DS/wiki/rules) [Wiki](/r/3DS/wiki/index)

**\/r/3DS Rules:**

- Keep things civil and on-topic.
*Threads should be directly related to the 3DS and its accessories. Comments should be on-topic with the thread in which it is posted. All posts should be civil and follow Reddiquette.*

- No basic questions or those covered in the wiki.
*Questions which can be quickly answered via a Google search or those which have been addressed in the wiki must be directed to the Weekly Question Thread. This includes game recommendations and tech support topics.*

- Threads must follow content guidelines.
*No NSFW content, low-effort posts, vague or misleading titles, reposts, image only, or friend code / request posts.*

- No spoilers in post titles.
*Posts with spoilers in the title will be removed. If your comment contains a spoiler, hide it using:* `>!`This is a spoiler.`!<`

- Do not LINK to pirated, hacked, or otherwise illegal content.
*Discussion of homebrew and flash carts are allowed.*

- No trading, selling, buying, or begging.
*This includes links to third party selling sites.*

- No excessive self-promotion; No affiliate links.
*Self-promotion must be within 10% of all threads and comments reddit-wide, read [Reddit's Self-Promotion guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) for more information. No affiliate links of any kind, ever.*

- Link to original source.
*News, speculation, rumors, etc must always link to the original source of the information. No blogspam or similar.*

- NO REPOSTS
*This should go without saying, but check the front page and use the search feature to see if something has already been posted before submitting.*

- No Piracy
*No piracy, including linking piracy resources, naming piracy resources or tools, promotion of or admission of piracy, requesting support for pirated content, etc. Piracy, for clearer definition, is the production and/or distribution of new copies of a copyrighted work without the authorization of the copyright owner regardless of price, including demos/updates. Out of print does not mean copyright is expired. Piracy is toxic to communities and legal reform efforts.*

**How do I post spoilers?**


- Use this code for comments:
`>!`Mario saves Peach.`!<`  

- Spoiler tagging DOESN'T WORK in post titles. Use the tag [SPOILER] in the beginning of your title and give a general description of its contents. Do not include any spoilers in a post title.

##Rules:

1.  **Mods = Gods**  
Do NOT break any rules that the mods might invent on the spot.  

2. **4chan Only**  
Do NOT post anything unrelated to 4chan. Do NOT link directly to 4chan.org. Do NOT post anything from unrelated websites. Screencaps from 4chan are ideal.  

3. **New Content Only**  
Do NOT post screencaps over a year old, do NOT repost, and do NOT omit the date and time stamp. Those posts belong in /r/classic4chan (RIP).

4. **High Quality Only**  
This applies to quality content and quality presentation. Crop your post so it's actually legible. Don't post garbage that isn't entertaining.  

5. **No Redditry**  
Do NOT act like a basic reddit bitch. This includes cliche reddit phrases, subreddit mentions, puns, song lyrics, novelty accounts, getting lots of karma on a single post, sperging out at someone like a 13 year old on Xbox, and other dummy things that make you a manchild.  
E.g. not my proudest fap, /r/theydidthemath, I did nazi that coming, cake day, Fake and Gay, /u/[somethingstupid], 1000 upvotes, etc.  

6. **No Doxxing**  
Do NOT reveal personal information, or post 4chan screenshots that contain personal information of any individual. Do not post 4chan screenshots of Reddit account names or calls for raids. Remember, NYPA.  

7. **No CP**  
Do not post nude images of underage children, or say that nude images of underage children aren't child pornography, or say that nude images of underage children are okay, or describe images of underage children in text form.  
If we see you do this anywhere on Reddit, we will report you to the law enforcement agency of where you live.

8. **NSFW marking**  
Do NOT forget to mark NSFW content. The overall subreddit is SFW, so people need to really know when a submission is legit NSFW. (Potty Words are not NSFW).  

9. **No Grooming**  
No agendaposting.

10. **Admin abuse**  
The admins bypassed the mods and directly took action on the subreddit.

## Mods Statement:

----

We personally severely dislike reddit and everyone who frequents it. We believe it's a shitty, destructive echo chamber that does public harm as an internet publisher. We think this website discourages real interpersonal communication, and encourages addict-like consumption."

oddlysatisfying,9,"###Welcome to /r/oddlysatisfying!
Here you can post things that make you feel, well, oddly satisfied. This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).
####What does ""Oddly Satisfying"" mean?
We are forever searching for a ""true definition"". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* ""oddly satisfying"" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.

***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**

######Rules:
**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**
###1)  **Banned Topics:**
We have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:

* **Memes or image macros**

* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as ""2048"", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.

* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.

* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).

* **Compilation Albums/Videos**
  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**
  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).
  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.

* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.

* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. 

###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** 
NSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (""Say it, don't show it.""). 

###3)  **Reposts:** 
**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.


###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** 
Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.

###5)  **Submission Titles:**

* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.

* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.

* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as ""My..."", ""Mine..."", ""Our..."", ""We..."", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.

###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** 
Please cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.

* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**
* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)

###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**

* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: 
  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing & ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.

###8) **Reddiquette, Comments & Subreddit Behavior:**

* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.
* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.
* The definition of what truly is ""Oddly Satisfying"" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.

###9) **Crossposts**
* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma.

|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with ""When you…"" or ""When they…"" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, ""challenges,"" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.
|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|
|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|
|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|

ChoosingBeggars,3,"[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)

This subreddit is for posting screenshots, pictures, or stories of people who are being **way** too picky when it comes to who they beg for a relationship or any other matter.

**Rules:**

 1. Blur out identifying info (Age, Name(s), Location, etc). This includes OP's info.

 1. Please use [Imgur](http://imgur.com) or Reddit for image hosting.

 1. Please be nice to other users.

 1. Don't link to other sub-reddits (You will be banned)

 1. Don't incite others to visit the page a given post pertains to. Additionally, refrain from enquiring OP for the underlying source(s).

 If you ever notice brigading, please report and message the moderators

 1.  Person must be a beggar, such as: 
* **Person seeking goods or services at a reduced cost, for free, or for a laughably lopsided trade**
* **Person using social media, dating apps, or otherwise to seek out a specific type of relationship**


 1.  Person must be choosy, as in:
* **Person must have unreasonable standards or have a comical sense of entitlement**
 1. No reposts from top 100, front page or last 12 months.

 1. **Moderators may use discretion to upkeep the quality of the subreddit. Obviously fake or otherwise unsuitable content may be removed.**

 1. Please make an effort with your title. ""Found on Facebook"", ""This belongs here"", ""Saw this on snapchat"", ""🍆💦"" etc are hard to find later, give at least a little bit for us to go on, thanks.


#Here is what is NOT a ChoosingBeggar:

***
**Unattractive people seeking a normal relationship and having reasonable standards is not a good fit for this sub. Ugly people are allowed to want a partner with a job, or no kids, or anything else we would consider reasonable for the beautiful people.**

***
**A person asking for help with life's necessities out of desperation is not a choosingbeggar** 

* If someone ran out of money and needs gas money to get to work and the only thing they can think of is to make a status update on Facebook asking if anyone can spare them some money, they aren't really being choosy. They got the beggar part down, but this sub is not /r/beggars so that post wouldn't fit. If that same person turns down someone offering to give them a ride to work because they don't want to be seen in a PT Cruiser, then that post would fit.

*  A parent asking for handouts because their kids want an Xbox  for Christmas and the only way that could happen is if someone donates one, that isn't a choosingbeggar. That's someone begging, but without a sense of entitlement. If that person is offered a Nintendo and they scoff at the suggestion, then that would be a good post.

**The person begging must be at least in the gradient of being an entitled jerk, this sub is not a place to mock poverty**

#CONTENT POLICY

This subreddit is **moderated for quality**, which means we remove content that we deem to be low quality, low effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. **We do not ""let the votes decide""**. We understand that this type of policy is controversial and uncommon, especially for default subreddits, but we believe this method of moderation gives a subreddit the best chance at maintaining quality.

#[THE RULES](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/wiki/rules)

Rules are enforced upon moderator discretion. 

---

## 1: **IT MUST BE CRAPPY DESIGN**

Every submission must be a bad design, otherwise it may be removed. Any design mentioned in this list of [things that are not crappy design](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/wiki/not_crappy_design) is not allowed. Other low-quality posts may be removed at moderator discretion.

## 2: **NO COMMON REPOSTS**

New content is encouraged. Reposts of content in the [common reposts list](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/wiki/common_reposts), in the [top 150 posts of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/top/?sort=top&t=all) or under three months old are not allowed. Other reposts may be removed at moderator discretion.

## 3: **NO SOFTWARE DESIGNS**

Any kind of software design, intentional or not, is not allowed. This includes (but is not limited to): websites, emails, search results, videogames, etc. r/SoftwareGore or r/TechNope might be better places for these posts.

## 4: **NO HATE SYMBOLS**

This includes (but is not limited to): things that look like swastikas, ""KKK"" acronyms, Nazi salutes, racism, political hate, etc.

r/AccidentalSwastika, r/Oopzi, and r/AccidentalRacism might be better places for these posts.

## 5: **NO SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE POSTS**

This includes (but is not limited to): things or words that look like penises, vaginas, scrotums, boobs, butt-plugs, dildos, etc.

r/MildlyPenis, r/MildlyVagina, r/MildlyBoobs, and r/MildlyButthole might be better places for these posts.

## 6: **TITLES SHOULD DESCRIBE AND REPRESENT THE CONTENT**

If the crappy design is not obvious in the photo, please describe it in the title. Low effort titles, sarcasm, StRaNgE CaPiTaLiZaTiOnS, and excessive emojis may be removed at moderator discretion.

## 7: **NO MEMES OR IMAGE MACROS**

The crappy design should be obvious from the photo or the title. Memes or [image macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro) are not necessary to describe it.

## 8: **BE CIVIL AND NO PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, inappropriate behavior and comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed.

Posts or comments containing or seeking any identifying personal information (real or fake) will also be removed. This includes (but is not limited to): names, phone numbers, email addresses, and social media accounts, regardless if it is your own.

Violators may be banned without prior warning for breaking any of these rules.

answers,2,"Everything you ever wanted to know about anything but were afraid to ask. Especially things someone else might Google for some day. Questions must have fact based answers.

Please note that ""/r/AskReddit"" style posts, troll/shit posts, or other extremely inappropriate posts will be removed.

Go ahead and ask your questions, reddit!

**ALL comments must be helpful and related to the topic at hand.**

**If you see such posts or comments that violates the rules, please report them.**

----

**Rules**:

* **No unhelpful, off-topic, or joke answers or questions.**

>All comments must be helpful and relevant.   
**Joke answers and questions are not allowed.**     
Questions are ok; memes are not!

* **No survey questions**

* **No trolling. No shitposts.**

> Baiting people, passive aggressive posts etc. are not allowed.

* **Don't be a jerk**

>Being a jerk is not allowed in this subreddit. Hostility, passive aggressiveness and using racial slurs are included.

* **No advice questions**

>These questions will be better suited for /r/Advice or /r/relationship_advice.

* **No medical questions**

>The users of r/answers aren't guaranteed to be qualified medical professionals, and if you're facing a medical issue, relying on the advice of random strangers is potentially dangerous. In the worst case, you could be convinced that a real issue isn't something to worry about.

>The best responses to medical questions have always been to actually see a doctor, so we're explicitly banning these types of questions. This includes mental health questions.

>Try r/AskDocs or r/DiagnoseMe.
 
* **No loaded questions or answers, and no rants**

>r/answers is not the place to rant about a topic you've already made your mind up on, or to ask questions that, in themselves, could influence the community to agree with your answer. These types of questions are subject to removal. This also applies to loaded *answers*.

* **Impossible question**

>Questions which are impossible to know the answer to are not allowed in r/answers.

* **Questions must have a definitive answer**

>r/answers is for reference questions with definitive answers. If your question doesn't have a definitive answer, or people might disagree on the ""correct"" answer, it's not a good fit for r/answers.

* **Politics questions**

>Political questions without a definitive answer often devolve into partisan mudslinging. This type of digression is unsuitable for r/answers. Visit r/AskPolitics or r/PoliticalDiscussion to have these types of conversations.

#Rules

|||
|:--|:--|
1. Don't link directly to posts. Redact all identifying information. | Take a screenshot and redact all identifying information, e.g. real names, usernames (including your own), addresses, license plates. DO NOT ASK FOR NAMES/USERNAMES.
2. Memes and image macros are not allowed. | Don't post memes, copypastas, or image macros (broadly defined as an image with text on it). This includes, but is not limited to, Snap Stories, Whisper, and ""background color"" Facebook statuses. **Posts that include someone pinging the name of this sub will be removed.** The only exception to this rule is if the focus of the post is a comment someone made about the meme.
3. Submissions of obvious trolls or jokes are not allowed. | Use common sense. 
4. Stuff that looks verysmart but isn't really. | This submission isn't really an example of some one trying to be “verysmart.” Common examples of things that look verysmart but aren’t really include: conspiracy theories, New Age woo, drug-induced posts, most of Trump's tweets, ""sheeple,"" Neil deGrasse Tyson, Rick and Morty, etc.
5. Long posts: Highlight relevant parts. | Highlight relevant sections, or cut it down into an album. With videos, put excerpts in the comments.
6. No reposts. | Use the search function.
7. Make an effort with your title. | Titles should be at the very least descriptive of what is in the post, and ideally funny and/or interesting. Titles consisting of nothing more than ""Thought this belongs here"" or ""Found on [website]"" will be removed.
8. Submissions involving arguments are not allowed. | Posts cannot be part of an argument. This is to prevent people from using this subreddit to mock those they're debating with. We're looking for examples of people acting ""verysmart"" on their own without being baited into it. This rule applies whether you're involved in the argument or not.
9. Avoid anti-intellectualism | Don't post people explaining concepts, even in a way that seems pedantic. Having expertise in a subject or enjoying intellectual pursuits don't make someone ""verysmart."" This sub does not discourage learning or critical thinking."

☑️
RULES

1.) **Do not post content just because a black person posted it.** This sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious and insightful social media posts made by black people, not just any social media post made by black people.

-    1. **No original content.** We encourage users to go on twitter to find tweets as opposed to making tweets just  for     this subreddit.
  


2.) No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp).
 
3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. 
 
4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.
 
5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).

6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.

7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.

8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add ""bruh"", ""fam"", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.

9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking ""what does x mean?"" will be removed. 


10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.
 
11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  

12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**

Survival,10,"****

**WELCOME TO R/SURVIVAL**

The Wilderness Survival subreddit

****

**Disclaimer:**

r/survival is a forum for sharing and discussion of the topic of wilderness survival and not an authoritative source of information. Your training, preparedness, health, well-being and safety *are your own responsibility!*

The subscribers, commentators and moderators of r/survival are not responsible in any way for how this information is used nor for any actions based on it that may result in damage to property, injury, sickness or death, accidental or otherwise.

****

**What is *Wilderness Survival*?**

r/survival defines *Wilderness Survival* as the philosophies, knowledge, techniques, and actions applied in a Wilderness environment, in a short-term survival scenario, which serve to increase the likelihood of survival of the individual or group.

****

**Rules of r/survival:**

* Follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Be nice. 

* Keep all posts on the topic of *Wilderness Survival* (see definition above). This means no posts about urban survival, bug out, prepping, teotwawki, zombies, collapse, etc.

* Please use the [search feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/search) before posting. Chances are someone has posted about that topic before.

* No ""check out my gear"" posts. Posts about gear must contain specific questions, comments, reviews, modifications, or ingenious new uses. Requests for review of kits are accepted but please don't turn this sub into /r/survivalgearporn.

* No blog spam or blatant advertising-only posts. Please see reddit's [self-promotion rules](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) for clarification of what constitutes blog spam.

* All posts regarding medical topics (first aid kits, medical advice, etc) must have OPs level of medical certification in the post title (abbreviated e.g MD, RN, EMT, etc.) or in the body of the submission. If you aren't certified that's fine, just indicate so in your post. This rule is to ensure OP isn't given advice outside their safe scope of practice. 

* Please do not post dangerous advice. Any comments and advice posted that can have a potential lethal and/or harmful outcome can and will be deleted by the mods with no notice required. 

Failure to adhere to these rules will result in a removal of the offending post. Repeat offenders may find themselves banned from r/survival.

****

Regarding First Aid/Medicine posts: Medical advice from strangers on the internet is **not** an authoritative source of information nor does it establish or even imply a patient/caregiver relationship. **Please consult with a licensed physician or otherwise qualified healthcare provider if you require medical advice or treatment.**The subscribers, moderators and commentators of this subreddit are not responsible for any medical advice and the consequences from following it, posted herein. **Please make sure to read the disclaimer.**

#Content Philosophy:
Content which benefits the community (news, rumors, and discussions) is generally allowed and is valued
over content which benefits only the individual (technical questions, help
buying/selling, rants, self-promotion, etc.) which will be removed if it's in violation of the rules.

---
#Rules:
####Hover for more info
###1. Only submissions that are directly related to Android are allowed.
- All posts to r/Android must be related to the Android OS or ecosystem in some way. If not obvious, you should submit the link as a self-post and include an explanation. Comments that devolve into purely political discussions may be locked and people in violation may get banned if they are also violating Rule 9.

###2. We welcome **discussion-promoting** posts that benefit the community, and not the individual.
- We welcome posts that benefit the community (device reviews, guides, discussions and rumors) and not the individual (seeking help, e.g. tech support, purchase advice, app recommendations). You might be interested in r/AndroidQuestions, r/PickAnAndroidForMe or r/AndroidApps instead.
- If you're asking a question, include your own analysis first in a few sentences. Discussion-promoting rants are okay at mods' discretion.

###3. Images/videos must be in **self posts**.
- Please provide an explanation in the self-post body. No memes.
- YouTube videos are fine as links, provided they don't break other rules.

###4. No self-promotional spamming
- Developers may post their own apps if they follow these conditions:
- 1- Their post must be a self post with a detailed description of their app.
- 2- The developer's account must be at least three months old AND have a reasonable posting history on r/Android.
- 3- The developer must interact with users in the thread. We do not allow developers to simply dump a link to their app and leave.
- Website/blog/YouTube channel owners are generally not allowed to post their own content; please see [this page](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

###5. No reposts or blog-spam/rehosted content
- Submit the original source whenever possible, unless it's not in English or the article adds substantial information.
- Reposts are not allowed. This includes an article whose information has already been covered by another article posted on r/Android.

###6. No editorializing titles.
- Please do not change the link's title when submitting it, unless necessary to accurately sum up the article. You may freely add ""[Author]"" or ""by Author"" if it clarifies the article's source (e.g. YouTube video).
- If you want to discuss something specific, use the comments or submit it as a self-post (see rule 2).

###7. No piracy.
- Do not link or discuss pirated apps/piracy websites.

###8. No **unauthorized** polls, surveys, bots, or giveaways.
- To prevent scams, we require that all polls or giveaways be approved by the moderators. [Modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAndroid) with your request before you post any poll or do any giveaway. 
- Only pre-approved bots are allowed on /r/Android. Currently, the only bot we allow to be invoked is the LinkMe_Bot. This bot can be summoned by commenting ""Linkme: APPNAMEHERE."" without quotes. If you wish to use your bot on this sub, then [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAndroid) and show us that it can serve a useful purpose here.

###9. No offensive, hateful, or low-effort comments.  
- Do not be rude to any other user. Be respectful, adhere to [redditquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), or you may be banned.
- Do not use hate speech of any kind.
- Do not be disrespectful towards another for their personal choices (excessive fanboyism).
- Do not accuse others of being ""paid shills.""
- Do not post low-effort/circlejerky comments.

###10. No affiliate links.
- If you are a Redditor, affiliate links are absolutely NOT allowed in either the comments section, within the self-text of your post, or as part of your link.
- If you post an article, affiliate links will NOT be allowed if the article being linked is a simple ""deal alert"" type post. Instead, simply link directly to the deal (without the affiliate link included).

#3. Self promotion, referral links & spam

Users posting YT & Twitch links must have 20 link karma & 20 comment karma and must be compliant with the sub’s rules.

## Rules
* **1. Keep the discussion related to Windows 10**
Posts completely unrelated to Windows 10 will be removed. Just because something is compatible with Windows, doesn't mean this is the subreddit for it. Derailing conversations and threads is not allowed.

* **2. Flair posts correctly**
We are not extremely strict with what flair you pick, but if it's very wrong we will change it. If we select another flair, don't put the original one back. Not sure what flair to use?

* **3. Do not distribute malicious programs**

* **4. Do not post Blogspam links or URL shorteners**
Blogspam, URL shorteners, mobile links, and referral and affiliate links are not allowed. Post the full desktop link for articles and news.

* **5. Be civil and do not troll others**
Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, inappropriate behavior and comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users are not allowed. Posts or comments containing or seeking any identifying personal information are also prohibited. Do not engage in blatant trolling or flaming.

* **6. Do not advertise a 3^rd party software without permission**
If you want to promote your app or website, you must [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Windows10) to request permission. Include as much relevant information as you can in both the modmail and the post. This is not a marketplace subreddit, selling anything is prohibited.

* **7. Do not promote pirated content or grey market keys**
Do not post pirated content or promote it in any way. Encouraging or hinting at the use of sellers of grey market keys is not allowed.

* **8. Titles must be relevant to the post**
Irrelevant, sensationalized, or vague titles that have the pure intent of misleading or dramatizing a topic are not allowed. The relevancy of submissions' titles will be judged at the moderator's discretion.

* **9. Do not submit reposts or low-effort posts**
Reposts are not allowed. All posts and answers that can easily be found by searching this subreddit or by using a search engine will be removed at the moderator's discretion.

* **10. Only post memes and tech support posts on Mondays**
Memes and tech support posts are only allowed on Mondays (UTC timezone) and they will be removed any other day of the week. Not Monday yet?

([Clarification on Zero Tolerence Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/344z1c/psa_we_have_a_zero_tolerance_policy_on_personal/))  **Treat people, *including the devs,* with respect.** Disrespectful behavior may result in a account suspensions or permanent bans from the subreddit depending on the severity and past behavior.  Rude behavior during an AMA will result in a permanent ban from the subreddit.

- Trading is allowed here and encouraged.  Please be clear what you're posting, what platform you're trading from, and if possible what you're seeking to trade for.  Note: Any RMT (Real Money Transactions) or cross game/platform trades are a violation of the ToS, and will result in a ban from this subreddit, as would trading accounts regardless game and/or platform.  Trade posts requesting AD will also be removed.  Use the AH for that.  Begging (or requesting free items) is prohibited.

- Due to talk and accusations of exploitation, we will no longer be allowing any screenshots or edited video of speedruns. If you wish to post video of a speedrun, it must be a full uncut video. We apologize for any inconvenience this may be to anyone.

- Do not post any (de)motivationals, etc.  Memes are **allowed**, provided that they do not violate any other subreddit or Reddit rules.  Loot screenshots are allowed as long as they don't clog up the subreddit.

- No advertising for other MMOs.  For other MMO discussions, check out /r/mmorpg.

- When posting codes for giveaway, please avoid posting the code in plain text, as this allows bots to claim them.  Either post a image (only marginally better, bots can still claim them, but not as easily), or remove a couple digits and have people fill in the blanks by asking math questions or something similar.

#####**Reddiquette Reminder:**

- Title on posts should be descriptive, constructive and accurate. Do not editorialize or sensationalize your submission title. ""Click-bait"" style titles or posts with titles that break these rules in any other way will be removed.

- Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it (downvoting is not an ""I disagree"" button).

#[**Rules for Submissions**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules)

I. **Titles**

1. All titles must begin with [PsBattle:](/submit/?title=PsBattle:%20)

    This *is* case sensitive and must include a space after the colon.

2. Titles must *objectively describe* the subject of the image.

    2.1. No jokes, editorialising, or giving background info. The quality of the image is more important than how catchy the title is. 

    2.2. Requests, such as ""Please photoshop me or my friend"", are not permitted. Please review our suggestions below for an appropriate subreddit.

    2.3. Questions, such as ""Where else could he be?"" are not permitted.

    2.4. No personal anecdotes or mention of your connection to the image.

    2.5. No clichés such as ""this has potential"", ""make this epic"", ""This cat/dog/baby"", or ""My friend/daughter/son..."".  

II. **Image content**

1. Submissions must be a *direct* link to a *single* image. Albums and paneled/tiled images will be removed.

2. Images must be reasonable quality.

    2.1. Images must be at least 600x600 pixels (360,000 pixels total).
 
    2.2. No [technically low-quality images.](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules#wiki_reasons_for_these_rules)

    2.3. Images must be relatively well framed, and free from noise, blur, and distortion.

3. No disallowed image content.

    3.1. No photos of tv screens / computer monitors / physical pictures / billboards / magazines, etc.

    3.2. Images centered around text or signs may be removed.

    3.3. No phone / computer screenshots.

4. Images that have already been photoshopped may be removed, including images with watermarks, logos, or added text.

5. Images that have active threads, or have been photoshopped here, or elsewhere, may be removed.

6. If the mods believe that someone would object to having their image photoshopped or shared (no snapchats), it may be removed.

7. Sexually suggestive and overly gory submissions may be removed. 

**Deleting submissions with work in the comment section is not tolerated, and will result in a permanent submission ban.**

#[**Rules for Commenting**](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/commentingrules)

Junk comments distract from this subreddit a lot more than in other subreddits that are not based on original content. 

Comments that are cliché, karma chains, not an original photoshop, memes, reaction gifs, upvote gifs, or off topic are *subject to removal by the moderators without notification.*

NSFW tags must be used *generously*.

**Top-level comments must contain an original photoshop.**

[*Link to comment rules page.*](/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/commentingrules)

---

**Voting**

Please upvote based on quality of work. **Lazy** shops shouldn't win just because they made you laugh.

Please do not downvote *submissions* just because they do not have obvious potential.

---

Please [report](http://i.imgur.com/DYBtk.png) inappropriate content to the mods.

####Rules:

 - 1: Be polite, friendly and welcoming.

 - 2: Do not tell anyone they are not forever alone enough to be here. Foreveralone has no firm definition but [here is a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_59IpaAENmI9y0cltCe9oFmjWEelHraq69GEfu-gyTY/edit?pli=1#gid=0) that gives an idea of what it's all about.  Forever Alone is not something you achieve, its something you use to describe yourself.

 - 3: Do not post inflammatory comments or threads designed to generalize, demean, insult or otherwise degrade an entire group of people (race, gender, sexual orientation, religion etc).

 - 4: This is not an incel sub, any incel references, slang, or inference will be deemed hate speech and met with a ban. No ""suifuel"" threads.

 - 5: Avoid posts that serve only to advertise other blogs, subreddits or external sites as we have no control over these external resources. Any such posts may be removed. 

 - 6: If you see trolling, [report it to the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23ForeverAlone&subject=Trolling).

 - 7: Any posts created to intentionally start drama on any subject will be removed.  (i.e. linking other subreddits, crossposts to other subreddits, publicly calling out other users, etc.) This also includes Meta conversations about the sub or Moderation Policy.

 - 8: Do not post your dick.

 - 9: If you have been muted by the mods during a PM conversation, and then directly PM a mod's personal account, you will be banned immediately.

* You learn something new every day; what did *you* learn today?
 
* Submit interesting and **specific facts** that you just found out (not broad information you looked up, TodayILearned is not [/r/wikipedia](/r/wikipedia)).
 
#Posting rules#
 
1. **Submissions must be verifiable**. *Please link directly to a reliable source that supports every claim in your post title.* **Images alone do not count as valid references.** Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc).
1. **No personal opinions, anecdotes or subjective statements** (e.g ""TIL xyz is a great movie"").

1. **No recent sources.** Any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) with a publication date more recent than two months are not allowed.
 
1. No politics, soapboxing, or agenda based submissions. This includes (but is not limited to) submissions related to: 
   1. Recent political issues and politicians
   1. Social and economic issues (including race/religion/gender)
   1. Environmental issues
   1. Police misconduct
 
1. **No misleading claims**. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.
 
1. *Rephrase your post title if the following are not met:*
   1. Titles **must** begin with ""TIL ...""
   1. Make them **descriptive, concise and specific** (e.g. not ""TIL something interesting about bacon"").
   1. Titles must be able to **stand on their own** without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary.
   1. *""TIL about ..."" and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia, etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word ""about"").*
   1. *""TIL how to ..."" posts belong on* **/r/HowTo.**
   1. *""TIL the definition of a word..."" Word definitions/translations/origins are not appropriate here*

1. No submissions related to the usage, existence or features of specific software/websites (e.g. ""TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22"").

1.  **All NSFW links must be tagged** *(including comments).*
####  *Please see the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index) for more detailed explanations of the rules, as well as additional rules that may not be listed here*

Welcome! /r/MadeMeSmile is a place to share things that made you smile or brightened up your day.  A generally uplifting subreddit.

Rules:
  
1.  Don't be a jerk.  This subreddit is /r/MadeMeSmile, and it's curated as such. We do not tolerate personal attacks, hate speech, harassment, racism, sexism, or other jerk-like behavior (includes gatekeeping posts).  [SEE MORE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/mademesmile/wiki/rule1)

2.  No ragebait posts.  No posts where someone's misfortune makes you smile.  e.g. ""terrorists driving off a cliff"" or ""murderer gets what he deserves"".  This isn't a ragebait sub.

3.  No social media account surnames.  If we can see the last name of a person visible in your screenshot, it'll get removed. (exception is a twitter checkmark)

4.  Posting more than 4 times in a day is considered spam.  Posting 4 times a day 3 days in a row is considered spam.  Don't flood the subreddit please.

AsiansGoneWild,6,"[](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsiansGoneWild/search?q=author%3Aariakhan00&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)

If you are an **18+** Asian female adult Redditor and want to show your own nude self-pictures or videos for those who will really appreciate it, here is where you can do it!

* **By posting here you confirm you are 18 years of age or older and have read the Subreddit Rules before posting.**

* If you have made a post and it is not showing up, please message the mods as it may have been caught in our spam filter. We will approve it as soon as possible if that is the case.

* **[We now require verification before you can be approved to post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsiansGoneWild/comments/nxybsi/major_rule_change_all_posters_will_now_be/)** Please post your 3 picture verification to your profile and then send a link to it to our [mod mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AsiansGoneWild) and we will review it for approval.

* If you have been verified on another similar NSFW subreddit, please send us a link in [mod mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AsiansGoneWild) to your verification post and it will be verified after review. [](/#verified)

* For verification you need to post to your profile a nude/partially-nude 3 picture verification with you holding a handwritten paper sign (with couples, the female must be holding the sign) with your Reddit username, the date, and ""r/AsiansGoneWild"" or ""r/AGW"" on it (and the pics have to be identifiable as you when compared to your regular postings). Once you send us a link to it in [mod mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AsiansGoneWild) and we approve it, you will receive an exclusive **""AGW Verified""** flair for this subbreddit, earning adoration and respect for eons to come. *You must not delete your verification post or you may lose your flair or be requested to post new verification.*[](/#AGW-verified)

**Subreddit Rules**

* **No** promoting and/or mentions of selling/money/gifts, and/or personal subreddits/websites/social media on AGW. **[NEW SELLER RULES. ALL SELLERS MUST READ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsiansGoneWild/wiki/index/seller-rules)**

* **No** asking for karma or upvotes in titles or comments.

* **No** male posts unless they are accompanied by an Asian female. Asian males can post at /r/BigAsianCock or /r/AsianLadybonergw.

* **No** posting women (this includes girlfriends, wives, FWB, and SO) without their verification here or from another subreddit. AGW is a place for women to voluntarily post self-pics, *not a place to post pics of other people*.

* **No** pics of general Asian amateurs. That can be done at /r/nextdoorasians or /r/realasians.

* **No** personal information about posters. Not even guessing of names or locations, even in jest. They will be removed and even a possible banning.

* **No** abusive behavior or personal attacks. **Please report bullying and abusive posts**. We check reports regularly. Let's have a fun place where posters feel comfortable sharing their content.

C_S_T,6,"#####**CRITICAL SHOWER THOUGHTS:**
A safe place to discuss outside-of-the-box thinking. 

#####Post Guidelines
Most subjects are welcome here; C_S_T is more a style of thinking than a list of topics. 

**We do ask that you add a few sentences to the text box of the post explaining the title or giving some context.** Links are disabled for a reason; don't simply put a link in the self text. Drama from other subs is not welcome here. Posts that don't conform to this simple request will be deem low-effort, or ""shit-posts,"" and are subject to removal. Repeat offenders are subject to a ban. 

#####The Golden Rule

Treat others with respect and avoid conversations devolving into insults. 

If you feel the need, **attack the argument, not the person**. Link to sources that further explain your view, and debate the sources on their factual basis. Personal attacks or [logical fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) are an inferior debate technique and not suitable for this sub. Most users will be given a warning. Repeat offenders may be subject to a ban (which may be permanent).

#####Post Flairs

We have a number of flairs that grant certain protections on the discussion. Please read the links about each flair for more details. If you can't flair a post, just add the flair name to the title, e.g. *[Premise] ...*

* **[Premise](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/wiki/rules#wiki_.5Bpremise.5D) —**
Commenters on the thread must entertain the OP's thought, meaning you can't disagree with the basic premise. If you do disagree, either downvote and move on or create your own thread to discuss it. Please view the [[Premise](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/wiki/rules#wiki_.5Bpremise.5D)] rules wiki for more details. Breaking these rules may result in mod action.  

* **[CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/wiki/rules#wiki_.5Bcmv.5D) —**
Change my view. The converse of [Premise] post, commenters are encouraged to try to argue against OP's position. Keep in mind that some users make CMV posts they don't necessarily agree with to play devil's advocate. 

* **[Meta](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/wiki/rules#wiki_.5Bmeta.5D) —**
Only for discussions about this sub itself. Should be used *very* sparingly. 

* **[6hats](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/wiki/rules#wiki_.5B6hats.5D_-_experimental) —**
Still experimental. Please read the [[6hats]](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/wiki/rules#wiki_.5B6hats.5D_-_experimental) rules wiki for more information, and include a link to that page if you decide to post one of these.

* **[Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/wiki/rules#wiki_.5Bdiscussion.5D) —**
Everything else. Most posts should use this flair, and only our standard sub rules apply. 

#####Moderation Policy

In our efforts to remain as censor-free as possible, we generally do not delete comments. Furthermore, we try to approach moderation as ""Hands-Off"" as possible in these concerns. We still encourage Reporting offenses of the Golden Rule, as it helps us to monitor for the potential to intervene, if necessary.

#####Transparency

To further support a censor-free environment, we have added /u/publicmodlogs to our mod team, which publishes every mod action on [this go1dfish.me website](https://r.go1dfish.me/r/C_S_T/about/log).

###About \/r/Videos [chat](https://discord.gg/videos#dis)
* A great place for video content of all kinds. Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

---
###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) 

#0. Videos Only
* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.

*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos

#1. No Politics
* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. 

* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)

#2. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting
* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding ""Reddit Justice"" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#3. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. 

* No URL shorteners. 

* No links to playlists or to channel pages.

#4. No Porn, Gore, or Death.

* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.

#5. No Solicitation of Votes or Views

* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.

* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.

* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like ""this person deserves more views,"" ""not enough people have seen this person's videos,"" or ""show this person some love.""

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#6. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

#7. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts

* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. 

* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.

* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.

* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.

* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout

#8. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.
](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)

#9. No Self Promotion

* *""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.""* - Confucius

* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on reddit (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.

###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos#mods)

#Removals & Warnings
* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.

* *Note: Submissions from new users, and users with low karma, are automatically removed to help prevent spam.*

* Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly! When reporting, please explain why you think it should be removed. 

* **Do not** message moderators individually about posts not appearing in the new queue or ban appeals. Messages should be sent as a modmail to /r/Videos. Failure to do so may result in a ban.


#Submit Feedback

 * Send us a mod mail anytime or head to our Discord linked above.

A place for the shittiest, most mocking ""pro-tips"" you can think of.  Whether you want to let us know how glue can help out your hair or the quickest way to clog a public toilet, we're the place to post.

If your post does not appear in the new tab after several minutes, it may have been caught by our spam filter.  If this happens, send a message to the mods and we'll get it fixed up for you!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**WHAT IS A LIFE PRO TIP?**
A Life Pro Tip (or LPT) is a tip that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Rules:**

1. The post must contain a  life pro tip that is **shitty**.  This isn't a dumping ground for shitty statements.  Any tips that are actual good advice will be removed at the discretion of the mod team.  What constitutes shitty is hard to explain, but much like porn, we know it when we see it. 

2. We will remove all posts with the tip ""Kill Yourself"" or any variation thereof.  Not because we don't want you to kill yourself (we do), but we have seen every single combination of this tip, and are sick of them.  They aren't original.

2. Reposts are lame.  Also, posting the same ""SLPT: repost for more karma!"" image is bad and if you do that, you are a bad person. In fact, let's make an attempt to not repost at all, let's make our ancestors proud, mkay?  If you post something in our top 25 of all time, you'll likely be banned without warning for being ignorant or illiterate.  We're sick of removing your shit.

2. Circlejerking is lame too.  Simply copying a popular post from here, or LPT and putting a minor twist to it so it's ""shitty"" is also unoriginal, and we will probably remove those too if we see them. 

1. Being gross for the sake of being gross will get your post removed at the Mod's discretion.  Most of these include bodily functions and fluids, or rape etc.  Pretty much anything posted simply for shock value.


1.  **Finally, If you act like a racist, spammer, or are being a general douchenozzle, the mods reserve the right to ban your ass without warning.**

>will show up as

>[Spoiler](/s ""spoiler-text"")
> or
> >!spoiler-text!<

##**2. No separate posts about the latest chapter for 24 hours after the release**
>- To prevent the subreddit from getting flooded with posts. 
>- The discussion and theories thread are the place to discuss the chapter. You must wait a day to post any other discussions in a thread. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**3. Fanart/cosplay must directly link to the source**
>* Use [saucenao.com](http://saucenao.com/)  and [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)  to find the source. [More >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/rules#wiki_3._fanart.2Fcosplay_must_directly_link_to_the_source)

##**4. Plain panels/scenes must create discourse**
>- **Don't post links to plain (or slightly edited) panels, pages, screenshots, gifs or scenes from the manga & anime.**
>- If you want to discuss a certain page/scene from the manga/anime please accompany it with an original analysis or discussion provoking questions. Otherwise it is considered a low effort type of post and will be removed. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**5. Posts must be directly related to One Piece**
>- The general rule of thumb is that if only a title or caption makes it One Piece related, the post is not allowed. 
>- This includes pictures/videos of things in real life which look similar to something from One Piece.
>- However, this is only a general guideline and the actual enforcement of the rule may vary based on content submitted. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**6. Mind our self promotion policy**
> - Self-promotion should be thoughtful, limited, and consistently well received by the community. The [9:1 ratio](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) should be generally followed.
>- **In addition, Youtube reviews and theorist videos must:**
> 1. Be in a text post format.
> 2. Summarise your video for the community or create new points to further the discussion of the videos.
>- [More >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/rules#wiki_6._mind_our_self_promotion_policy)

##**7. No memes**
> * Use /r/memepiece. Subscribe to them! Also try /r/WrongPiece
> * Short jokes, and shit-posts are also memes
> * High quality, hand drawn, original content art, that is a meme may sometimes be allowed. See the full rules for examples. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**8. No hentai**
> - **No hentai.** Use /r/funpiece (NSFW) for that.
> - Anything too explicit but not necessarily hentai may also be removed. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**9. No posts about One Piece games other than news**
> - /r/OnePieceTC exists for One Piece Treasure Cruise
> - Posts for promotion of the game subreddits are allowed, following the self promotion rule. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**10. Do not repost questions answered in the FAQ or sidebar**
>- Use the search bar, your search engine, and the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/faq) to ensure that you are not reposting recent content or already answered questions. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)
>- [Click here for recently asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/search?q=flair%3Ahelp&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)

##**11. Don't be rude**
> * Stalking, harassment, and personal attacks will not be tolerated.
> * Racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, ableism or any other hatred will not be tolerated.
> * Do not feed the trolls. If you suspect trolling, report and ignore.
> * Trolling, baiting, or (obviously) provocative comments/post may be removed at moderator discretion.
> * Remember [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**12. Flair your posts**
>- You can add a flair to your post after submission by clicking the 'flair' button underneath your post.
>- Unflaired posts will be automatically removed until one is selected.

It's not original content if you didn't make it yourself and if you didn't make it yourself there's a chance other people have also seen it, taken a photo/screenshot and posted it online. This effect is multiplied exponentially when it comes to mass-produced ads found on the internet. Just check the mega thread, top and new before posting.

NO REDDIT ADS

If you do receive a temporary ban, don't complain to the mods. Whining about your suspension will earn you an added 5 day suspension. You will also receive a temporary 5-day ban if you argue with the moderators about removing your post.

pussypassdenied,2,"Welcome to /r/pussypassdenied, where women are not allowed to use their gender as a handicap or an excuse to act like assholes. Yay equality!


[](https://www.reddit.com)


**THIS IS NOT /R/BEATINGWOMEN.** /r/pussypassdenied is not for misogynists, racists, or otherwise douchy types of individuals. To be clear: **PPD DOES NOT MEAN THAT A WOMAN NEEDS TO REFER VERBALLY TO HER GENDER. FEMINIST ACTS, A MAN DEFENDING HIMSELF, AND OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE WOMEN DO SOMETHING THAT IMPLIES THEY WILL SUFFER NO REPERCUSSIONS ARE FAIR GAME.**

***REASONABLY THOUGHT OUT EXPOSURE OF FEMINISM IS A GRAY AREA. VISIBILITY OF SAID POSTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY VOTES.*** 

Any post that shows physical force against a woman that wasn’t instigated or excessive retaliation to instigation will be removed. Please report if you see a violation of this rule.

*You are highly encouraged to take the piss out of us Mods. We have thick skins and can take it. Users are encouraged to utilize flagging to report violations. There must be a little wiggle room, and violations that are too narrow minded will be ignored.
PPD isn’t something that is black and white, so address an OP’s post if you don’t understand how they thought their post was PPD. Finally, users are encouraged to relax and not take their flair so seriously. Follow the rules, have fun. Embrace the flair. LOVE the flair.*

1. Please no trolling, harassment, rudeness, or behaviour unbecoming of the wholesome users we know you to be. Keep comments civil and be respectful of your fellow users. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/5qd45d/swearing_and_wholesome_memes/)    
Be nice. This is a happy place.     
No proselytizing. Keep your religion, your politics, your diet, and any other crusade you might carry to yourself. We come here to get away from arguing and politics and the like, so please respect that by keeping your agendas to yourself.

1. Please do not post personal info, yours or others. All names should be blocked out, except public figures.  Also, private communication is private; please don't post it here.  

1. Please link to images directly. This makes browsing easier for those using RES or through a mobile device.

1. Please do not post low effort memes (upvote memes, metareddit, etc.) This includes ""Let's get this to the front page!"" type posts, ""You have been visited by"", ""people who sort by new"", ""stop scrolling"", ""check your data"" 4th wall interaction type meta posts, posts that mention reddit karma, upvotes, and ""I don't want upvotes but..."" type posts. Additionally, it includes low effort memes such as Skyrim ""Wholesome 100"", ""You're Breathtaking"", Thanos ""That does put a smile on my face"", [happiness noises], Fallout [Everybody liked that], and ""Because that's what heroes do"". [See here for more on this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/caocrq/rule_7_clarification_and_update/)

1. Please avoid re-posting memes. (Browsing Top/New posts can help, also [Tineye](https://www.tineye.com/) & other image searches.)   Do not spam or post more than 3 memes in a 24 hour period.

1. Please make an effort with your title. Avoid generic titles, try to be descriptive or fun.

###Subreddit Rules

**I.** Your post **MUST** include [H] for ""Have"", and [W] for ""Want"". You must also include the platform(s) you're planning to trade in. **No Shitposts. Use /r/RLEMemes for memes.**

#####Good title example: 

`[PC] [H] Pink Zomba Wheels [W] Offers `


#####Bad title example: 

` Anyone want to trade for Frostbite?? `

You can also use [Discussion], [Meta], [Question], [Auction], [Price Check], and [Store] as tags.

Your item ***must*** be able to be traded at the moment of posting, no fake posts. You **must** own the item(s) and platform(s) you are posting (no posting for friends etc). Trades cannot be influenced on wording (cheap, quicksale, etc).

**II.** You cannot offer or request money/non RL item exchanges on the subreddit OUTSIDE of the stickied Anything-Goes thread. (Paypal, gift cards, etc). You cannot make wager matches, blind trading posts/trading games, raffle posts, item begging posts, offer/request boosting/coaching services, or account sell/buy/mod **anywhere** on this subreddit.

**III.** Whether you are posting an item up for trade, or offering on a post by another user, you MUST keep all conversations out in the open to ensure all users are liable for their actions. No PM’ing or asking users to PM you to negotiate a deal outside of the ATG thread. Listing platform gamertags, IDs, friend codes, or references to negotiating elsewhere is not allowed.

**IV.** You can only make one post every half hour to avoid spam abuse. Usage of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban of the alt and a 7 day *minimum* for the main account.

**V.** Do not harass other users. Flaming (insulting users directly, name-calling, hate speech) may result in a temporary or a permanent ban from the subreddit at a moderator's discretion.

**VI.** Do not hijack active trades (no trade sniping). If you want to request or offer an item, do it on your own thread or wait until the offer has been declined or completed. This includes giving unwanted advice/tips on another user's sale (no price policing).

**VII.** Giveaways and blueprint revealing/trade-up streams (or videos) must be planned with moderators before being promoted. [Read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/ap6q3r/meta_clarifying_rule_7giveaways/?) Streams may only be promoted once per month by ***active*** users of the subreddit after moderator review.

**VIII.** If you were scammed, report them through [ModMail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRocketLeagueExchange) with proof. Do not post about being scammed unless you've contacted ModMail for permission and that person has been added to the [Scam List](https://rltracker.pro/scam_list). Posting about someone scamming with no evidence or linking their scam list entry will result in a minimum 3 day ban. No witch hunting unless convicted scammer.

**IX.** If you're having an auction, please read and follow the [auction rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/fingk8/meta_auction_formatting_rules/) 

This subreddit follows [Reddit content policy.](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/)

**The emergency sirens are tested at 12pm and 7pm on the first Friday of each month**
     
There are three parts to the test - a sustained siren (representing a weather emergency - aka, a tornado), a warbled siren (representing an ""other"" emergency), and an announcement (for authorities to convey critical information via the emergency loudspeakers in case of ongoing emergency).

If the weather is (or is forecast to be) severe on the first Friday, the test will not take place.

PublicFreakout,4,"##### [Join our Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/tcneqz7)

##About:

A subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public. Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.

Saturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)

##Rules:

1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns

2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders

3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban

4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)

5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]

6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.

7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.

8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).

9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.

10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.

11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.

[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.

**[Follow Up]**- A news article or other report which follows up on a video that was previously posted to the subreddit. Please include a link to the original freakout if possible. 

**[Protest Freakout]** - Videos of Protests and the Freakouts that occur during the protest.

**[Compilation]** - A compilation of freakouts

**[Possibly Fake]** - Might have been staged

##Avoid:

**[Fake]** - Staged freakouts

**[Non-Public]** - Non-public freakouts

**[Non-Freakout]** - Submissions that are not freakouts

##Filters:

## User Rules

* All content that is unrelated to The Walking Dead will be removed (**this includes generic image macros and reaction images**).  Just because something is zombie-related doesn't automatically make it TWD-related. Likewise, just because a cast member acted in something else doesn't make it TWD related either.

* Do not put spoilers in the title of your post.

* Use a reliable image host like imgur and link directly to the image.

* To keep content fresh, reposts will be removed at moderator discretion.

* No shitposting.

* No bitching if your post is removed for being a shitpost.

* Linking to illegally hosted content may result in a ban.

* Don't be a jerk.

^We ^reserve ^the ^right ^to ^moderate ^at ^our ^own ^discretion.

## Piracy

We want to keep our subreddit legit for the cast and crew that have worked with us past and future. Posts or comments linking to any type of unauthorized distribution of any branch of The Walking Dead franchise will be removed. We will not censor our IRC channel, because it is a great medium for free speech and we support that.  We understand that certain users have limited access to the show, and can only obtain it through illegal means. We simply ask that you keep those discussion of piracy elsewhere, and not on this particular subreddit."

##Spoiler tags and Furigana

* **Spoilers in submissions**:

  If your submission contain spoilers, mark it as spoilers *after* submitting, [like this](http://i.imgur.com/zHCJdJU.png). 

  If there are untagged spoilers in your submission, mark it as spoilers. 

* **When to use spoiler tags**:

  In threads *not* marked as spoilers always use spoiler tags everywhere in the comments.

  In threads that *are* marked as spoilers: no need to use spoiler tags, but keep the submitter's level of knowledge about the VN in mind. Play it safe.

  *Always* use spoiler tags in threads that are not about one specific VN. The only exceptions are series (e.g. Ace Attorney), but only if OP makes it clear that discussing all games in a series without spoiler tags is okay.

* **How to use spoiler tags**:

  Hide spoilers like this: \>!hidden spoilery text!< which shows up as >!hidden spoilery text!<. Make sure there are no spaces at the beginning and end of the spoiler tag because this will break it for users on http://old.reddit.com/. In other words do this: >!properly hidden spoiler!<, but not this: >! broken spoiler tag !<


* **Furigana**:

  To use furigana in your posts, use the following syntax:

  \[正義の味方](#fg ""せいぎのみかた"")

  which will display [正義の味方](#fg ""せいぎのみかた"") on old Reddit. The quotation marks are not optional.

##Submitting a post

* **Announcements:**

  If a VNDB page for a newly announced VN is available, make sure to post it in the comments when you've submitted the post.

* **NSFW**:

  *After* submitting, mark the submission with the NSFW tag if unhidden 18+ material is contained in the post. 

* **Unallowed Posts**:

  No non-VN related submissions, no reposts from within under a year, no low-effort submissions. [Details](/r/visualnovels/wiki/rules).

* **Images**:

  Images, Screenshots, and Memes related to Visual Novels are currently fine to post. Just make sure to space out your posts in moderation. If you post a screenshot, you are required to post a name of the visual novel in the title as well as tagging the topic with spoilers.

* **Self-promotion, crowdfunding, and Kickstarters**:

  Make sure topic title has Visual Novel name, make sure Project has narration and emphasis on reading, make sure updates are only major milestones, space out new asset/poll updates once every 2 weeks.  [Details here.](/r/visualnovels/wiki/rules)

* **Giveaways & selling stuff**:

  Giveaway and selling posts are fine. Just make sure to post some kind of picture proof if selling anything physical. [Tips here.](/r/visualnovels/wiki/rules)

##General

* **Piracy**:

  Don't ask for or link to illegal downloads, don't mention sites where illegal downloads are hosted, and don't encourage illegal downloading. Translation patches are allowed.

* **Behavior**:

  Be respectful. Personal insults are not allowed and will at the very least result in a temporary ban.

* **Non-VN related threads**

  Submissions unrelated to VNs are discouraged. Use the weekly Off-topic threads or the Weekly Question threads for personal things like saying hello, thanks, goodbye, or asking to be Steam friends. News about VN adaptions is allowed.

**Official Subreddit of the PC Master Race** We're the largest community of PC enthusiasts on the Internet. [Begin your ascension today](//pcmasterrace.org/guide)!

#General Information

* Everybody is welcome here, even those that have yet to ascend.
* Every kind of PC related content is welcome here. This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.
* You don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to love PCs. It's not about the hardware in your rig, but [the software in your heart!](//twitter.com/PedroPCMR/status/570009579637092352)
* This is not a satirical or 'circlejerk subreddit'. [Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.
* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).
* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).
* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/pcmasterrace).

#[Rules](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules)

For an in-depth explanation of our rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules).

* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).
* [**Rule #2**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.232) We will not allow behavior contrary to [PCMR Etiquette](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/etiquette), e.g. brigading, witch-hunting, asking for upvotes or downvotes, enabling piracy, flamebaiting, clickbaiting, intentional rudeness, text spamming, using all caps or emojis/smileys/emoticons in titles or overusing them in comments, meta-reddit or meta-subreddit drama or complaints.
* [**Rule #3**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.233) Don't link to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links and archived links. Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.
* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.
* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.
* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: 
 - 6.1: Content that is either low quality, unrelated, especially unoriginal, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren't PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys that aren't academic in nature (and have been pre-approved by the mod team).
 - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.
 - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.
 - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.
 - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).
 - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.
* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.
* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.
* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.
* [**Rule #10**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.2310) Screenshots of ""peasantry,"" including but not limited to conversations on Reddit, other websites or sms/chat screenshots where ignorance is being spewed and/or ridiculed, must be text posts.

#Giveaway Rules

For an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).

* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.
* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).
* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.
* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.
* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).
* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.
* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.
* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.
* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.
* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.

**GIF links cannot contain sound**

**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* click the report button and leave a report, and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem.**


1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**
 * Do not post GIFs that have already appeared on /r/GIFs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post GIFs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to GIF formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

 **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

 Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.

2. **No Reaction, Meme, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote GIFs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post GIFs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, subtitles, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the GIF).  **Duration must be twenty seconds or less.  †**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single GIF image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.  [READ MORE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/wiki/rule9)

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**† We may allow multiple cuts and/or GIFs up to a minute long depending on the popularity of a post. Sound, text boxes, and GIFs that heavily depend on captions are still not allowed.**

&nbsp;

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/GIFs.

#Welcome to the unofficial subreddit for OnePlus.

---

##Rules
1. **Be nice.** This sub is about smartphones and we expect everyone to use civil language. Need a refresher on how to behave on the internet? [Check the reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

2. **Search function. Use it.** Low effort posts, overly-discussed topics and articles that have already been posted are subject to removal. Saw one? Report it. That includes any post that is not directly related to OnePlus or the OP community.

3. **No direct sales.** Members may not attempt to sell or buy a particular item within this sub.

4. **Obey reddits content policy.** [Read it here](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

5. **Obey reddits reddiquette.** [Read it here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Seriously. Read it.

5. **Self-promotion will not be tolerated.** General rule of thumb: less than 10% of your posts should link to your own content. For more info check [reddits guidelines for self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). 

##Content Philosophy
**Content which benefits the community is valued over content which benefits only the individual.** That means that technical questions, help about buying/selling, rants, self-promotion and similiar things are subject to removal by our own discretion. We encourage you to post about news & rumors and start discussions that add value to our community.

**If you don't see your post on /new or have any other questions/concerns please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Foneplus).**

---

##Link flair
**Submissions must be labeled with a flair based on their content.** While we do not enforce this rule, it helps filtering and finding posts that interest you. These flairs are available as of right now:


+ **News** — News  about OnePlus and their products (rumors allowed)  
+ **Accessories** — Backcovers, cases, pockets and other gadgets  
+ **Development** — Discussion about official/unofficial development  
+ **PSA** — Useful piece of information  
+ **General discussion** — For everything you can't find above
+ **Custom** — If even _General discussion_ doesn't fit...

##User flair

Parenting,2,"######Make this subreddit a better place! Vote and participate in the [new section](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/new/?sort=new) and report rule violations.


/r/Parenting is a subreddit for anything related to the controlled chaos we call parenting. 

Do you have a question for parents?  Head over to /r/AskParents.  

Did your kid say something awesome?  Join us at /r/thingsmykidsaid.  

Are you a caregiver or nanny?  Check out /r/nanny.  

We also recommend /r/relationships, /r/legaladvice and /r/family. 

#####Community Rules
1. Only Parents or Guardians May Create New Posts
 * Parents/guardians are any person who has substantial decision-making authority in a child's life. However, it’s okay for anyone to comment, provided it’s on-topic and within rules. Indicate you're a parent or guardian, or self-select your user flair, to avoid confusion/accidental moderation. Non-parents/guardians that still have pressing questions for parents can utilize the weekly ""Ask Parents Anything"" thread in this sub or visit r/AskParents.
1. Be Decent & Civil
 * Remember the Human! Disagree but remain respectful; don’t insult people or their children, name-call, or be intentionally rude. Bullying, including baiting/antagonizing, and brigading of either individual users or subreddits will not be tolerated. Reporting posts that violate this rule is the best way to get it noticed by the moderation team.
1. No Medical & Legal Advice
 * Reddit and the internet, in general, are not the best places to get or give medical or legal advice. Support for established medical and legal situations is allowed. Do not ask about symptoms, post pictures, or ask if you should seek a medical professional. Do not ask if something is legal/illegal, if you should call the police, engage an attorney, or call child welfare agencies. Commenters should not offer medical or legal advice. Always consult a professional in these matters. Additionally, you may also consider posting on r/legaladvice for legal advice.
1. No surveys, studies, or interviews
 * Absolutely no surveys, studies, petitions, interview requests or invitations to participate are permitted. This includes anything done for profit, academia, school, free, or for personal information. Please consider posting instead to r/samplesize.
1. No linking, promotion, or advertising
 * We do not allow spam, self-promotion, marketing research, fundraising, petitions, solicitation of feedback, or any material that looks to use the community for benefit of themselves or anybody else. Non-promotional linking is also discouraged, especially if it's the main focus of the submission.  This rule applies to both posts and comments.
1. We are a discussion-first sub
 * This subreddit is discussion-based, and does not want blog posts, YouTube channels, open letters, pictures, or memes, or anything similar. This rule applies to posts and comments. Please check our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to.
1. No Sexual Content Involving Minors
 * Most content describing sexual acts that involve minors (even when no adults are involved) will usually be removed. Self-exploration and sex can be a normal part of human growth and development. If you are worried your child is outside the range of normal please see a professional for advice. If you are worried about the sexual abuse of a minor please see your child's doctor, local police, or child welfare agency as soon as possible.
1. General Posting and Moderation
 * Moderators can remove or approve any content at their discretion. If you feel something of yours was erroneously removed - reach out. We'd be glad to discuss it cordially. We only discuss moderation with the impacted user, not general curiosity seekers. Please help us by reporting posts and comments that don't meet the standard of our community for review! Your human moderators thank you for your patience and understanding.
1. **Rule P** - No Photos of Children
 * Sometimes you want to post a picture of your little one, maybe to illustrate something that's happened to them, or to just share!  We currently do not allow pictures of your little ones to be posted here, due to privacy and safety concerns.  Please check out our [recommendation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/other_subreddits) for other communities to post to instead!
1. **Rule S** - Things My Kid Said Threads
 * We have the **""Things My Kid Said""** weekly thread about things your kids have said.  Please consider saving your submission for this thread instead!

# Rules
*hover for details*

[Formatted](https://old.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/about/rules/)

|||
|:------|:---|
|No non-ragecomics allowed|If you aren't telling a story, there are no characters, action, or similar, then it is not a rage comic.|
|Absolutely no random comic generators|No good ever comes out of them, they are unfunny and trash|
|Good reposting only, and mention that if your post is a repost.|This subreddit is for quality content only, meaning comics that are funny or at least will make the reader smile on the inside, also only repost 6-month old posts or older|
|No meta-posts|Don't make a comic complaining about another user, comic, or the moderators. Additionally, don't make comics to *“introduce”* a new rageface|
|NSFW tags are free and a must|Please use NSFW tags for anything that might have the remote possibility of getting someone fired or in trouble|
|Comics must be more than a panel |We don't want single panels|
|No blogposts|Blogposts are preachy, self-serving, boring comics. These often take the form of a full-panel stare face lecturing someone, posts about how your dog/cat/grandpa died, and similar. Your post must be *relatable*, not a personal anecdote|
|No vote-begging|Do not mention cakedays, karma, upvotes, or anything similar|
|No non-imgur / Reddit images|If your comic is from some site other than imgur or Reddit, then it is not permitted, and **will** be removed as spam.  Also, please link **directly** to the image|
|No dead horse beating|Avoid tropes of rage comics, including, but not limited to `[FIRST]`, `Extra Panel`,  and `Made for Reddit`|
|Mods have the final say|If a comic is removed by a moderator, even if it doesn't seem to violate any of the other rules, it remains removed|


----

# FAQ
*hover for details*

|||
|-|-|
|Why isn't my comic on the ""new"" tab?|Give it a second. It was probably caught by the evil robotic spam filter, but we've created an even more powerful robot to save everything from the filter; it just can take a couple of minutes. If it still doesn't work, it was probably removed for breaking a rule (read them!).|
|Can I be a moderator, too?|As much as we love when community members want to help out, we can't accept requests for becoming moderators, or we'd be overwhelmed with nothing but such requests. Therefore, requesting to be a moderator will actually result in you getting banned instead. When we feel we need more moderators, we recruit from a list of people we have identified as being helpful and positive role models for the community. If you want to be a mod one day, that's how you'll go about doing it|
|How do I get flair?|If you ask for flair, we will **never** give it to you, no matter how many blowjobs you offer|

----------RULEZ----------

These are all very important rules you MUST follow, or there will be bad consequences!

1. Only Shitposts Allowed:
Anyone caught posting serious, informative content will get a slap over the hand and told to sit in the naughty corner!

2. Harassment or generally nasty comments:
Mean comments said about other people online can have a very real effect on that person offline. Don't say something about someone if you couldn't take it yourself. This results in an instant permanent ban.

3. Keep it clean:
Everyone should enjoy coming here, so don't use any personal attacks, bigotry, racism, sexism or otherwise inappropriate behavior or content. Comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users could result in an instant ban.

4. NSFW:
Absolutely no porn or gore, and if a post is NSFW, mark it as that.

5. Breaking of Reddit rules:
If anyone is caught breaking Reddit rules, they could be banned. Just don't do it.

1. [Be excellent with each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/index). 

2. Be mindful regarding spoilers. Reddit's universal \>!Spoiler Tags!< are mandatory when discussing plot details of movies.

3. If you wish to be banned, do any of the following: Be rude, harass, ignore the subreddit's rules, promote your site/blog/article/channel/etc., promote your app/company, or post about a movie you worked on. [This subreddit isn't your link farm.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion#wiki_guidelines_for_self-promotion_on_reddit)

4. Due to Administrators' past actions against this subreddit, we have a ***ZERO*** tolerance policy regarding piracy. You will be banned if you request or share links to full features, if you ask or inform how to pirate, or if you mention a pirating site/app/etc.

5. For Requesting posts:
  * Use the search bar before making a request
  * Use a descriptive title that lets people know if they might be able to help or not
  * Double check that your request wouldn't be more suitable in one of the subreddits outlined in Rule #8
  * We require a minimum of 125 characters in the body of the post to ensure quality requests and suggestions

6. For Suggesting posts:
  * Suggest a single film, and no more than one every 24 hours
  * Encouraged: Start the title of the post with the film's title and its release year in parentheses: *Film Name (Year)*
  * Whet the appetite, don't go into detail
  * Do not repeat a Suggestion that has been posted in the last 3 months
  * Don't suggest a Barred Film (listed in the sidebar/wiki)
  * Only suggest a film you've seen and enjoyed
  * We require a minimum of 125 characters in the body of the post to ensure quality suggestions

7. Links must be to neutral informative sources; such as TheMovieDB, Letterboxd, Rotten Tomatoes or Wikipedia. Both Youtube and IMDb are not considered a neutral source. Again, be mindful that [this subreddit isn't your link farm](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

8. The subreddit isn't meant for:
  * Identifying a film. Use r/tipofmytongue
  * Asking for suggestions based on a film/list of films without any more details. Use r/ifyoulikeblank
  * Film reviews. Use r/moviecritic, r/moviereviews (more are mentioned in the sidebar)
  * Requesting or suggesting a TV show. Use r/televisionsuggestions, r/ifyoulikeblank
  * Asking where to stream a film. Use sites like JustWatch, MovieFone, ReelGood
  * Sharing an idea for a film. Use r/movieideas
  * Asking how a scene was created. Use r/Filmmakers

# Barred Suggestions

These are films that you cannot make a **Suggesting post** for because the community already knows about them. This means they are very good or at least largely popular. (note that this doesn't apply to comments on Requesting posts)

* 12 Angry Men (1957)
* Coherence
* Donnie Darko
* Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
* Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)
* Knives Out
* The Man from Earth
* Oldboy (2003)
* Parasite (2019)
* The Prestige
* Whiplash

OldSchoolCool,10,"**History's cool kids, looking fantastic!**

A pictorial and video celebration of history's coolest kids, everything from beatniks to bikers, mods to rude boys, hippies to ravers. And everything in between. 

If you've found a photo, video, or photo essay of people from the past looking fantastic, here's the place to share it.     

**PLEASE READ OUR SEVEN QUICK RULES:**

1: Photos and videos must be over 25 years old. 

2: Please put the year or decade in title, otherwise your post will be removed. 

3: Spam, racist, homophobic, sexist and offensive comments, as well as brigading, consistent reposting and shitposting, will result in a lifetime ban. Offensive comments include anything about pimping, about people's moms and scoring women. Nobody cares about your sexual impulses, least of all the OP.

4: All posts highlighting, in the title, that someone has recently passed away or titles trying to evoke sympathy upvotes will be deleted. Please add the info in the comments.

5: All reposts less than six months old and all reposts less than a year old from Top 100 will be removed. 

6: All posts must feature a person.  

7: We reserve the right to remove any post that doesn't showcase historical coolness. This includes photos, which are not obviously retro and portraits of famous young women doing nothing but posing.

nottheonion,7,"**Review current posts to avoid reposting.**

For **true stories** that are so mind-blowingly ridiculous, that you could have sworn it was an [Onion story](http://theonion.com/).

[](/spikeholdup) Please note that we are an editorialized subreddit based on what we feel meets our subjective quality and humour guidelines as curators of this subreddit. Most submissions do not make the cut, and please do not treat removals under rule 2 as a personal attack, they simply happen with our content model.

### Rules - **[hover or click here for full version](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/expanded)**

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1. Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|
|2. Submit only if “Oniony”. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/offbeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be ""Oniony"". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|
|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|
|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|
|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it’s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|
|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|
|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|
|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|
|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|
|10. No mobile versions. | If you’re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically “.m” or “mobile”) from the url before submitting.|
|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren’t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|

bikewrench,3,"A community of cyclists - some with questions, some answers

### Post questions to get help.

Post your problems, and we will try to get your bike rolling again.  It really, really helps if you can provide pictures and/or video.

You can also consult our **[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/wiki/bikewrenchfaq)** or the list of **[people willing to help locally](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/wiki/local_help)**. 

**Post Rules and Guidelines**

* Questions about bike repair only. If you just want to post a picture, this isn't the place for it.  [Full rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/about/rules/).

* ""Is this cracked / safe to ride?"" - If you have to ask, don't ride it. We probably can't tell from a picture just what condition your bike is in. Take it to your Local Bike Shop and ask them. If it's carbon, a specialist repair shop may be required. They should have the equipment and expertise to inspect it properly.


* Please use the weekly thread for post follow ups and acknowledgments. Tag helpful commenters if you want them to receive a notification.

### Comment Rules

1. Play nice

2. Stay on topic / No jokes, especially not false answers as jokes.

guitars,7,"**Info about /r/guitars:**

**________________________________**

/r/guitars is a place for people to post pictures of and discuss everything about guitars i.e. electric, acoustic, lap, steel, bass, amps, pedals, strings, picks, etc. Basically anything with strings. Feel free to post pics of your own gear, cool gear you saw online or anything else as long as it complies with the rules. 

**Rules**

* Spam posts advertising websites offering services such as guitar lessons is not allowed, especially if it is your own website, and will be removed.

* **Respect others opinions**. We are all different and we all like different things such as guitar brands or amp brands.

* **Don't downvote people for asking questions or asking for advice**. The downvote button is not a disagreement button, its for getting rid of irrelevant, rude or other posts that don't add anything relevant to the sub.

* Posting music videos or gear demos is alright as long as it is for the purpose of discussing the video, such as asking about gear used by a guitarist, asking about gear being demoed, etc. Posting multiple videos from your own YouTube channel (or a friends) to promote it is not allowed.

* If you are unsure if a post you are about to make is against the rules, message the mods and we will help you out.

* **Please give feedback**. Don't like something about the sub? Message the mods and we'll see what we can do, even if it is just something as simple as a button being a colour you don't like.

* **Don't hate on other players' gear**. If its not your style, you can either convey your distaste respectfully, or not at all. This is a subreddit for civil discussion, not hate and trolling.

* **Don't pawn your stuff here**. There are other subreddits to look for gear and to sell it, one of which you will find below.

* Moderators have full discretion.

[**RULES OF THE ROAST:** (click for details)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/about/rules/)

**Roastees:**

 * You must provide at least one high-quality picture of the roastee holding a handwritten sign with the text /r/RoastMe - Phones and Snapchat text overlay is **NOT** allowed! Your hand and at least an implication of a complete arm must be visible.

* Posts may contain multiple images, either natively through Reddit's multi-image feature or hosted on Imgur. All images in an album post must *only* contain the roastee(s), and the first image *must* have a sign (e.g. old pictures of you the roastee as a young child are allowed so long as a current picture of them with a sign is present).

 * All individuals in the picture must be holding the r/RoastMe sign or indicate they are aware of the sign in some way (e.g. by pointing to it). Photos with non-Roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.

 * Photoshopped/edited posts are **NOT** allowed. This **includes** Snapchat filters such as the digitally-added flowers or dog ears. Posting multiple edited photos will result in a ban.

 * Your post will not appear until after it has been approved by a moderator. Please send [this message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/roastme&subject=Post Not Approved&message=Hello, I don't believe my post has been approved yet. Could you please approve my post? Add link to post here: (Make sure you link to the reddit post, not the imgur!\)) if it takes longer than 1 hour.

 * The minimum posting age is **18** years old, your post will be rejected if you look younger or if context clues lead us to conclude you are younger.

 * By submitting a Roast, you agree to your picture being saved, hosted on Imgur, and reposted to Reddit for the purpose of inclusion on ""Best Of"" and ""Highlights"" albums.

 * Your face must be at least 60% visible in the photo.

 * You may post on behalf of other people, provided that the post follows all of the other rules listed above, and it is clear that the person being posted consents to the roast.

 * No joke roasts. Anyone posting a dog, or a ham, or Anne Frank, or Donald Trump, or anything like that will be banned for 3 days. It's not funny.

 * No sexualized content. There are plenty of humiliation fetish subreddits for you, and we aren't one of them.


 * No ads. No onlyfans

**Roasters:**

 * This is a comedy subreddit, not a hate subreddit. Act as though you are trying to make an audience laugh. Please familiarize yourself with all rules before participating.

* This is also not /r/ToastMe. You are here to roast, not flatter. 

 * You *are* allowed to look through the roastee's post history. Do ***not*** roast a roastee anywhere outside of this subreddit. Any such outside harassment is not sanctioned by /r/RoastMe, and will result in a ban upon discovery.

 * Never post another user's personal information, referred to as 'doxxing'. We will always report violations to the admins.

 * Never use suicide, homicide, assault, racism, or pedophilia as the crux of a roast. These subjects are never funny.

 * Please don't use link shorteners in comments (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)

   **3 rule violations and you may face a ban**


If you see something that breaks the rules, please report them or send us a modmail.

**Highlights** is an inspiration album with the goal of inspiring comedic creativity in a set demographic. These are posted when a demographic has enough quality roasts to compile into an album. Roasters who make the list, are not awarded with flair.

[Highlights II: Dark Meat](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/4j4lm7/highlights_ii_dark_meat/)

**Best Of** is meant to showcase the best roasts based on creativity, sting, and comedic value of no specific demographic. We post these monthly, and the roasters who make the list are awarded with flair.

desabafos,9,"Quer desabafar e não tem com quem fazer isso? Quer apenas ser ouvido sem ser julgado? Quer apenas despejar tudo e ficar com o coração mais leve? Ou quer simplesmente pedir conselhos para algo que o aflija?


Comunidade para quem quer desabafar - em português. Simples assim.


_____________________________________________


**REGRA FUNDAMENTAL**: 

Seja gente boa. Seja construtivo.
Vamos fazer deste lugar um cantinho onde as pessoas podem se sentir à vontade pra falar dos seus problemas. Evite uma postura combativa. Evite dedos na cara. Evite palavras rudes. O ideal é tentar manter o clima aqui o melhor possível. :)

Pode sim dar conselhos de uma forma mais incisiva, mas lembre-se: incisivo não é ofensivo. 

**OUTRAS REGRAS E DIRETRIZES**

* O uso de contas *throwaway* e alternativas não apenas é permitido como é encorajado. Se isso for o que você considera necessário pra desabafar, vá em frente!
* Conteúdo que seja criminoso *per se* ou faça apologia a crime será imediatamente removido e o responsável suspenso ou banido dependendo da gravidade do caso. 
* Não há restrição de tema no sub. Pode ser desabafo político, pode ser desabafo de família, pode ser desabafo porque tá se sentindo gordo. Quer desabafar? Aqui é o lugar.
* Porém, não é permitido fazer ofensas ou ataques diretos e nominais a outros usuários, mesmo que seja um desabafo sobre esse usuário. Se precisar mesmo fazer esse tipo de desabafo, mantenha o foco no assunto, mencionando o usuário apenas de forma indireta, sem nomeá-lo. De qualquer forma, evite ao máximo. Picuinhas são tudo que este sub não precisa.
* Procure respeitar a [Reddiqueta](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/pt-br/reddiquette) o máximo possível.
* Existem subs com propostas semelhantes em inglês, mas a princípio NÃO é proibido postar em outras línguas. Apenas lembre-se de que o foco da comunidade é em falantes da língua portuguesa.
* Pela sua própria natureza o subreddit permite apenas submissões em formato de texto."

**Does your post qualify for /r/MildlyInteresting? Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**

-----
> ### 1. No memes 
> This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. ""banana for scale,"" ""potato quality"").

----- 

> ### 2. No related posts
> Posts that acknowledge, ""one-up,"" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. ""I see your X and raise you Y"")

-----

> ###3. No x-posts or reposts
> Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.

> **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. 

----- 

> ###4. Original [OC] photographs only
> **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  

> **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  

> **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.

> **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.

-----

> ###5. No screenshots

> No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. 

-----

> ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content
> **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  

> **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a ""spoiler"" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!

> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), ;P, 😜, ❤, ★, ✿ )

> *Still confused? For more elaboration and examples, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/) first and then [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) if you still have questions.*

#SUBREDDIT RULES

## 1: **ANIMALS IN CAPTIVITY**

No posting of zoo animals, domestic pets, animals in laboratories, circuses, hunting preserves, show business, feral cats and dogs, and alligator/crocodile wrangling. Farm animals and non-mammalian aquarium animals are allowed provided there is no human instigated feeding, baiting or violence. Anyone posting animal cruelty or organized animal fighting will be banned permanently.

## 2: **ANIMAL REMAINS**

No images of piles of feathers, bones, or blood and guts. Remains must have some metal factor to them. Uniquely bad ass skeletons and skulls may be allowed at mod discretion.

Human Remains are allowed **only** under the following conditions. Damage seen in the submission must have been caused by animals and animals only. No other forms of nature or disease are allowed. Any submission must be fully marked with both NSFW and Human Remains (NSFL) flair or the submission will be removed. Repeated violations may result in a ban.

## 3: **NSFW TAGS**

Tag bloody or gory submissions as NSFW. If a mod tags your submission NSFW do not untag it.

## 4: **HUMAN INVOLVEMENT**

Animals hurting humans is okay. Humans killing animals is not allowed. No intentional human orchestrated interaction. This also includes animals being harmed at the hands of artificial objects. Animals attacking humans on their own initiative is allowed. 

For humans being metal, check out /r/HumansAreMetal: a place for people doing badass things.

## 5: **NON ANIMAL CONTENT**

Acts of nature are allowed provided the content is metal.

## 7: **NO CLICK BAIT OR SHITPOSTS**

shittyworldproblems,6,"Welcome to Shittyworldproblems. This is not an inworld sub, it is a meta. No canon. Only cannon. Thank you.

\[RAGE](#rage) -> [RAGE](#rage)

RULES:

 1: If it's a post about themes then we love you  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1: If it's a comment about themes, ECH.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.2: If you are sharing a theme through this forum, you agree that it can apply to Frank.

 2: If it's not, but it's mocking a /r/worldproblems post, we still love you.

 3: If it's shitty enough, we'll still accept it.

 4: We accept everything.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1: We don't accept content that violates a rule below.

 5: Do not link to subreddits here. Instead, link to /u/fargoniac's post on /r/worldproblems and complain about how he's farming karma and/or self promoting.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5.1: If such a post doesn't exist, complain about fargoniac's inactivity.

Have fun you two!

#ACTUAL IMPORTANT RULES:

**A: all mashups, unless done with an actual editor, should be done with Crossfade.io**

**B: Follow the reddiquite. Trolling is sometimes okay, but don't let it get too far.**

**C: Do not reference an in world post. However, you can reference meta subs like /r/7thworldcirclejerk that do.**  
&nbsp; &nbsp; **C1: If it's a shitty or otherwise unfitting  
&nbsp; &nbsp; version of a post that doesn't exist on  
&nbsp; &nbsp; /r/worldproblems, but would fit, then  
&nbsp; &nbsp; it can act as an exception to this. Where  
&nbsp; &nbsp; /r/worldproblems can reference inworld,  
&nbsp; &nbsp; we can too.**

**D: Do not support any person's... problems. This doesn't just apply to** *him,* **I'm sure we all have our own share of faults. Try to help others if possible.**  
&nbsp; &nbsp;**D1: If that doesn't work, insult repeatedly.**

Showerthoughts,5,"## About

A subreddit for sharing those miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.

""Showerthought"" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, showerthoughts are universally relatable and find the amusing/interesting within the mundane.

Please be respectful of others' submissions. Rudeness is unacceptable. 

**Please read [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) before submitting.**

**Please read [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq) before messaging the moderators.**

## Rules  

- **1. All content must be original and unique.**    
Submissions that match (or echo similar sentiments to) ideas offered by other people will be removed, regardless of whether or not those ideas have appeared on Reddit. Blatant reposting and plagiarism may result in a ban.[»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_all_content_must_be_original_and_unique.)

- **2. All posts must be showerthoughts.**     
For an explanation of what a showerthought actually is (and is not), please read [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview).

- **3. Your entire thought must be in the title.**     
You may include examples, explanations, or further information in the body section, but all posts to /r/Showerthoughts must stand on their own as nothing but a title.

- **4. No shower ""observations.""**    
Thoughts directly related to being in the shower (or anything related to the bathroom) will be removed. [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22shower_observations..22)

- **5. No jokes, puns, wordplay, or submissions which are dependent on definitions, mechanisms, or oddities in language.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_.22wordplay.3F.22)

- **6. No ""life pro-tips"" or advice.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22life_pro-tips.22_or_advice.)

- **7. No posts about Reddit or its functions.**    
Thoughts pertaining to or mentioning Reddit are not allowed.[»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_commentaries_on_reddit_or_its_functions.)

- **8. No posts relating to politics, social justice, or religion.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_posts_relating_to_politics.2C_religion.2C_or_social_justice.)

- **9. Don't be a jerk.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_don.27t_be_a_jerk.)

> [**Please see the complete rules page for a full explanation of each of the preceding rules.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules)

> Exceedingly nonsensical or common thoughts will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, as will thoughts that are poorly written, overly vulgar, or obscene.

> **This subreddit is moderated for quality**, which means we remove content that we deem to be low-quality, low-effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. We do not ""[let the votes decide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_reddit_need_moderation.3F_can.27t_you_just_let_the_voters_decide.3F)."" We understand this type of policy is controversial and uncommon (especially for a high-traffic subreddit), but we believe it gives /r/Showerthoughts the best chance at maintaining quality.

>[Special thanks to our past moderators!](https://www.reddit.com/user/drumcowski/comments/ah3cu0/showerthoughts_mod_appreciation/)

#**No hate comments about any animals. No suggestions of violence toward animals. No breed hate. No animal cruelty. We will ban you for content such as this.**




- If you see any posts that violate any of the rules, please report the post and message the mods a link to it.

1. **Only post animals being bros. Not normal animal behavior. Animals just existing, sleeping, sitting, being petted, eating or otherwise engaging in normal animal behavior will be removed.** Do not post images with superimposed text adding context for the 'bro' action to be understood. Your post should be able to stand on its own without help from the title or additional text. 


2. Scenes set up by people to make animals look cute or helpful are staged and will be removed.

 Animals and human interactions are not necessarily bro. 

 **Animals in danger or any form of animal abuse is not tolerated.  Submissions violating this rule may be banned**


3. **Reposts will be removed.  You can check for reposts by using the search bar.  Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban.**

4. **No hate speech or racism. No personal attacks.** Dont post or promote hate speech, racism, sexism, religion-bashing, name-calling, insults, or any other abusive/threatening language. Dont post political material/circlejerking. No slap fights. ""Abusive language"" includes posts which are malicious or insulting in nature.  **Violation of this rule may result in a ban**


5. **No NSFW content is allowed.**

6. **No memes/comics. No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.**

7. **No spam.** Original content and crossposts from other subreddits are welcome, **but please no spam. This means no posts promoting a specific website, YouTube channel, blog, artwork, subreddit etc.** Spammers will be banned. No fundraising requests allowed. Do not make posts asking for donations, ie. vet bills, GoFundMe, or to sign a petition. Violations of this rule may face a ban without warning

8. **No links to social media.** No links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok.  Use direct links to post your images, videos, or gifs

9. **No comments supporting killing, eating, or harming animals.**
Threats or denigration towards any living being are not allowed and may result in a ban.  Do not joke about eating animals or share your views on eating animals.  **No breed hate**

10.  **Wrong sub/Not an animal bro**
Not all animal interactions with other animals or humans is ""bro"" or suitable for our sub.  If your submission has been removed under this rule, you can try r/aww, r/eyebleach or any other animal themed subs.  Feel free to email the mod team if you'd like to be re-directed to a community that would be a better fit


*Moderators reserve the right to remove content they deem harmful to the sub.*

#Rules & Guidelines

*Please see the* [***full list of rules & guidelines.***](http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/wiki/index) Many of the rules below have further clarification to assist you in determining why a moderator may have removed your post.

#### 1. Don't be a jerk or be deliberately unhelpful.

* This applies to everyone. Derogatory and insulting comments and posts as well as comments that are unhelpful are subject to removal.

#### 2. You must post a clear, easy to understand request for a subreddit.

* There are certain technical exceptions to this that will arise on a case-by-case basis, but if your post is asking for anything other than a subreddit or if the request is very confusing or unclear, it may be removed. 

#### 3. NSFW Posts are not allowed

* Unless you have made a request in /r/NSFW411 and they were unable to answer your question. If this is the case, please message the mods before posting your NSFW question so it may be tagged correctly and so we can manually approve it. 

#### 4. No posting of personal information

* No requests for personal information of anyone else, including name, location, and any other personally-identifiable information. If your post contains an image, this rule applies here as well.

#### 5. Do not suggest only that the user should use search engines.

* Our users are here for our help, not sarcastic responses that they should do it themselves.

* If you have nothing else to say other than to check a search engine, please refrain from commenting and leave the thread to others to assist with.

#### 6. Absolutely no joke or troll suggestions and / or posts.

* Those that suggest sarcastic, off-topic, trolling or purely incorrect subreddits to those that are genuinely seeking help, or those that make joking / trolling posts may be **temporarily banned** without warning.

* **This especially includes posts such as ""a reddit to find reddits"". You have been warned.**

#### 7. No Spam

* Spammers and clickbaiters will be swiftly removed. This includes subreddit self-promotion. This is not a place to advertise the sub you just made.

#Directory
r/FindAReddit's [directory](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/wiki/directory) indexes 1,000+ up-to-date subreddits, categorized into 50+ different categories. Large categories have their own separate subdirectories which are linked in the main directory. Our very own u/FindBot keeps each subreddit's subscriber count, activity, activity rank, and descriptions up-to-date daily.

**Moderate a subreddit with 1,000+ subscribers and want it added to the directory?**

*[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffindareddit&subject=Please%20add%20our%20subreddit%20to%20the%20directory.) and the name of the subreddit and its current subscriber count for us to consider.*

Content Philosophy
=

Content which benefits the **community** (news, rumors, and discussions) is valued over content which benefits only the **individual** (technical questions, help buying/selling, rants, etc.).  This fundamental difference in audience is why we support two communities, [r/Apple](/r/apple) and [r/AppleHelp](/r/applehelp).

 before asking ""What TV, Speakers, Subs fit blah blah"". A Sticky post may also exist helping with buying decisions. Search should be used as your query has probably come up before.

**Soundbars**

99.9% of the time **Soundbars** or HTiB (Home Theater in a Box) systems are not a good investment of your time and money. 

It is the general consensus of r/hometheater not to recommend these things and instead simply steer a user toward a 2.0 or 2.1 system made of quality, *Audio-Centric* name brand components which are easy to assemble and cheap enough for low budget or space conscious buyers. 

Most can be expanded to 5.1 if you buy the correct items in the correct order. 

For further explanation please read [Why You Shouldn't Buy a Soundbar](https://www.reddit.com/r/HTBuyingGuides/comments/dy885l/why_you_shouldnt_buy_a_soundbar/)

Please be aware /r/Soundbars exists as well as you will be met with opposition to posting about soundbars here.

**SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:**

**(1)** Questions regarding setups, equipment advice, or personal inquiries that primarily benefit the individual over the broader subreddit community should be submitted in the stickied *Weekly Questions* thread, also accessible from the *Submit a New Question* button above. Be sure to use the search bar to browse for your answer - you just may find what you're looking for!

**(2)** Photo and image posts as well as gifs and short videos must also include a 300+ character description, story, or review of their content. Posts without adequate description will be removed automatically. If your post is removed you can still add a 300+ character comment with the description and it will be approved automatically. A list of album titles is not an adequate description.

**(3)** No meme or rage comic image posts. Feel free to post them in the comments.

**(4)** Posts specifically intending to buy, sell, or trade vinyl or stereo equipment privately between collectors are not permitted. Please visit /r/vinylcollectors in order to sell, trade, and seek albums.

It is allowed to post a link to your or your label's store page if you have put out your own music on vinyl.

**(5)** Do not make a post to share download codes. These belong in /r/downloadcodes!

**Harassment Policy:** It is inevitable that users will appear from all walks and times in life, causing us to have disagreements. This can lead to constructive, unique and enjoyable content and we sincerely encourage you to share your opinions based on experience. However, harassment against other users of any kind is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. If you find yourself in a conversation that is moving toward *personal* differences and confrontation, please have the mindfulness to remove yourself from the situation. Please report harassment as such so that we can investigate.

**Spam policy:** We have a spam filter in place that flags posts from users with a very low comment karma score for manual review. If you have more than 5 comment karma you should be safe. This doesn't mean you need to have more than 5 comment karma in order to be allowed on /r/vinyl, but some posts and comments may need manual review. Please message the moderators if you think your post or comment was incorrectly flagged as spam.

**Post get removed?** [Message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvinyl) so that we can check it out for you.

**Have questions?** We'll be glad to assist you within our Weekly Questions Thread. Please ask for help by using the *Submit a New Question* button above.

> * **OW2-S1 Simple Questions Thread - 2022** [Post your Simple Questions Here!](https://redd.it/xw5qbn)

## Welcome to r/OverwatchUniversity
**r/OverwatchUniversity** is a community dedicated to helping players improve and learn by providing a place where they can share and discuss strategies or ideas, ask questions, post guides and more!


##Official Links

*[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/owu)*

## [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/about/rules) (hover for info)

###1. **Post Quality Guidelines**

* ####Low-Effort Content

* ---

* - Non-educational celebratory posts will be removed.
* - Questions that do not encourage discussion and only require a simple answer are only allowed in our **[Simple Questions Thread.](https://redd.it/ppnc6e)**
* - Vague ""How to improve"" questions are removed unless a VOD is linked or weaknesses are specified.
* * Replay codes are **NOT** a substitute for an actual VOD when it comes to receiving an effective VOD review. Please be aware of this and detail your request as much as possible still, even if you provide a replay code. Posts with only replay codes tend to receive fewer responses.
* - Simple tips must be placed inside the ""Tips and Tricks"" or ""This week I learned"" megathreads.
* - Posts that give common sense/decency advice or make social requests of the community are removed. (EG: ""Don't flame your team"", ""focus on yourself"", ""toxicity is bad"", etc)
* - Pure balance suggestion or game suggestion posts will be removed.

###2. **Irrelevant Content**

* ####Irrelevant Content

* ---

* Submissions to Overwatch University must be related to Overwatch, and be educational.

* &nbsp;

* **Examples of Irrelevant Content:**

* * Duplicate patch notes posts (We will make a thread and sticky it, or sticky the first made. All posts made after will be removed)
* * Overwatch Workshop [(here's a dedicated subreddit)](https://old.reddit.com/r/OverwatchCustomGames/) (Please note that trainer/practice codes are exempt and may be posted)
* * Memes/Image Macros
* * Rant posts, including ""sad/depressed rants""
* * NSFW content in any form
* * Interest Gauging submissions (eg ""Would people be interested in a...."" or ""Does anyone else...."")
* * Image/Video-content without a text body
* * Cheater identification reviews
* * Tech support

* ---

###3. **Community Conduct**

* ####Insulting Users

* ---

* Any form of heavily offensive language and/or inflammatory language used is prohibited. No trolling, belittling, name-calling, threats, harassment or discriminatory language. Treat others how you want to be treated.

* Don't disagree with others' opinions just because they have a lower rating than you do. /r/OverwatchUniversity is about promoting healthy discussion and extensive educational content, and offensive/discriminatory language directly harms the purpose of the subreddit. If you believe someone to be incorrect, explain how they are incorrect and provide the correct answer, politely.

###4. **Serious Replies Only** 

* ####Serious Replies Only

* ---

* Top level comments must contain serious answers, while replies to top level comments must not derail serious discussion. Any submission failing to meet these conditions will be promptly removed.

* &nbsp;

* Overwatch University is a subreddit dedicated to the educational aspects of Overwatch, we want our users to maintain focus on learning the game, rather than being distracted by memeing or being ridiculed when asking for help.

###5. **Misleading & Sensationalist Content**

* ####
Misleading & Sensationalist Content

* ---

* Sensationalist titles and non-extensive ""extensive"" guides will be removed. /r/OverwatchUniversity is an educational subreddit, and providing its userbase with clickbaiting titles is likely to directly contradict the educational value of the subreddit.

* &nbsp;

###6. **Advertisement Rule**

* ####Advertisement Rule

* ---

* We do not allow any pure advertising of any kind without prior approval from the moderators. This includes non-self promotion!

* Advertisements include, **but are not limited to:**

* * YouTube Channels
* * Discord Servers
* * Streams (linking in a comment for the purposes of providing a vod review is okay, no unsolicited linking)
* * Coaching Services (free coaching is okay in comments under vod review posts, all others - please apply for flair)
* * Team-related Advertisements (LFT, recruitment, etc)
* * **Tournaments / Competitions**
* * **Other off-site services, such as statistics sites**

* &nbsp;

* As a rule of thumb, we will generally auto-reject:

* * Pay-to-enter tournaments/leagues
* * Noneducational/casual gameplay streams, websites
* * Anything not related to Overwatch (duh)

###7. **AMA Rule**

* ####AMA Rule

* ---

* Unapproved AMA's are not allowed. In order to maintain a certain value on educational content, we're disallowing any AMA's being arranged without the advance permission of the moderator team.

* &nbsp;

* Instead of an AMA, document your thoughts into a post. A few questions we get often on AMA posts are:

* * What is your number one tip to a new player?

* * What do you think are the most important things you focused on that helped you improve?

* * How did you approach *X* or *Y* problem?

* * How do you deal with *X* champion?

* &nbsp;

* *If you believe you have a substantive AMA in hand, click the button here 
[Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/OverwatchUniversity&subject=AMA%20Request%20) and send us a request - we'll review your case.*

##Rules:  

1. You must follow [rules of reddit] (http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and the [reddiquette] (http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) on this sub.

2. NSFW posts are allowed, but more sexually suggestive content must be labeled NSFW.

3. Post any goofy, facepalm-y, blunders on social media, emails, signs, press conferences, videos, etc. , from corporations, public figures, verified Twitter accounts, or just your local PTA/HOA.  
It doesn't have to be /r/funny, and it doesn't have to be /r/rage either. Any blunders or cringey efforts to reach out to the dope and hip youngsters will do! This is a young sub and as we grow we may start enforcing submission guidelines outside of this. As of now, the subscribers will decide our front page content with their votes, and as always if you see anything that breaks reddit rules please report it.

4. If you have a screenshot involving people, we ask you to remove and edit out the names of individuals, unless they are a public entity (i.e, John Doe should be cut out, but Brad Pitt can stay)

That's all we have now, have fun!"

We're dedicated to posting images of ships of war, from the lowliest gunboat to the most glorious battleships of yore, be they from antiquity, the Age of Sail, or the modern era.

---
#Submission Rules:

####Resolution
* **Include the resolution in [brackets] in the title.** 
* Submit the highest resolution image you can! If you find a great photo, run it through Google Images or another reverse image search tool. If there is a photo with higher resolution, submit that instead! If you're posting a photo or scan of a film photo, you need to include the resolution of that digital photo or scan (all digital images have a resolution).



####Size 
* Unless it's *really* unique and you *cannot* find a larger version, please don't post photos smaller than 640x480 pixels. Postage-stamp porn was a necessity in the '90s. We can do better today!

####Sourcing 
* The original image source is *generally* preferred over any other host. 

####Exception to Sourcing Rule
* **Exceptions to the original host rule are navsource.org and ww2db.com**, which don't allow linking directly to an image. Re-upload the image to reddit, imgur, et cetera, but **please include a link to the original source in the comments**.

####Where to host images
* If you need to rehost an image, consider using Reddit's new built-in image hosting
* If you use imgur, ***ensure the link you're submitting is a direct link to the image*** and not imgur's crappy gallery page. That means make sure the link ends in an image extension like .jpg, .png, or [one of these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats). 
* ***Don't* use imageshack or photobucket**, neither of those sites are compatible with [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com ""also /r/Enhancement"") . Also, they're terrible. 

####Context 
* ***Include some context in the title*** (such as the name of the ship, war, year, or location). At the very least, the name of the ship (or the class, if the name is unknown) must be included. As long as there is some context, title jokes are fine.

####Reposts 
* Reposts are **allowed** if it's **been 3 months or longer** since the original submission.

####Crediting Creator
* If possible, give credit to the photographer, artist or institution. Do not remove watermarks from images. 
* Crediting the author is ***required*** for colorized works from irootoko_jr as well as for images from Shipbucket. Please include a link to the source in the comments as well.

####Albums 
* Albums are accepted! When posting an album, be sure to include **[Album]** in the post title instead of a resolution. Make sure you're using the correct link! For imgur albums, it must be `http://imgur.com/a/unique_code` &mdash; any other link won't work correctly with RES.

####Original Content  
* Signify your own photos with an **[OC] tag** in the title. Your post will automatically receive [OC] flair.

####Videos And Others 
* **Only submit static images or albums**. Videos, interactive images, websites, gifs/gfys, and articles **are not allowed.** Instead, post non-image content to our sister subreddit **/r/Warships.**

####Post Limit 
* Please limit your submissions to no more than **four (4) per day** so as to give other posters a chance for their content to be seen as well!

####Other Images 
* Images of models, paintings, blueprints, plans, maps, machinery, shipboard life, &c. are accepted as well, as long as it has to do with a warship.

####Artwork 
* If your image is a painting, please include [Art] in the post title. Posts which include [Art] in the title will automatically receive Art flair. Also consider crossposting it to /r/ImaginaryWarships. And before you ask, yes, paintings of real ships are allowed there.

####Comments 
* Disparaging or offensive comments may be removed and repeat offenders may be banned.

####Bots
* Most bots, such as the /u/RemindMeBot, are welcome. Some, on the other hand, are not, and **this includes the colorizing bot**. The colorizations it makes are generally poor, and someone invariably summoned the bot for *every* B&W photo that was posted. 
* If you simply *must* see a computer's attempt at colorizing an old photo, you can post the image in /r/colorizebot or /r/colorize_bw_photos, or even [PM the bot directly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=pm_me_your_bw_pics&subject=colorizebot&message=replace%20this%20text%20with%20the%20image%20URL). You can ask for a human to colorize your image at /r/colorizationrequests.

Do not contact us if you get banned or if your post gets removed. We will not respond.  Do not ask for another chance if you get banned.  Reading the [rules](https://ps.reddit.com/r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG/wiki/guidelines) was your chance. If you get muted, do not contact us again. Muting you was your answer.  Because of the nature of this sub and in consideration of its rules, some posts will be locked. Do not contact us about a locked post, especially to ask why a post gets locked. Votes determine the post outcome here. Because it does not matter what you personally think, reports on posts are auto ignored. So no report from you will be read. Mail for both mods are whitelisted, so no PM from you will be received. Inbox Replies are disabled for both mods. You can create as many alts as you want to modmail us, but you will be talking to yourself.  We put this sub on the new modmail system so all mail from you goes to the new modmail instead of the old system. We did that so we would not have to see any of your bullshit. The other mod does not have modmail access and I am currently not checking modmail in this sub. Even when I do, I promise you I will not unblock you to read your modmail.  Unless you have a shitload of karma, your message probably won't get past our mute bot anyway. *

Common questions and link reposts may be removed. We will try to let you know why if we remove a post, but it may not always happen. If we don't and you want to know, just ask. 

3.  **Please don't blogspam, advertise, or ask for crowdfunding.**  Occasional links to your blog are okay but please don't post every single time you update your blog.  That will eventually get your blog banned and we don't want to do that. All links to crowdfunding sites will be removed. When in doubt, know that the mods use [reddit's guidelines for self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as a starting point. Surveys, market research, and assignment/research study help will be removed- you can find more info about those in the sticky.

4. **Tag images of a person(s) in asana with [COMP].** If you are posting link to a picture of a person or persons in asana, in any form, you are required to tag it with [COMP] at the beginning of the submitted link's title (Check Out My Pose). Any posted photos/videos disobeying this rule will be subject to deletion. Please report violations. Self-posts with context need not be tagged, nor do full practice videos.  Any posts to personal social media accounts are subject to deletion, per Reddit's doxxing rules.  

5. **/r/yoga is NOT a medical resource.** We don't offer medical advice and we can't tell you if the pain you're feeling is a simple strained muscle or an alien life form incubating in your joint(s). By asking for advice along these lines, you assume all responsibility for the outcome should you attempt anything suggested. That being said: If you're offering advice, please do so mindfully and avoid speaking to topics you don't know about. Blatant misinformation WILL be removed. Multiple infractions may result in a ban.

Changes that introduce editorialization or rhetoric will result in the submission being removed - please express your personal opinion in the comments, not the submission title. Please use the original publisher where possible.

> **7a:** Tweets are acceptable, so long as they are from journalists, pollsters, politicians and so forth. Tweets from random members of the public are not. This is auto-moderated as per our whitelist, but tweets from non-white listed accounts may be approved depending on context and notability. 
> 
> **7b:** Twitter posts which do not contribute substance or contain reactionary commentary regardless of author will generally be removed as ""hot takes""

####Welcome to /r/EarthPorn, reddit's premiere landscape photography subreddit. 

[New to reddit? click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)

######Please post your own images here, but before you do, kindly read and adhere to the following rules:

###### **Rules:**
Submissions must be:

###### A photograph.
No Paintings, illustrations, gifs, videos, or interactive images.

###### A photograph you took (OC) 
or one which you can provide the [original source for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_this_is_my_first_time_submitting.2C_what_should_i_know.3F) Do not rehost non-OC images to reddit or imgur. Failure to provide the photographers name or the original source of the image can result in a ban. 

###### A single image
Albums may be posted in the comments.
Panoramas, Image Stacks, Composites, and images edited via Photoshop or similar software are allowed.

###### An image featuring a natural landscape
Images must have visible land. Images with humans, machines, boats, roads, airplanes, farms, animals, buildings, or other human-made objects in them [will be removed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index#wiki_what_types_of_images_are_allowed.3F)

###### An unsilhouetted image
Images where details in the landscape are not visible due to silhouetting will be removed.

###### No photos taken illegally
This includes flying your drone in a no-fly zone. Please respect local laws and access closures!


###### **Title Requirements:**
You submission title must contain the following:

###### The location of the area in the photo.
When it comes to location, the more specific the better. If you wish to not disclose the location you should at the very least name the state/country. Rule of thumb for naming only the location (e.g. a lake, mountain): if one can find the place immediately by searching it in google it's fine. For possibly ambiguous locations add state/country for safety.

###### The resolution of the image in pixel format.
For example, an image taken on an iPhone 6 would have a resolution of [3264x2448]

###### The photographers name.
If you took the photo use [OC]. OC submitters will be reward with different camera flairs based on number of OC submissions.

###### Do not include your device name in the title.
Feel free to add photography details such as camera, lens, and settings, as a comment.

###### Do not ask for upvotes in your title.
A complete list of subreddit rules are found in [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/wiki/index)

---

###### **Comment Rules:**

Hate Speech, Abusive remarks, homophobia, and the like have no place on this subreddit, and will be removed on sight.

Please contribute to the discussion positively; constructive criticism is fine, but if you don't like a picture and you wish to voice your opinion please refrain from abusing the photographer/submitter.

---

###### **Other important rules:**

EarthPorn is not a catch-all subreddit. Images that are submitted here are individually reviewed for compliance with our subreddit rules. If your submission is removed, a moderator should advise which of our network of SFWPorn subreddits would be a more appropriate place to submit.

* Do not edit, rehost or modify images submitted here without permission of the photographer. This includes edits to ""fix"" the colors of an image or remove a watermark.
* Non-OC submissions are restricted to [one per day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/2pd9kj/a_small_rule_change_for_earthporn/)**
* Regarding reposts: [Submissions are considered reposts if they have been submitted in the last 2 years or if they have received more than 20,000 karma when they were previously submitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/rkyp98/rules_update_for_2022/) 
* Circlejerky/sandbagging/pandering titles may be removed.
* If you have any questions check out the [**wiki**](/r/EarthPorn/wiki/).
* Breaking multiple rules will result in a ban.

#Rules:

##1. Submissions

* ####Guidelines:

* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology

* Self posts must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.

* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.

* ####Please do not submit the following:

* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.

* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. 

* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.

* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.

* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.

* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. 

##2. Behaviour

* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.

##3. Titles

* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:

* adequately describe the content

* adequately describe the content's relation to technology

* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. 

##4. Flair

* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).

##5. Reddit-wide rules.

* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F).

***

##Miscellanea

* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.

* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). 

* Removed posts will either be given a removal reason flair and/or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.

* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time.

CringeAnarchy,9,something_wrong_with_this_subreddit
Gifts,9,"****
Rules define a subreddit. So let's start with the 8 golden rules of this subreddit first.

**RULES:**

* Make sure to submit unique gift ideas only. If it isn't unique it does not belong here. 

*  Please flair your posts appropriately. AutoModerator already does quite a bit of automatic flairing, but it's not perfect, so please check that the flair is appropriate for your post.

* Make sure to link to the product link directly if possible. Links from trustworthy sites like Amazon, Etsy, Ebay etc are preferred. 

* Due to this subreddit getting a lot of spam, if your account is very new and/or has very little karma, your submission/comment will be removed. If your post does get removed, you can [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGifts) and, if your post isn't spam and doesn't violate any other rules, we'll approve it.

* No referral links without a warning in the comment or post title.

* No ad hominem attacks or threats, including troll-feeding responses.

* If you believe a post or comment is spam, breaks our rules, breaks reddit's rules, or is otherwise inappropriate, **please** click the ""report"" button and submit a report (with a reason, please).

* If over 10% of your submissions and conversation are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer. [[1](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)] [[2](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion)] [[3](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204536499-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-)]

And that's it for now. More rules may be added here as the community grows depending on what you guys think is important. But the most important thing is to keep submitting unique gift ideas here and stay awesome. 

****
**How to tell whether the gift is unique?**

I would say that if you think that the gift you found out is unique, it most probably is unique. If you submit it here, you'll find out.
****
**Self posts asking for gift ideas are also allowed here.** 

Just mention ""Looking for a gift for my 'xyz'"" in the title and mention the things he/she likes the most plus other details like the occasion and/or budget in the description. We could have a discussion about it and find the most suitable and cutest gift for that 'xyz' of yours :)

We all love gifts, don't we?? :)
****
Please [**send us a modmail**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGifts) if your post gets stuck in the spamfilter. We receive at least 20+ spam posts everyday and it's hard to go through each submission.

Unexpected,4,"[Join Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/J5BnS6h)

Titles should not include ""unexpected, expected, expects, expect"" 

 2. Do NOT rehost webcomics. You may provide an imgur mirror in the comments.
 3. Mark all NSFW/NSFL submissions as such. **A warning tag on a post may mean NSFL, morbid content, gore, cruelty, etc. -

> **Posting Rules**
---
 ---
*Remember: the rules change on weekends! See 'The /r/trees Weekend' below.*
 ---
1. **No Black Market Sourcing:** Do not offer, or ask for, recommendations on: where or how, on the black market, to acquire cannabis or anything derived from it (extracts, edibles, seeds, THC, CBD, etc.) freely exchanged or otherwise; or on how to smuggle, transport, ship, mail, or otherwise travel with cannabis or its derivatives. Do not make any posts involving meetups or other location-specific topics.
2. **No personal attacks:** Be respectful to fellow posters – name-calling, rudeness, slurs, vulgarities towards other users, and trolling are not welcome here.
3. **No minors:** /r/trees is strictly 18+ only, no exceptions (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_.2Fr.2Ftrees_18.2B.3F) for more information on why). You might be interested in /r/saplings instead, where Redditors under 18 can ask questions about cannabis and its effects.
4. **No advertising:** All forms of advertising and self-promotion are strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, posts promoting specific products or name brands, promoting YouTube channels or other forms of Social Media, and linking to online stores or other places designed to make money. Learn more about self-promotion on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).   Learn more about [spam](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-spam-am-i-spammer) on Reddit.
5. **No low-quality link posts outside of Saturday:** This includes memes, image macros, screenshots, simple trees references (such as pineapples and “420”), posts  about broken glassware and spilled bowls, and all posts not directly about cannabis (besides the title). Those are allowed on “Slack-Post Saturday” every week, but you can make all those posts at /r/see during the week instead. See the [visual posting guide](http://imgur.com/a/1WL7J) showing types of disallowed posts.
6. **No NSFW/Porn:** Do not post nudity or any sort of explicit porn. 
7. **No reposts:** For links, this involves any picture posted in the previous 6 months. For text posts, this involves asking any commonly asked questions on /r/trees (including questions about drug testing). For those, use the search bar and our [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq).
8. **No posts that harm the community:** Do not post pictures of tagging/vandalism, encourage driving while high (including pictures where you are obviously driving while high), post about sneaking weed past TSA, or make other posts harmful to the trees community.
9. **No posts promoting political candidates:** Posts that endorse a political candidate, regardless of the connection to cannabis, are disallowed.  
10. **No posts involving a personal loss:** Those should be kept to the ""Monday Mourning"" thread each week.

The /r/trees mod team reserves the right to remove any other posts at our discretion. You can [contact the mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftrees) with any questions.

---
#### [](#h4-green)  
> **The /r/Trees Weekend**
---
 ---
####SLACK-POST SATURDAY
 ---
* Every **Saturday**, *we relax our rules*. Artwork, GIFs, and image macros are all permitted for the day.
* Not everything goes though: you still **can't** upload NSFW, ask for hookups/meetups, show disrespect towards other users or advertise anything *at all*. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2hhh5t/introducing_slack_post_saturday_bringing_back/).
> 
---
####SELF-POST SUNDAY
 ---
* Every **Sunday**, *you can submit text posts only.*
* This allows for a break from all of the link posts during the week, so the community can share their stories and talk with each other. Naturally, we are less strict regarding the removal of text posts.

RTLSDR,4,"**Link / Image posts are now sent to the Mod Queue before appearing.**  Use self / text posts for your immediate inquiries and general posts.

A subreddit for the low-cost, DIY software defined radio (SDR) community. While originally dedicated just to the [rtl-sdr](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) project, relevant legal content related to general SDR, RF and similar projects  is also welcomed.

Feel free to ask questions but please [check the wiki first](https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/wiki/).

# rtl-sdr

""rtl-sdr"" is a generic term for cheap USB digital TV (DVB-T) receivers that use the Realtek **RTL2832U** chipset, which can function as general purpose software defined radios (receive only). All rtl-sdr compatible devices employ the RTL2832U as an ADC and USB controller, but different RF tuners may be used. 
Note that **rtl-sdrs do not transmit!**  

Typical specs (some depend on specific tuner):

* Cost: ~$5-45 USD
* Frequency range : 24 - >1760 MHz (100 KHz - 24 MHz in direct sampling mode)
* Max sample rate: 3.2 MS/s (2.6 MS/s in practice)
* Resolution: 8 bits/sample
* Noise figure: < 4.5 dB 
 
#Resources - Please read this first - before posting!

* [The rtl-sdr project page](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) Source of the rtl-sdr driver software and hub for its continued development. (osmocom.org)

* See our [wiki with tutorials and other resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/wiki) including a [Quick Start page](http://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/wiki/no_reception_quickstart) to verify your dongle works. 

* Here is a great, broadband [Planar Disk Antenna](http://www.wa5vjb.com/references/PlanarDiskAntennas.pdf) that outperforms most commercial antennas of similar size for under $65-75 and can be built in a half hour or less by beginners with less than $10 in parts. Please verify your dongle is working with a good antenna before complaining that you cannot receive something. Just because an antenna ""is sold"" does not mean its good or even marginal. In contrast, the Planar Disk is almost free and it performs quite well in an indoor setting.

#Rules/Guidelines:
for the nuances of these rules, please read the [expanded ruleset](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules)

###Remember - all judgment is left at moderator discretion.

* Do not post, link to, or ask for personal information
* No trolling, hate speech, or using slurs
* Do not insult other users, flamewar, or flame bait
* Do not /u/ summon users from linked threads
* Do not vote or comment in linked threads 
* Novelty accounts are not welcome in /r/SubredditDrama
* Off-topic grandstanding will be removed
* No post history stalking
* We enforce the spirit of the rules, not the letter
* New accounts get no leeway and will be banned without warning for violating any of our rules

###When in doubt about a rule, please read the rules wiki, or message us for clarification.

Users who break rules may receive a warning via PM or a distinguished comment. You may be warned for rule offenses instead of banned, but certain offenses are ban-on-sight, and **all bans are up to the mod's discretion.**

#Linking

The golden rule of submitting drama is: **Don't bore us.**

If a post doesn't fit these rules, if it's entertaining as fuck submit it anyway and we'll look at it to make an exception. If you're not sure, you can always contact us via modmail.


* **Avoid bias and do not submit drama you are directly involved in.** Remain as neutral as possible; biased titles/self posts are grounds for deletion.
* **SRD is not a call-out subreddit.** If your post points out bad behavior more than it does drama, it will be removed. 
* **Do not make us hunt for the drama.** When submitting drama do not link to the full comments, to images, or otherwise to outside of a comment thread. Links to full threads are allowed where the drama is obvious, but use common sense and direct links when applicable. Use ?context when appropriate. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_submitting_self_posts_and_write-ups) for more information.

#Surplus Popcorn

This is the current list of drama that has a higher bar for submission.

* Partisan pissmatch
* Gun drama
* Gender wars
* Racism drama
* Social Justice drama

If you're going to submit drama for these topics, make sure it's quality! See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/wiki/rules#wiki_surplus_popcorn) for more information.

There are some rules though:


**ALL FORMS HATE SPEECH WILL BE REMOVED BY THE MODS. BANS WILL BE ISSUED.**

#**We are no longer accepting content from Nick Adams**


#**We do not accept any content about Kyle Rittenhouse.**



#Rules:



* **Rule 1:**  **Do not link source material. Ever. We will ban you if you do**
This includes asking for personal info, suggesting, implying or promoting  any kind of witchhunting at all. Don't do it. Public figures are exempt (this includes twitter users with blue checkmarks). 

* **Rule 2:**  Don't be an asshole. No hate speech, bigotry or personal attacks. Misogyny is considered hate speech. Transphobia and homophobia will result in bans. **THIS IS A PRO-CHOICE SUBREDDIT. Anti-abortion comments and submissions will result in a permanent ban.**


* **Rule 3:**  Don't post personal information. Please remove any details that could be used to locate the subject(s) of a post. This includes **faces**, usernames, subreddit names, real names, phone numbers, license plate numbers, physical addresses, or any other contact information.

* **Rule 4:**  **No memes without accompanying commentary, image macros, or private messages** - screenshots of social media comments only.

* **Rule 5:**  Avoid reposting or flooding. **Repost farmers will be banned**.  Do not make posts that others have posted before, or post more than 3 posts in a 24 hour timeframe. 

* **Rule 6:**  **No insanity in the comment section.** This is a place to laugh at crazy people on social media. It is not a place to be one of these crazy people. Please don't start agreeing with crazy people. 

* **Rule 7:** Moderators have the final word when it comes to making decisions they deem to be in the best interest of the subreddit.  Do not privately message moderators about moderation issues.

ladybonersgw,7,"Welcome to Ladyboners Gone Wild.             
This is a place for guys on reddit to strut their stuff.             
We here are more about men as a whole, not just headless torsos and bodiless cocks.             
More gentle, kind and dude-appreciative than /r/GoneWild, more accepting of self-posts and NSFW than the original LadyBoners. However, NSFW is not a requirement!            
             
*****************
             
We have had all types of Male posters over the years, Aces, Bisexuals, Straights, Gays, Pansexuals, and F2M Transexuals.
        
All men and body types are welcome here. 

************

**[CLICK HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/ladybonersgw/comments/ywivq/important_mod_post_please_read_and_upvote) TO READ AN IMPORTANT MOD POST!**

[Click here](http://imgur.com/removalrequest) for the Imgur image deletion request form.  
If you need further help, especially with DMCAs, please message the moderators.
             
*****************

**Rules:**

**#1: Age - YOU MUST BE 18+ TO POST.**



**#2: Show a clear amount of Face:**

All posts must contain one photo that shows at least around 2/3's of your face.

We expect 2 of the following 3 facial features: full mouth, full nose, and full eyes. or if a profile shot, it must be a clear profile shot of the full half of your face.

The tip of your nose, or a single nostril, or the shadow of your nose, is not your full nose nor is it even half.

Videos and gifs must include at minimum approx 2 - 3 seconds of qualifying face visibility.

TEXT Only Posts are NOT ALLOWED.

Also, please make it clear. Some shadows are OK but not darkness that deliberately obscures your face, shower steam, pixilation, stickers, face-altering filters that hide more than one feature or any other thing that makes your features unintelligible or unnatural.

For posts where you want to feature a picture that does not meet Rule #2, make an album with at least one photo that does meet the rule.

Other angles may be approved at a mod’s discretion (but don’t count on it), and yes, you can show us your eyes, and mouth with only your nose missing.

**#3: Subject - Pictures must contain only men and must only contain the poster.**            
This means that no one can post on your behalf.              
This also means that we do not allow joint accounts to post here under any circumstances.              

**#4: Absolutely and Positively NO GENITAL CLOSE-UPS.**
Don't put your junk right up in the lens. Whether it's in the title post, an album, a video, or posted into the comments, that specific post/comment/video will be removed with EXTREME PREJUDICE.             
Your dick should not be the main focus of your post, if you could hide your facial features with your dick, it's too close. It should never be the closest thing to the camera.

**#5: No Reposts - No reposts.**
Just Don't! Please Keep it fresh. (A repost is any content that has already appeared on our sub, not content posted to other subs.)

**#6: Be Respectful - Be nice!**
Rude, demeaning, or insulting comments will be removed, and repeat offenses may result in a ban.             
You may not be issued a warning if the offense is judged to be bad enough for an instant ban.

**#7: Crossposts - DO NOT CROSS-POST FROM /R/LADYBONERS.**
Properly title your crossposts!

**S: No soliciting**
We do not allow any reference to any other social media site (kik, onlyfans. snapchat, etc.). All posts containing such references are removed.

**X: No Karmawhoring**

DO NOT USE SELF DEPRECATING/FISHING/NEGGING WORDS/PHRASES IN YOUR TITLE!             
Do Not Beg, Bargain, or Blackmail for Karma.

* Please report and/or message the moderators if you see a post that is in violation of the above rules.

* If you want all out cock pics, feel free to browse the [m] section of:             
[/r/gonewild](/r/gonewild)            
[/r/mangonewild](/r/mangonewild)            
or             
[/r/penis](/r/penis).*             
**For those uncomfortable with showing your face in a post, please post in the previously mentioned subreddits.             
This place is distinct from those and our moderators take the rules VERY seriously.**

**Optional verification:** Verify yourself to receive flair text of your choosing; the post must contain:

* A minimum of three pictures of you, from different angles;  
* Holding a clear, *handwritten* sign containing your username, the date of posting and a shout out to /r/ladybonersgw;  
* Not breaking any of the above rules for the subreddit;  
* Put the word ""verify""/""verification"" in the title for the mods.

A moderator will come around and ask you what you want to have for your flair text - you can choose anything!  
**We may ask for age verification - this will be mandatory or a ban will follow. Users whose age has been checked will have an ""18+"" flair next to their name.**
*Optional verification becomes mandatory if you are asked to do so by the moderators.*

####Guidelines

[/r/Music Posting Rules](http://goo.gl/i8Enkc)

######[](#list)
1. **No music from the [Hall of Fame](http://goo.gl/h1aUhL)**

2. **No images**    
    Instead post to [one of these subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/music/wiki/musicsubreddits#wiki_images).    

3. **Artist - Title [Genre]** *Optional text*   
    All submissions of streaming songs and albums must follow this format or will be removed.    
    Optional additional text may only be included after this part of the title. No ALL CAPS.

4. **No artist reposts for 30 days if the previous post broke 100 points**

5. **No clickbait titles or asking for votes**    
    Music should stand on its own. If you have an interesting story behind the music, you can add this in the comments or as self-post text.

6.  **Fridays are text post only**    
    Friday is for interesting discussions, not streaming music. If your post is ""low effort"" or looks like just another way of posting streaming music, then it will be removed. Bad discussion posts are subject to removal on **any day**.   

7. **Saturdays are for fresh and original music**    
    Dedicated to underground artists, your original compositions, and new releases by known artists. Well known tracks will be removed at mod discretion.     
    **Submitters**: For original music, use the ""*I Made This*"" flair. For new releases, use ""*New Release*"". You can select your flair beneath your link after posting.

8. **No /r/ifyoulikeblank, /r/tipofmytongue, or request-style posts**    
    For recommendations of new artists similar to those you already like, use /r/ifyoulikeblank. For help with identifying a song, use /r/tipofmytongue or /r/namethatsong. 

9. **Must link to official artist channels**    
    Exceptions are made for exclusive releases or tracks not available on an artist's official channel. 

10. **No crowd funding sites**

11. **No links to unauthorized music leaks or promotion of piracy**  

12. **Discussions and Articles should be directly relevant to music, music technology, or the music business itself**  
    Articles / Tweets discussing statements by musicians not relevant to their work are not allowed. Articles discussing events in musician's lives are subject to mod discretion.

13. **Follow [reddiquette](http://goo.gl/JJjqHU) at all times.**

#**About Us**

Netflix is the world's leading internet entertainment service with over 148 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments.

#**What We Aren't**

r/Netflix is NOT affiliated with Netflix corp in any way, shape or form.  Any issues with Netflix (content and/or functionality) should be addressed directly with Netflix customer service.  Threads that fall under content/functionality are subject to removal at moderator discretion.

#**Rules and Guidelines**

###Limit threads suggesting changes to Netflix. 

Please contact Netflix directly. This subreddit is not owned or moderated by Netflix or any of their employees. A ""what about"" thread is fine. ""Hey Netflix, you need to do this"" thread is heard by nobody that can change it. 

###No threads about Netflix not making some netflix originals.

We all know that. It's a marketing term. Netflix uses the term “original” to delineate between movies and series that are exclusive to its platform, and those that are aggregated from other studios after first being made available elsewhere.

###Please don't ask if you can buy or share an account.

This will get you permanently banned. 
You're warned. No, we won't even bother to discuss this with you. You will be banned forever. 

###No VPN & Proxy discussion. 

Post that in [/r/NetflixByProxy](https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixByProxy)

###No blogspam reviews or spamming about your app or webpage. 

Please report infractions. Please contact us first if you have a question about your app/page.

###MAKE A SELF POST

And not a screen grab to suggest a movie or link to the movie on the Netflix site.

###Flair your thread with your country if the issue/question is specific to programming in your country. 

If your thread applies to every Netflix country, use ALL. (This makes it easier to skim the page and power users can search by tag to find relevant threads.)

#**Comment Spoilers**

To make a spoiler **comment** only use:

`>!Spoiler Text!<`

Add the scope of the spoiler in the brackets. For example:

 >!Spoiler Text!<

To view the spoiler, simply hover your cursor over the text.

Failure to mark spoilers, or intentionally posting spoilers will get you banned.

#**Netflix Tools**

exchristian,6,"##**Welcome to /r/exchristian!**

We are a supportive community for ex-Christians or those who are questioning their religion. Please feel free to share your thoughts and stories, vent feelings, or just have a casual chat.
We also have a [Discord server!](https://discord.gg/xHRvEVc)

### Are you looking for help? Try our new [Resource wiki page!](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/resources)

#### We have a FAQ! [Please read it before posting or commenting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/faq)

##[**Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/rules)
##1. Your post should be relevant.
 - Posts should be related to ex-Christianity, and/or the ex-Christian experience.

##2. No spam posts.
- Advertising, irrelevant posts, and spam are not allowed and are subject to removal.
 - All self-promotion must be run by the mods first. This includes surveys, videos and other content associated with the poster.  
 - [Read our detailed rules on submitting surveys before submitting them to our subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/surveys) Surveys posted without pre-approval will be removed.

##3. No preaching, proselytizing, apologetics, or provoking.
 - This is not a debate sub. Differences of opinion are fine, arguing over which opinion is (or should be correct) is not. It's important to agree to disagree.
 - Non-Christian opinions and beliefs are welcomed and encouraged. However, do not try pushing your belief system onto others, Christian, ex-Christian, or otherwise.  
- Christians are welcome here only so long as they're looking to learn or seek help. Christians defending Christianity or arguing for their personal interpretations of Christianity (apologetics) will be removed.

##4. Be respectful.
 - Mind the community that you are in. Many people here are victims of traumatic experiences.
 - Though profane language is permitted, rude behaviour towards each other in this sub is not.
 - **This is not a debate sub.** Arguments may be shut down without notice.
 - Remember [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

##5. No low effort posts.
- [Meme (image macro) posts during weekdays.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/rules#wiki_meme_.28image_macro.29_posts_during_weekdays.)
- [Respect the time and effort of the community responding to you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/rules#wiki_respect_the_time_and_effort_of_the_community_responding_to_you.)

##6. No cross-posting from religious subreddits
-  In order to prevent brigading, you cannot cross-post from a religious sub (r/Christianity, r/Catholic, r/Mormon, etc) to here. You can take a screen shot of a post and post the image but the user's name, subreddit, and other identifying info must be censored.

##7. No personally identifying information.
 - Facebook profiles, reddit usernames, full real names, phone numbers, credit card info, etc. *must* be censored.

## 8. Do not contact moderators directly about subreddit-related issues.
 - *All contact to the mods about /r/exchristian-related concerns must be to sent to the subreddit mod mail. Any and all direct messages and chats to the mods inquiring about subreddit issues will be ignored and deleted.*
 - Moderation reserves the right to mute or ban users they deem a disruption to the community as they see fit.

##[**Full rules here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/wiki/rules)

#If you see a disrespectful user, do not engage; report it to the mods, and move on.

*Warnings will be given to offenders at the discretion of the moderators. Repeat offenders will be banned from this subreddit.*

MTB,3,"**We are a cycling community enthusiastic about mountain biking and all things related.**

Please follow proper [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), and if you haven't already, take a moment to [read our wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/wiki/index) and learn a bit about the [site's history](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5U-NCG1zZds).

Remember to vote based on quality, not opinion, and keep your submission titles factual and opinion-free. Do *not* downvote opinions just because you disagree with them.

On the other hand, be generous with upvotes. They are free, after all.

If you think your post was removed by mistake, use the [*message the moderators*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMTB) link in the sidebar and include a link to your post. (Otherwise we'll ignore it. We are busy, after all.)

***
**Be cool to each other!** 

We're all here because we love cycling.

**Need help choosing a bike?** 

If you need help choosing a bike, please be sure to tag your post with the WhichBike flair, and include some basic information, like your price range and the type of riding you'll be doing.

**Photos should be of people riding mountain bikes.** 

The general rule is photo and video submissions to /r/mtb should be of people riding mountain bikes. If you want to submit a trail or bike photo instead – your new bike leaning against a tree, or the view from top of the trail, for example – add it to the Weekly Gear Gallery Thread.

**No fundraising, karma-baiting or cryptic post titles.**

**No image macros, Rage Comics, or memes.**

**New to mountain biking?**

If you need help choosing a bike, check out [u/Bmied31](https://reddit.com/u/Bmied31)'s absolutely amazing [Mountain Bike Buying Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/9hqf5r/firstbudget_mountain_bike_buying_guide/), as well as his equally amazing [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/eo9pri/mountain_bike_faq_guide_to_common_mountain_biking/).

curlyhair,5,"#Welcome!
>Post your curly haired questions or awesome curly haired do's! This subreddit is dedicated to any and all with *naturally* wavy, curly, coily, or kinky locks. 

-
#**Read the sidebar - lots of questions can be answered here!**
-

# Rules 

1. **Provide your routine!**
    1. *Photo posts:* you must include: current routine, products you use, and how you apply them, or your post will be removed. 
    + *Help posts:* help us help you by providing lots of info & by [reading the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/wiki/index) first.
    + *Other posts*: (memes, products, etc.) set the flair appropriately so your post stays up. ([instructions here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1uq68v/how_to_flair_your_post/))

2. **Do not self-promote** Do not link your own content, including your blog, youtube, survey, website, instagram, or store. Posting this content will result in a ban. Instagram handles are OK, but not links, and only in comments, not titles. (May only be shared once per thread, use a 1:10 content ratio.) Surveys should also be cleared with the moderators before being shared on the sub. If the youtube video you are posting is your own content or on your own channel, you may not post it here.

3. **Keep posts and comments related to curly hair** We are here to embrace, nourish, and love our wavy, curly, coily, kinky hair. Keep posts and comments related to curly hair. Off topic comments and posts related to straightening hair may be removed.

4. **Practice good [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** 
Keep it PG. Nearly all posts & photos in this subreddit are original content, meaning there is a real person behind each post who deserves to be treated with respect. Use the report button if you see anything inappropriate and feel free to message the mods. It's anonymous!

5.  **No sexual/creepy/harassing comments** Keep it PG. Nearly all posts & photos in this subreddit are original content, meaning there is a real person behind each post who deserves to be treated with respect.

6. **Include everybody.** Anyone with any amount of texture in their hair is welcome here. Passing judgment on whether someone else’s hair is “curly enough” is neither useful nor productive for our common goal of bringing out the best in our hair. Please also remember that terms like “afro” and “big chop” have a long and complex history within the natural hair movement for black women (see wiki). To keep our community welcoming, it’s important that we respect these words and use them appropriately.

7. **Do not privately message users of this subreddit.** Reminder: this is a SFW subreddit. Do not privately message users, especially with ""compliments"" (those can be shared publicly) or sexual requests. If you wish to contact someone via PM, ask them in public chat first. They do not need to answer you.

8. **Respect cultural terms** The natural hair movement has a long history and the words created in it have meanings. It’s important to respect where these words, techniques, and more came from, and celebrate the importance of the work done by these early pioneers. Please be aware of terms such as “big chop”, “afro”, “natural hair journey”. Be thoughtful and respectful about using these powerful terms appropriately!

######

**/r/OutOfTheLoop** —
Have you ever seen a whole bunch of news stories/reddit posts/videos or anything else about some topic and you had no idea what everyone was going on about? Did you feel *out of the loop*? This subreddit is dedicated to helping you get up to speed with the recent trends and news.

####Rules
#1. Post title must be a current, unbiased, and coherent question
- The title is the most important aspect of creating a post. If it's hard for other users to understand what you are asking then it will be hard to get an answer. 
 - **Current** - The topic of the post you are creating must be a trending event that has happened recently.
 - **Unbiased** - Don't put your own twist on it to make it come off negative or positive. Try to be as neutral as possible. 
 - **Coherent** - Write a complete question that is clear about what you are trying to ask. Don't simply put one word and a question mark. 
 - **Format** - **[Include the format listed here.](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/titles)**


#2. Post must include context and resources in the body of the text
- Context is key when trying to find a proper answer. The more we know about what you are asking, the better we can answer with more information. 
 - **Context** - Add some words to your post so there is more to work with than a title. Words such as; what you saw, where you saw it, how often you saw it. 
 - **Resources** - You obviously saw it somewhere; link to the thing that made you ask. Or include a screenshot.  


#3. No ad nauseam, recently reposted, or retired questions
- Often times what you are asking has already been answered. Be sure to search the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/search), [Google](https://www.google.com/), and [KnowYourMeme](http://knowyourmeme.com/) before creating a new post.
 - **Ad nauseam** - The topic in question has been discussed extensively, and that those involved in the discussion have grown tired of it.
 - **Recently reposted** - A topic is popular and is posted multiple times within a short period of time.
 - **Retired** - The '[Big List of Retired Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions)' is a wiki page created by the mods that lists overly asked questions that have been thoroughly answered. Duplicates of retired questions may be removed.

#4. Top-level comments must begin with ""Answer:"", and be a genuine, unbiased, and coherent answer
- People are here to find answers to their questions. If top-level comments are riddled with memes or non-answers then no one wins. 
 - **Begin with ""Answer:""** - This helps weed out low-effort, rule-breaking comments, as well as allows the comments to be more organized.
 - **Genuine** - Attempt to answer with words; don't pop in to tell users to search or drop a link without explanation.
 - **Unbiased** - Answer without putting your own twist of bias towards the answer. However, after you leave an unbiased response, you can add your own opinion as long as it's clearly marked, starting with ""Biased:"".
 - **Coherent** - Write in complete sentences that are clear about what you are trying to say.

#5. Be nice, follow etiquette
- This subreddit is supposed to be a helpful place for confused redditors.
 - **Be nice** - Be polite in your exchanges, vote based on whether a comment contributes to the discussion and not on whether you agree with the opinion, etc.
 - **Follow etiquette** - When in doubt, refer to [**reddiquette**](http://www.reddit.com/w/reddiquette/).

#Rules and Guidelines  

##SUBMISSIONS      

***hover for details***

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1) Content must actually make you rage. |No rage comics, memes, or obnoxious like/share stuff. No pics of bad parking jobs. No screenshots of computer problems. Nothing that mildly annoys you. Nothing that physically disgusts you (no NSFL content). This is not /r/mildlyinfuriating, /r/firstworldproblems, /r/terriblefacebookmemes, or /r/wtf. If your post fits in any of those subs, it doesn't belong here. |  
|2) **Do not post any identifiable information.** Block out all names & usernames from your post. | This includes Facebook profiles, Twitter accounts, Instagram accounts, Deviant Art accounts, Reddit accounts, etc. Failure to do so **will result in a ban.** |  
|3) Social media screenshots and videos must be of **notable public figures**: Politicians, celebrities, online personalities, etc.| Exceptions: 1) If your post has been shared by a substantial number of people (eg. 1000+ re-tweets/likes/upvotes) then it will be allowed. 2) If your post features a large collection of individual comments all featuring a similar viewpoint (eg. 30 comments all saying the Paris attacks were a false-flag) then it will be allowed. |
|4) No **manufacturing outrage.**| Do not present opposing articles or pieces of information to show some sort of contrast. Do not include things such as ""imagine if the gender/race were reversed!"" If the content does not stand on its own, it does not belong. |
|5) If posting an **article or video**, your title must **match the original title** (or provide an accurate description, for video).| Editorializing content is not allowed and will result in the removal of your submission. This includes if you post a screencap of an article. |
|6) This is not your personal soapbox. Posts promoting an agenda will be removed.| We are not your personal army, nor are we interested in your ideology. If it's clear your interests in posting here involve drumming up support or outrage, your post will be removed regardless if it meets the other requirements. |
|7) Links to reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Deviantart, Instagram, Soundcloud, Vocaroo, etc are **not** allowed.| These links often contain personally identifiable information. If possible, take a screenshot of the content, **censor any names/usernames/identifying information,** and then post it. |
|8) Content focusing on the actions of the mentally ill or disabled people is not permitted **and you will be banned.** | This is common human decency. |
|9) Images must be directly linked and hosted on a reliable host. | URL needs to end in .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. |
|10) No mobile links. | Delete the ""m."" or ""mobile."" in the link before you submit.
|11) All posts must be from recent news | We are not interested in rage bait that happened last year.  If your content isn't from the past month or so, don't post it

----- 

##COMMENTS

***hover for details***

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1) DO NOT ENGAGE IN WITCH-HUNTING. | Any ""calls to arm"" against any person, online user, company, etc. are NOT allowed. We are not your personal army. Anything hinting at this will be removed and the users banned. |
|2) Posting **personally identifiable information** of any kind is **NOT** permitted.| This includes real names **and** usernames.
|3) No fighting words. Keep it civil. | Flamewars, drama, excessive hostility, hate speech and insults **are not permitted.** If you see any of these, please [report them.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/rage)|
|4) Do not post the **original source** when a Reddit comment, Facebook post, Twitter post, etc. are posted here.| Doing so **WILL** result in a ban.|

##OTHER

|We do not track ""offenses."" | This means that any violation of our rules may result in a ban, even if it's your first offense.
|Please downvote and report submissions that clearly don't belong in this subreddit.|Use the sidebar as a guideline for what content is or isn't allowed. If a submission clearly breaks the rules, **[report it](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/rage)** so we can take care of it.|

socialism,10,"#Welcome to /r/Socialism


**Socialism as a political system** is defined by democratic and social control of the means of production by the workers for the good of the community rather than capitalist profit, based fundamentally on the abolition of private property relations.

**Socialism is also a sociopolitical movement** dedicated to the critique and dismantling of exploitative structures, including economic, gendered, ethnic oppression.

Socialism, as a movement, confronts these different systems of oppression as mutually conditioning, intersectional, and/or dialectically related within the current hegemonic order. It seeks to overcome oppression in a holistic manner without neglecting any particular axis so that it might be eliminated and genuine social emancipation may be realized. We recognize that Socialism cannot be achieved while structural oppression continues and workers are divided.

We look forward to your participation in our sub, but please be mindful of our posting guidelines. 

Are you new to socialist ideas? Wondering what alternatives to capitalism exist? Please check out our educational materials and wiki further down in this sidebar.

ProRevenge,6,"Have a story of you or someone you know getting back at someone with pro revenge after being wronged? Post it here! 

**Rules:**

1. Your story should be about getting back at someone who wronged you in generally an interesting and/or funny way. In order for your story to be pro revenge, it should involve you going out of your way and going above and beyond to get revenge. If that isn't the case with your story, it may be better suited for another revenge subreddit such as /r/pettyrevenge or /r/maliciouscompliance.
 * Only revenge stories are allowed. If you have an idea for the subreddit, please message the mods to submit your suggestions. Meta posts may be allowed, but need to be cleared by the mods before posting.  
 * Not sure if your story is pro or not?  See [What is Pro Revenge?](https://reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/wiki/whatisprorevenge)

2. The story does not have to be about you; it can be about someone you know or even something you saw somewhere else. However, stories must be feasibly possible. If the mods deem your post to be clearly fictional, it may be removed.

3. No posts asking for ideas of revenge; all posts should contain a full revenge story. Update posts are only allowed if they include significant additional revenge; minor updates should go in the original post or a comment linked from original post. Moderators reserve the right to remove update posts if they are deemed excessive/not relevant.  

4. Do not post any personal information, real or fake, such as full names, phone numbers, addresses, facebook/twitter pages or email addresses etc. Posting personal information will result in an immediate ban.

5. Cross posts (x-posts) are welcome but please copy the text here, instead of providing a link. You may link to videos but your post will still need to describe the revenge (i.e. you can't just post the video link and nothing else).

6. Please, nothing too serious. No felonies or other nonacceptable/illegal stories. 

7. Bots and bot-like behavior are not allowed. 

8. Please be considerate in your posts and comments. No racism, sexism, personal attacks against other redditors etc. The mods may remove distasteful comments.

9. This sub is not your personal army. Do not attempt to use this sub to gang up on or promote a person, cause, or group.

10. Do not post comments calling stories fake without backing up your claims. You are more than welcome to point out inconsistencies or express your skepticism, but simply saying 'It didn't happen', 'fake', 'that happened', and the like do not contribute to the sub and create a toxic atmosphere.  

11. No acronyms or initials for names. Please assign your story characters fake names (first name only per Rule 4) or use titles like 'EntitledIdiot'.

The mods reserve the right to remove content at their discretion.

If you have any questions please feel free to message the mods.

thatHappened? Really? She walked off the bus and they all clapped? Sure.  

This subreddit is for true stories that absolutely happened. No diggity. Like that one time...

---

#**Rules**

|||
|:--|:--|
|**1: Post incredibly true stories that totally actually happened.** If your story is obviously true, verifiable, or satire, it will be removed. This is a satire subreddit for fleshed out stories, not texts and one-liners. Stories have a beginning, middle, and end.
|**2: Redact any information that can be used to identify a source in your post.  This includes subreddit names, usernames, and unique profile pictures. Verified twitter usernames are exempt. No kid's faces, period.**
|**3: No linking to on-site or off-site content! Properly anonymized screenshots and short videos only!**
|**4: Don't make an attempt to find, contact, or help other people find or contact people featured in these posts. Online or IRL.** Do not brigade other threads, on or off of reddit. Do not doxx someone featured in a post. You will be permanently banned and reported to the admins.
|**5: No Reposts** This subreddit has a long memory and and reposts will be reported and removed. Please check new and hot to make sure your post is not currently visible on the sub.
|**6:** If you need to appeal anything, please make the message subject ""Einstein?"" in your appeal as evidence that you've read the rules all the way to the end!
|**7: All COVID and masking posts are now banned** To prevent the spread of COVID misinformation, we are no longer allowing any posts relating to COVID, COVID vaccines, or masks (both anti- and pro-). COVID posting belongs in /r/vaxxhappened. 

  


**Moderators reserve the right to remove or approve posts at their discretion**. (We're only human, like you. If you think there's an issue, feel free to message modmail.)

#Reddiquette will be brutally enforced. No hate speech.  Be civil in the comment section.

fusion,1,"**Nuclear Fusion on Reddit**

Focused on advancements in the field of nuclear fusion.

Submissions should be related to nuclear fusion or plasma physics *as currently understood by the scientific community*.

*****

**[Nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion)** is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei collide together at a very high speed and form a new nucleus. For light elements like hydrogen or helium the fused nucleus weights less than the sum of the original nucleus. The missing mass is released as energy in accordance with Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equations. Fusion is the process that powers active or ""main sequence"" stars.

[Primer on fusion power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power)

[Current mainstream approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power#Possible_approaches) include:

* [Magnetic confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_confinement_fusion), used in tokamak, spheromak and stellarator designs

* [Inertial confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion), used at the National Ignition Facility

* [Electrostatic confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_electrostatic_confinement), used by the fusor and Polywell devices

* [Magnetized target fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetized_target_fusion) and [Magneto-Inertial fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto-inertial_fusion), hybrid approaches used by General Fusion and Helion Energy

facebook,1,"# The moderators of this subreddit are not associated with Facebook or Meta.

**Welcome to /r/Facebook.**

This community is for:

* Posting technical support questions.

* Posting articles about the platform
  * This can include videos as long as they are not your own YouTube videos and are ""professional"" in nature.

* Starting civilized discussions about the platform.

**Rules**

1. **Posts must relate to Meta/Facebook.**
  Do not make posts unrelated to this topic. This includes screenshots of Facebook posts without a request for tech support.

2. **Do not post anything that contains personal information.**
  We do not allow posts or comments to contain any personal information, even if it’s your own. This includes names. The only exception to this rule is if the information is related to a public figure.

3. **No self-promotion, spam, misinformation or clickbait.**
  We do not allow spam, misinformation or clickbait.

  This is also not the place to advertise your Facebook page, website, GoFundMe or anything else. We have this rule in place to help protect the community from spam and other malicious content.

  Including a link to a Facebook profile, page, group or post in a tech support context also violates this rule.

4.  **No joke or meme posts.**
  There are other communities with millions of subscribers dedicated to memes and humor. There is no need for it to be here. If you want memes and humor on Reddit, check out r/funny or r/memes.

5. **No NSFW content.**
  This is a safe for work community. If you have a tech support problem that is related to NSFW (such as ""why am I seeing NSFW ads on my feed""), you can describe the issue in text. Do not post a screenshot of the content.

6.  **If Facebook is down, do not post about it.**
  There will be a stickied announcement if Facebook goes down.

7. **No hate speech, trolling or harassment.**
  Do not insult others, or post hateful content. This is a tech support and discussion community.

8. **Follow [reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) and the reddit [Terms of Service](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-september-12-2021).**
  These rules must be followed in all subreddits, and this one is no exception.


**Posting anything against the rules will get you a minimum of a three day ban.**

* Submit **converted gifs only**... for requests, check out /r/WastedGifRequests.

* Please try to avoid reposts. Reposts of recently submitted gifs or consistently reposted gifs will be removed.


* Only gifs containing people (or animals) actually being ""wasted"" are permitted. ""Wasted"" means that they fall over and (at least through editing) must stay on the ground, or out of sight through the remainder of the gif. Gifs containing a person/animal who remains on their feet will be removed by the moderators.

* Wasted gifs that are made by using wasted gif maker sites will be removed.

* NSFW content should be tagged as such. Please, no overly-graphic content like porn, gore or death. Moderators will remove inappropriate submissions at their discretion.

* There's a spoiler tag available under the 'flair' option, *use it.*  If your post contains anything from a show or movie that could potentially spoil it for others, **use this tag.**


The mod team may remove posts/comments at their own discretion to maintain sub wellbeing.

programminghorror,7,"**RULES:**

- All posts MUST show terrible code. There are no exceptions.

- No Editor Themes - If it's just your editor that looks bad, it doesn't belong here.

- No Advertisement Code. This is generally written by people in marketing who only know what ""code"" looks like from other ads. It's not real code, so it doesn't belong.

- No Student Code. Yes, they're learning, but bad code is part of the process.

- No Generated Code. If it's minified JS, generated XML, or what have you, we don't want it here. Yes, the YouTube homepage has an extra right-angle bracket. We know.

- No Asking for Help. Go to r/learnprogramming. What are you doing here?

- No Spamming/Advertising. We don't care about your shitty Youtube video or new crypto that will ""change the world"".

- Be Nice. No hate speech of any kind is allowed, as well as generally being a jerk. Talk about the code, not eachother.

- No Direct Contact of the Mods. Please use the modmail, we don't want to be contacted directly.

- Please direct stories without code to /r/talesfromtechsupport, and programming questions to /r/learnprogramming


**Programming Horror** is where developers come together to revel in the idiocy of our peers.

This subreddit is meant for sharing funny programming related stories and strange or straight-up awful code.

For the sake of not being mauled by rabid lawyer bears, please make sure to *anonymize your stories* - changing the names of people and companies.

For code examples, indent all your lines with 4 spaces to make it more readable:

    foo = 'bar'

#USEFUL LINKS
####[GCXRep Guide](https://redd.it/3wy5h4)[Go back to /r/GCX](/r/giftcardexchange)

#RULES

This sidebar list is a quick reference. You are responsible for reading and following the **[GCX detailed rules wiki linked here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules)** as well as the **[GCX Rep Guide linked here.](https://redd.it/3wy5h4)** Ignorance of the rules is no excuse for breaking them.

___

1\. **Posting Format Requirements:** *Just type in your username in the ""YOURUSERNAME"" area of the title, and put the date you joined Reddit in the ""DATE YOU JOINED REDDIT"" area. [See the GCX Rep Guide linked here.](https://redd.it/3wy5h4)*

___

2\. **GCX Rule 2 Active Redditor:** *Redditors must meet age and activity requirements before posting, commenting, or trading, and only active redditors can be traded with. [See details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_2._active_redditor)*

___

3\. **Confirming Trades:** *YOU are the only one who can make a parent comment on YOUR trading profile. Use the appropriate format. [See the GCX Rep Guide linked here.](https://redd.it/3wy5h4)*

___

4\. **Linking Archived Profiles:** *All threads after 6 months are archived by reddit and set to view only. (Note that this is done by reddit, not by the moderators of GCXRep.) You will need to make a new profile. Copy the LINK of your old profile and paste it in the body of your new profile, and edit your archived profile, [like this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GCXRep/comments/363uhz/upuck17_gcx_rep_profile/?sort=new) This way traders can view all of your old trades. Do not retype your old trades. Do not submit a new profile unless your previous one was archived. [See the GCX Rep Guide linked here.](https://redd.it/3wy5h4)*  
___
5\.  **One confirmation per trade and only one confirmation per unique trader per 24 hours**: For example: if you buy $25 Amazon from a user in the morning and then $50 Amazon from that same user in the afternoon, it can only count once on your GCX rep profile.

___
6\. **/r/GCXRep is for /r/giftcardexchange Only**: /r/GCXrep is for trades conducted on /r/giftcardexchange only. Confirming trades done off the exchange, either on another sub or in private, or trades that violate /r/giftcardexchange's [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules) is expressly forbidden.

___

7\. **Rep Information Requirement** You must specify the value of all gift cards involved in the trade. The amounts of cash exchanged do not need to be specified though. So for example, ""Amazon vs. PayPal"" is not allowed, ""$25 Amazon vs PayPal"" is good
___

LifeProTips,7,"**What is a Life Pro Tip?**

A Life Pro Tip (or an LPT) is a specific action with definitive results that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.

**Keep in mind that giving someone advice is not the same as giving someone a LPT.** Advice is offering someone guidance or offering someone a recommendation.

Examples of advice:

 “Always be prepared to leave your employer because they are prepared to leave you.”

“A marriage proposal should not come as a big surprise, despite what you may have seen in the movies.”

**Keep in mind that an aphorism is not a LPT.**

An aphorism is a a short clever saying that is intended to express a general truth or a concise statement of a principle.

Examples of aphorisms:

""A barking dog never bites.""

""No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.""

""All stones are broken stones.""

---

**RULES:**

1. No rude, offensive, racist, homophobic, sexist, aggressive or hateful posts/comments.
2. Posts must begin with ""LPT"" or ""LPT Request” and be flaired. Titles must be descriptive. The tip and the problem it solves must be explained thoroughly. 
3. Tag tips for adult audiences as NSFW.
4. Do not post tips that could be considered common sense, common courtesy, unethical, or illegal.
5. Do not post tips that are based on spurious, unsubstantiated, or anecdotal claims.
6. Posts concerning the following are not allowed: religion, politics, relationships, law and legislation, parenting, driving, medicine or hygiene (including mental health).
7. Do not post tips in reaction to other posts. Reposts may be removed.
8. Do not post tips that are advertisements or recommendations of products or services.
9. Posts or comments that troll and/or do not substantially contribute to the discussion may be removed.

Note that moderators will use their own discretion to remove any post that they believe is low-quality or not considered a LPT.

---

**BANNING POLICY:**

Bans are given out immediately and serve as a warning.

You may appeal this initial ban by messaging the moderators and agreeing not to break the rules again. 
You must acknowledge the rule you broke!


Note: Bans will not be reversed if the post/comment in question has been deleted from your history.

NoSlep is a place for authors to share their original horror stories. The purpose of this subreddit is to share stories with and scare the crap out of each other. This is not a place for you to practice your writing skills, or to post crepypasta. Remember, everything is true on NoSlep.

----

**Posting Guidelines:**

 * Only post if your submission is your original story. Questions about the subreddit, irrelevant posts, troll/joke posts, crepypasta, and posts consisting solely of an image, video, or link will be removed.

 * Your story should be believable within reason. Posts that are not believable will be removed at moderator discretion.

 * Everything is true here, even if it's not. You don't need to put any variation of ""this is 666% true"" in your title or your story.

 * Please do not comment out of character on your post.

 * Please do not put tags in your title. Tags are anything in brackets or parenthesis that does not reference part of your story. Titling it ""Scary story [part one]"" is OK, but ""Scary Story [TRUE]"" is not.

 * Multi-part stories must include links to the first and next parts in their bodies, and a mention of multiple parts in the title.

**Comment Guidelines:**

 * No debunking, doubting, or disbelief.

 * Do not ask for proof.

 * Be respectful to one another.

 * This is not a writing workshop. Do not criticize anyone's writing skills here.

 * Comments should contribute to the discussion. GIFs, jokes, and comments saying ""Nope,"" ""All aboard the nopetrain,"" ""Then who was phone,"" and variations of those phrases will be removed at moderator discretion.

**About the ""Everything is True"" rule:**

r/noslep is a place for you to go and read campfire-style scary stories written by fellow NoSlepers. Stories should be believable, but realistic fiction is permitted. Readers are to assume everything is true and treat it as such as far as commenting is concerned. These stories are here for your entertainment. If a story is too unbelievable, please report it for mod review.

**Any violation of these rules will result in slep.**

stalker,3,"**Where to buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.**

*[Always use IsThereAnyDeal to assess the best game prices](https://isthereanydeal.com/search/?q=S.T.A.L.K.E.R.)* (ignore the erroneous Microsoft Store entry, which is for a different game)!

If you cannot/are unwilling to pay for S.T.A.L.K.E.R., please continue to scroll down and find some completely free, standalone S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games released by the community to try out.

***

**Abbreviations & Time-To-Beat:**

Assuming full story + some side quests completed, with no free-play/replaying:

* Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC) ≈ 32 hours
* Clear Sky (CS) ≈ 16 hours
* Call of Pripyat (CoP) ≈ 19 hours

These are stats from one of the subreddit moderators. Alternatively, check [HowLongToBeat.com](https://howlongtobeat.com/?q=S.T.A.L.K.E.R.#search1).

***

**For your first experience:**

*Always* start with SoC, and then play either of the other two in any order (usually in the order of release). If you only want/have time to play one of the three, Shadow of Chernobyl is still the recommended one to play, because (spoiler-free) the other two carry on with a certain game element that assumes past plot knowledge, and feels awkwardly (and possibly annoyingly) unexplained without experience of SoC.

**Adjustments for your first play-through:**

* [Explanation of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. difficulty levels](https://redd.it/7fxvt5)
* [Explanation of SoC's gunplay](https://redd.it/8b6u4q)
* Optional: [Why you should play without music](https://redd.it/cyymue)

**For all games**: apply both the latest [AtmosFear and Absolute Nature content](http://www.absolute.crommcruac.com) as are available, *after* applying the tweaks below first

* **For SoC**:

 * Apply community bug fix [Zone Reclamation Project](http://www.metacognix.com/files/stlkrsoc/index.html) (ZRP, maintained by /u/NatVak); not convinced? Read [Metacognix arguments for ZRP](http://www.metacognix.com/stlkrsoc/ZRP_FAQ.html)

  * [Follow these steps to increase](https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/fbpzjw/stalker_gameplay_help_desk_for_the_month_of_march/fj7tnn2/) **Actor.ltx**'s `camera_height_factor` from `0.85` to `0.94` via Notepad, so that you are at proper head height with NPCs, though you may need to crouch to pick up some items and this might make combat easier

* **For CS**: Apply community bug fix [Sky Reclamation Project](https://github.com/Decane/SRP) (SRP; report bugs [here](https://github.com/Decane/SRP/issues/)), and be sure to apply some of its included optional add-ons, like Alternative Ballistics and decreased AI grenade spam

*Note: ZRP and SRP above will provide a free-play mode after the ending cinematic, if you reach the best ending to each game.*

* **For CoP**:

 * [Increase field of view to 54 or 55](https://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaul/downloads/field-of-view-switcher-17) (Arsenal Overhaul not needed)

 * Reduce the crosshair to an immersion-maintaining dot by placing [this ""gamedata"" folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w3NeLH53x_OjGIH5_IYY1jNsKclPhfpp) in CoP's root directory

If you have any questions or problems, [please comment on AutoModerator's latest help post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/search/?q=author%3AAutoModerator&restrict_sr=1&sort=new) and other fans may help you. Please note that installing Sky Reclamation Project and AtmosFear will render existing saved-game files unusable until they are uninstalled.

* **[Anomaly](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/)**: a realistically overwhelming spiritual successor to the outdated mod Last Day – which is based on the mod Call of Misery – which is a fusion of CoP mods Misery and Call of Chernobyl (adds mutant meat-cooking, ammo quality tiers, DIY maintenance/upgrades, artifact irradiation directly from one's inventory, [Azazel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azazel) posthumous continuation mode, 1-thru-8 inventory filters, and a new plot after CoP)

  * Consider [Community Curated Add-ons and Reshades by Grok
](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZt3EFi05VJmlz-l755LtqvArlGqSTEbjNQsB9z7z94/edit)
  * Also consider restoring [English Voices](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/english-voices) for traders and other special characters (verified to work with 1.5.1)
  * [Join the devs' official Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/c4RuJNs)

* **[Dead Air](https://www.moddb.com/mods/dead-air)**: total overhaul of CoP-based mod Call of Chernobyl by the author of Call of Misery (not intended for beginners!)
* **[Lost Alpha](http://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha)**: fan improvement on original, unreleased SoC version which includes vehicle-driving

#Subreddit Rules

In order to keep the sidebar clean, short, and concise, a more complete and expanded list of rules and guidelines has been posted in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/wiki/rules). Failure to read it is not an excuse for breaking the rules. 

1. **Respect the [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette).**
2. **All submissions must be solely related to and focused on Rainmeter and/or its associated components.** Any submissions featuring Windows themes, general Windows configurations, other tools/programs, overall setups, etc. should go to their respective communities. 
3. **Provide download links for ALL skins, wallpapers, resources, and tools used in your suite submissions and other posts where applicable** (click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/wiki/flair) to see when links must be provided). Please see the [rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/wiki/rules) for more details regarding how links should be shared. 
4. **General questions may only be asked in the pinned weekly help thread.** Complex questions regarding specific rainmeter components can be posted on the subreddit for extra troubleshooting visibility, but otherwise, general questions go to the pinned weekly help thread.
5. **No creation requests or asking for recommendations/identification.** You may request help with the creating and curating of your own work, but you cannot ask others to create something for you. Also, any posts asking for recommendations or identification must be made at r/rainmeterrequests.
6. **Only state something as an “Original Creation” if you personally created (i.e. coded) and designed the majority of it yourself.** Otherwise, it is not OC and calling it as such is plagiarism. All other tools and/or code used in your creation must be attributed their respective credit as well.
7. **Do not instinctively comment about a lack of originality or put down how others choose to use rainmeter.** Debate and discussion are welcome, but always remember to keep it healthy, be respectful of others, and offer constructive criticism.

Any posts that break the rules will be removed, with or without warning."

# Rules


#**No hateful comments about any animals. No hateful comments about people. No suggestions of violence toward animals.  No breed  hate. No animal cruelty. We will ban you for content such as this.**

- If you see any posts that violate any of the rules, please report the post and message the mods a link to it

1. Please only post animals being jerks, not humans being jerks.

2. We're here to have a laugh, please keep posts funny. That means no posts of animals being killed or seriously injured. 

3. Do not post content that is already in the [top 50 posts of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingJerks/top/) You can check for reposts by copying the link and pasting [here]( http://karmadecay.com/r/animalsbeingjerks?url=ref). Recent reposts will also be removed. Reposts within 3 months of each other will be removed. Reposts may also result in a temporary ban. Permanent ban for constant reposting.  If you submit a post that has already been reposted more than 3 times, your post will get removed.  

4. If your post is NSFW, please label it as such.

5. Refrain from promoting hate speech, racism, sexism, religion-bashing, name-calling, insults, and any other abusive/threatening language. ""Abusive language"" includes posts which are malicious or insulting in nature.

6. No memes or comics.  No compilation videos and collection of pictures/gifs.  

7. Posts must depict animals actually being jerks. Please do not post animals engaging in normal animal behavior which might simply inconvenience humans, and do not make posts which require you to add context for the jerky behavior to be understood. Moderators will remove such posts at their discretion.  

8. All submissions must show an animal actively being a jerk. Animals posing next to shredded pillows etc are not allowed. The jerkiness must be evident from the material posted.  


*Moderators reserve the right to remove content they deem harmful to the sub.*

A community for the dumbass in all of us. We all have those moments where we do something ridiculously stupid. Share your stories and laugh along with the internet.

##Rules
##### *hover for details*

######[](#space)
> ### 1.  Use proper formatting: (1) All titles must start with TIFU. (2) All posts must have at least 750 characters in the body. (3) All posts must have a ""TL;DR summary"" at the end.

######[](#space)
> ### 2.  Posts must be about you.  Today **I** fucked up.  Not your grandma, not some dude you saw in the newspaper.  

######[](#space)
> ### 3.  **Must be your fault**. Being a victim of something is not TIFU. Getting robbed, scammed, attacked, cheated on, etc, is not TIFU

######[](#space)
> ### 4.  No overly vulgar posts.  Eg:  No pissing/&#8203;shitting your pants.  No incest/&#8203;rape&#8203;/&#8203;minors/&#8203;bestiality.  No death of animals.  No glorification of major crimes.

######[](#space)
> ### 5.  Not a fuckup.  No humblebrags or stories that have zero consequences and don't go anywhere.  Eg ""tifu by sexy sex"".  Moderator discretion.    

######[](#space)
> ### 6.  Be civil.  No racism/&#8203;bigotry/&#8203;homophobia/&#8203;transphobia.  No personal attacks on other users, no name-calling.  No low-effort ""this didn't happen"" type comments.  [READ MORE HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/wiki/rule6)

######[](#space)
> ### 7.  No self promotion.  No making posts with the express purpose of promoting your business/video game/porn career. Even if not mentioned within the text of the post, alluding to links on your profile is not allowed. This covers implying you will set up a stream/public link/onlyfans in the future, having set up one in the past, or anything along the lines of ""upvote this comment if you want me to do this."" These examples are by no means comprehensive, just don't self promote.

## Notes
#### **TIFUpdate** if you are posting a follow-up post to update us on your story, you can start it with ""TIFUpdate"".

Antivaxx rhetoric or participation on antivaxx subreddits is cause for a ban from this subreddit.

Participating in covid disinformation subreddits is grounds to be denied access to this community. In our experience people who frequent these types of subreddits do not participate in good faith and are not a good fit for the type of atmosphere we wish to foster on this subreddit.

Stance,10,"**A subreddit dedicated to modifying the stance of cars! All cars have a stance, even if it's stock! It's up to your interpretation if it's good or bad! Whether it's slammed, lifted, stretched, meaty, etc, it's all welcome! Share your ride, critique others, set up meets, or just simply ask for help/input on anything!**

________________________________


 **Our Rules:**  

* When you make a post, take note that we are the 1% of the 1%. Realize you may be criticized.

* We welcome critiques! But blatant hate and rudeness will not be tolerated. Please report any such activity. 

* Single images** must be rehosted on [imgur](http://www.imgur.com). This is a convenience to RES users. Feel free to link to galleries or features. Flickr might be okay as well for your photographers and such. I'll look into the future of changing this.

* Make an effort to** credit photographers and content owners within post titles or comments, even if it's your own car. Image watermarks will suffice.  

* Any content that is NSFW must be tagged as such.

* Please don't come here to promote your site or blog. Posts that serve no purpose other than to promote your blog/site/facebook page will be removed on sight.  

* This is not a place to sell parts. Please do not make classified posts as we have no way of protecting buyers or sellers. 

* I know this is the internet so you can hate what you want, but we do not support any hostility towards /r/shitty_car_mods, we are supporters of that subreddit. 

______________________

**Messaging The Mods**  
  






If you believe that your post got caught in the spam filter or you have a general question, please message the Mods. If you encounter a post that you feel needs to be reported, please do report it.

secretsanta,6,"# What is redditgifts?

/r/secretsanta and Reddit Gifts were started in 2009 to provide a Secret Santa exchange for the Reddit community. On January 24, 2022, Redditgifts was officially closed and we are no longer running exchanges. LONG LIVE REDDITGIFTS!  

# Rules

Posts which include the following will be removed to the mods discretion:
 
1. Posted by throwaways, alt accounts or on behalf of another user as we cannot investigate the issue at hand.
2. Complaints about gifts, Santas, or giftees. This should go through [official channels](https://www.redditgifts.com/info) rather than public shaming.
4. Asking for one-on-one exchanges outside of redditgifts.
5. Offering to send a gift to someone who wasn't matched or who didn't get a gift.
6. ""Gift spoilers."" Let your giftee see their gift for the first time when open the box, not on /r/SecretSanta.
7.  We are a meme-free subreddit.
8.  No karma whoring.
9. This is one of the nicest places on the Internet, so we expect participants to be polite and civil to one another. 

## Self promotion

Despite the [closure of the marketplace](http://redd.it/2xdkyi) and Redditgifts, we continue to disallow self-promotion in /r/SecretSanta.

*Currently NOT looking for other moderators*

----

> **Guide to good comments/submissions:**

>1. Remember, *it's not a bug, it's a feature*. It's a lot more fun to explain something if it isn't written off as a bug.

>2. There are no NPCs. Aside from animals, everybody is a ""player"".

>3. The devs are lazy and rarely do much. The game is mostly balanced as it is according to them, therefore they don't do much aside from ""natural"" world events.

>4. The game is mostly run by the players. All in-game items and rules are determined by players, not mods or devs.

>5. The players are responsible for in-game events. The devs are responsible for ""natural"" events. So stop begging the devs to add in a new type of car. It's player-made.

>6. There are no ""in-game moderators""; there *are* players with more power than the average player. Police officers, lawyers, politicians and the like are other players. They aren't technically moderators.

>7. **Terms to avoid:** mods, DLC, hacks, glitches, cheats, textures or anything similar

>8. **NO MEMES.** Advice animals, or variants thereof, will result in a ban.

>9. When in doubt, ask yourself, ""does my post make this sound like a cheap World of Warcraft/Everquest/UO ripoff?"" If yes, it probably shouldn't be posted.

>10. Avoid top-level discussion of the game; don't discuss stuff like in-game settings or options.

>11. The moderators of this subreddit reserve the right to remove any post for being too far off from these guidelines. This includes submissions that follow the letter of the guidelines, but not the spirit.

>12. No posts about wanting to quit the game or advice on how to quit the game. You will be banned and your account flagged for Reddit to send you the support you need.

>13. Unflaired posts when a flair is applicable will be removed and a short ban issued. Repeated violations may result in a permanent ban.

#Posting Rules

1) **All posts must be accompanied by a body of text**. This text should give a brief overview of the post intent.

2) **All add-on or content requests must be in the stickied thread.**

3) **Please use a clear descriptive title when posting**. Avoid titles such as ""Problem with x"", ""Question about x"" or ""Need help with x"". The title should be descriptive enough to allow other users to search if they have a similar question.

4) **Posts must be directly related to and focused on an unofficial addon or addons for Kodi**. Off topic posts including other streaming methods or official addons belong in another sub (see the list below). 

5) Anyone representing a site or service is welcome to post and participate in this sub, but they must also participate in the comments of their own post and the posts of other users.

6) **Only one advertisement of your own site should be present on the first page of the sub**. If there is already an advertisement of your own site on the first page, wait until it drifts off of it before posting another advertisement. 

7) **Include all information when asking for assistance**. As a basic requirement, users need to provide the following information before any assistance can be offered:

* Operating System: Android/Windows/OSX, etc...

* Device: Nvidia Shield/FireTV, etc...

* Add-on affected: Exodus/Venom/Seren, etc...

* Version of Kodi: 17.6/18.2, etc...

* Version of add-on: 1.1.10/1.1.11, etc...

* Country: USA/Australia/UK, etc...

* Any support services: Real-Debrid/Premiumize/Trakt, etc...

* Link to a [debug/error log](https://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy).

8) **No referral links**. Public posting of referral links is not allowed.

holdmyjuicebox,9,"Rules:

1) Post must contain someone failing as the result of a limited childlike understanding of the world or a lack of judgment. 

2) Must be a child.  No teens.  No adults.   As a rule of thumb, if the person failing is too old to be drinking juice boxes, they are too old to be featured on this subreddit.

3) Don't harass people. 

4) Do not post personal information on anybody - especially the children in the post.

5) No posts of children street fighting.

6) Any type of child pornography will be removed and will result a permanent ban from the subreddit (and most likely all of reddit).

7) No reposts.

8) If it is NSFW, please say so.

9) Cute is not the goal, cute posts may be removed.

10) No staged or commercial content.

11) No serious harm or injuries. This is intended to be a light-hearted subreddit.

# Posting

When requesting help or asking questions please prefix your title with the SQL variant/platform you are using within square brackets like so:

* [MySQL]
* [Oracle]
* [MS SQL]
* [PostgreSQL]
* etc

While naturally we should endeavor to work as platform neutrally as possible many questions and answers require tailoring to the feature set of a specific platform.

##Help posts

If you are a student or just looking for help on your code please do not just post your questions and expect the community to do all the work for you. We will gladly help where we can as long as you post the work you have already done or show that you have attempted to figure it out on your own.


#Format Your Code

If you are including actual code in a post or comment, please attempt to format it in a way that is readable for other users.  This will greatly increase your chances of receiving the help you desire.  Something as simple as line breaks and using reddit's built in code formatting (4 spaces at the start of each line) can turn this:

SELECT count(a.field1), a.field2, SUM(b.field4) FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.key1 = b.key1 WHERE a.field8 = 'test' GROUP by a.field1, a.field2 HAVING SUM(b.field4) > 5 ORDER by a.field.3

Into this:

    SELECT count(a.field1),
      a.field2,
      SUM(b.field4) 
    FROM a INNER JOIN b 
      ON a.key1 = b.key1 
    WHERE a.field8 = 'test' 
    GROUP by a.field1, 
      a.field2 
    HAVING SUM(b.field4) > 5 
    ORDER by a.field3

For those with SQL questions we recommend using [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) to provide a useful development and testing environment for those who wish to fully understand your problem and help devise a solution.

#Learning SQL

A common question is how to learn SQL. Please [view the Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/wiki/index) for online resources.

Note /r/SQL does not allow links to basic tutorials to be posted here. Please [see this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/2jcw2y/what_do_we_think_about_tutorials_especially_basic/). You should post these to /r/learnsql instead.

nocontext,9,"The title of your submission should be a quote taken out of context from a reddit comment.  
Links must be to text submissions on reddit only.

#Rules:
1. Post titles must be a quote from a comment or post on Reddit. The quote must be of at least one sentence in length.

2. Posts must link to the source of the quote and provide enough of the context of the quote for a reader to understand why the quote was said.

3. Posted quotes must have at least two meanings. One of these meanings should be what a reader would think without context and another meaning should be what people were actually talking about.

4. Comments should forward the discussion at least minimally. Comments that are only insults do not do this. Comments with a condescending tone or that insult, but continue the conversation will be judged on a case by case basis.

#How to submit:

1. [Check the rules to make sure what you want to post belongs here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext/wiki/rules)

2. Your post title should be a quote.

3. You must submit as a link.

4. The link should be a permalink to a comment or a post on Reddit.

5. Add ?context=4 to the end of the link. You may use another number, but please use a number high enough to contain the full context. **Having the full context means that users can tell how the quoted-title means something different than what they thought it meant before clicking through.**

6. Unless Metabot beats you to it, after submitting, post a reply to your quotee letting them know they have been sent to r/nocontext.

***Please report all submissions that do not belong in r/nocontext using the report button. It helps the moderators remove bad links more quickly.***

Comments that do not need additional context will be removed.

***Having trouble with the theme?***

RES users may experience conflicts with our custom theme, as RES is overzealous when applying its own styling (highlighting being a prime example) and breakages occur quite frequently.  We have detailed how to fix a common highlighting issue [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1ejx7t/highlighted_comments_hard_to_read/ca1nx3r), and a more recent highlighting issue [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1m1b3l/does_anyone_really_think_that_this_is_a_good/cc5kyxx).  RES users may benefit from switching to NIGHT-MODE too.  If you would prefer not to use our custom theme, you can disable custom themes globally in your reddit preferences (just untick ""allow subreddits to show me custom styles"" in the ""display options"" section), or locally by de-selecting 'Use subreddit style' at the top of this sidebar."

#####On Futurology

If history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called ""future(s)"" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). 

One of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur.

2. State clearly what is being or what you want calculated in the title. [Request] posts must have a calculable answer; otherwise, they will be removed.

3. Give credit where credit is due—include the user who made the calculations in any post you submit: ex. ""[RDTM] /u/FragTheWhale  calculates..."".

4. For easy and quick math results (ex. How many feet are in a mile?) use [Wolfram|Alpha™](http://www.wolframalpha.com). Posts containing ""simple math"" will be removed, as well as requests whose answers are easily searchable online, and any other post at the moderators' discretion. For more abstract math, try /r/math or /r/learnmath.

5. Posts which seem to be asking for help on homework will be removed. Try /r/homeworkhelp or /r/cheatatmathhomework instead.

###Comment Rules
1. This subreddit has a zero-tolerance policy for hateful or unnecessary language. There is no warning for hate speech of any kind. Rule breaking posts/comments will have a temporary ban that will serve as a first offense ""warning"". Repeat or egregious offenders will be banned permanently. Reddit's [site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) still apply here. Also, don't be a dick.

2. Do not submit top-level comments in [Request] posts that are not an attempt at an answer or a request for clarification. Jokes or off-topic top-level comments will be removed.

3. When answering [Request] posts, please cite reputable sources to defend any evidence that cannot be proven using your own math.

iamverybadass,10,"**Rules:**

1. No memes, images of t-shirts, vehicle decals, bumper stickers, vehicle window clings/stickers, or license plates.  If the shirt is spotted worn out in public (in the wild) then it's fine.

2. Remove personal/identifying information.  This includes: - Subreddits **including this one**, Post titles - Reddit usernames **including your own** - Social media usernames and hashtags  - Public figures (check marked) are fair game.

3. No trolling. (Don't post them and don't be one)

4. Rudeness, uncivil behavior, vulgarity, threats, etc. towards any member of this subreddit will not be tolerated. If your post or comment is found to be racist or bigoted you will be banned without warning.

5. No reposts within the past three months or from the top 30 submissions of all time.

6. Don't Post Arguments.  Arguments tend to be two or more people trying to one up each other.  Try to stick to/isolate the main badassery comment. Lengthy arguments will be auto-deleted.  

7. Remove any personal information or links to personal information.  Do not request, demand or disclose (in a joking manner or not) the names of Reddit or non Reddit users or where to find the submission in a direct or indirect manner (example: hinting that it can be found in your post history)  Doing so may result in an immediate and permanent ban.

8. If this is something that a reasonable person would do then it should not be posted here. 

9. Don't tell us where you found your badass, whether you think it counts, or if it's a resubmission. Please make your title descriptive.

10.  Satire. We are looking for people genuinely trying to show off. Often the line between satire and genuine badassery can become blurred.  So we will judge if it's satire on a case by case basis. If it's satire, the post will be tagged as such.  After the post is tagged as satire, you don't need to keep reminding us that it's satire.  We know and we will laugh at you."

Undertale,7,"-

[**UNDERTALE**](https://undertale.com/) is an indie RPG created by developer Toby Fox about a child, who falls into an underworld filled with monsters. Their only weapon being their DETERMINATION as they try to FIGHT or ACT their way out. Will you show monsters standing in your way MERCY, or slaughter them all?

More UNDERTALE?! Not exactly, but if the game left you craving for more, check out Toby’s next project, [**Deltarune**](https://www.deltarune.com/)! As of right now, the first two chapters are out and you can try them out for free!

##The Underground awaits

[**Welcome to r/Undertale**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/welcome), Reddit’s largest UT community, a place for fans to share fanworks, memes (occasionally not skeleton related), hold discussions and argue about the same three theories ad nauseum. Posts about Deltarune and [Alternate Universes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/what_are_aus) of both games are also welcomed!

[**Flair guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/flairguide)

* Breakdown of purpose and use of subreddit’s flairs.

##Subreddit's rules

**1) Be relevant to Undertale or Deltarune**

* Keep your posts on topic! Posts discussing/sharing content about Undertale AUs, Deltarune AUs, or the subreddit itself are also permitted. If the connection to UT/DR is too tenuous, the post may be removed under this rule as well.

**2) No sexual or otherwise obscene content**

* Do not share or discuss content that is more sexually suggestive or obscene than the game itself.

**3) No bootleg merchandise and pirated content**

* Don't promote the kinds of merchandise that Toby is not okay with. [Details here](https://undertale.tumblr.com/post/139726155020/changing-policy-on-fan-merch)
* Discussions of piracy and attempts of illegal distribution of the game are not allowed. Additionally, since there is no official port of Undertale to mobile devices, most of the available ones count as piracy too. As such do not discuss or share screenshots of these versions here.

**4) No soliciting**

* Do not ask users to participate in anything that is not Undertale-based.
* Do not pit us against outsiders.
* Do not post about upvotes.
* Unless you are looking for help with fan project related to Undertale, please don't make posts that are just invitation to subreddit or discord
* Low effort linking to streams, or let’s plays is not allowed unless the stream is of special occasion (charity, some event…), or if the video is of higher production value

**5) Sharing art and fanworks**

* While sharing any form of fan work, tag your post with the appropriate flair distinguishing it as either OC or Found creation (or My / Found meme art). If the creation isn’t yours, name the artist in the title or link them in comments. Ideally both.
* Unless it's a well-known meme format, you must properly credit art used in memes and other post types.
* Redraws, comic dubs, covers of fan made songs or translations can be flaired as OC, but you have to clarify it in the title and provide a link to the original.
* Full version of the rule + how to track down art sources can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/unsourced)

**6) Etiquette**

* Remember the human on the other side of the screen and treat them with respect.
* Slurs, brigading and bigotry of any kind won’t be tolerated, regardless of the context.
* Being sharper with your words at times is fine, but don't overdo it.
* Posts and comments must be in English.

**7) Avoid reposts**

* Posts identical or nearly identical to recent submissions (recent being 6 months) will be removed as reposts,
* Exceptions to the 6 month rule are reposts of the top 100 posts and content you have already submitted, meaning they cannot be reposted even after 6 months have passed. 

**8) Avoid low effort posts**

For post to be considered low effort, two requirements must be fulfilled:

* The post was visibly sewed together quickly and there’s little to no effort on display.
* It falls directly under or is in spirit of (if your post is too similar to one of the listed formats, mods reserve the right to remove it as low effort) one the formats listed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/wiki/low_effort)

**9) Spoilers and Content policies**

Currently, these are the addional requirements post's content must abide:

* Posts asking questions which are answered in FAQ wiki page will be removed.
* No rapid posting (3+ posts in a span of an hour), space your submissions more or use picture galleries.
* Discussion, art and inclusion in polls of frans and similar aged up ships is not allowed on post level.

**All posts must be flaired.** Your post will get automatically removed if it is not flaired. For a guide on flairing and how to filter out flairs you don't like, click **[here](https://redd.it/a4u8k3)**. 

If you do not properly flair your post, or reply incorrectly to a post because you didn't know the difference between 'Battle' and 'Scan-Battle', you agree to forfeit to us your soul in perpetuity or another soul of equal or greater value.

Unsure of a good way to make your fight more interesting than just ""X Character vs. Y Character""? Check out our [Official Submission Template](/r/whowouldwin/wiki/index#wiki_suggested_template) for a few suggestions on how you can structure your battle with additional conditions and formatting to make it more interesting. 

---

**Rules** - [**Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhoWouldWin/wiki/rules)  

1. Be nice. Do not insult others, use derogatory terms, or resort to ad hominim arguments. 
2. Do not downvote. As this is a debate forum, we ask that you join the conversation, and not attempt to bury a point you don't like. If a post breaks the rules, please report it.
3. Repost with moderation. We will remove posts that are duplicated in quick succession. We do not allow very similar posts on the same day, or an individual posting very similar posts every couple of days repeatedly. However, revisiting topics every once in a while is allowed.
4. Do not make new posts more than 5 times a day.
5. When making a claim about a character, be able to provide the source of that claim. A source can include the work of media that claim comes from, and the chapter, page, scene, ETC where it occurred. Refusal to provide details is considered posting in bad faith, and can result in a warning or temporary ban.
6. Do not post meta-topics without mod approval. Meta-topics include conversation topics, tournaments, events, or other non-conventional posts. 
7. Do not use disruptive or gimmick accounts. Accounts posting with a gimmick or agenda in mind will be banned. 
8. Posts may not be overly broad. A post must identify at least one specific combatant and must include all combatants in the title.
9. Posts must include sufficient details about the characters, the situation and the win conditions. Posts with low effort descriptions will be removed. 
10. Do not use disallowed combatants and modifiers. Topics not allowed in posts include ""you vs..."", ""your favorite character vs..."", ""...in all of fiction,"" ""a specific subreddit or online community vs..."" or ""character with a [color] lantern ring vs...""
11. Posts and comments may not be deliberately distasteful, edgy, intended to bait drama, directly insulting, or clearly written to evoke shock value. 
12. Posts and comments may not push a specific political agenda. Posts involving any real life political figure will be removed.
13. Posts and comments may not simply be jokes, memes, circlejerk or copy-pasta topics. Posts that are funny are allowed, so long as they are also a topic that can effectively be discussed. 
14. Posts and comments that target a group of people (including but not limited to race, sex, gender identity, religion, political affiliation) are considered abuse and will be removed and the poster may be banned.
15. Comments must add to the conversation. Short comments like ""Goku stomps,"" or a single image as a non-responsive reply will be removed.

For more information on our posting rules, [click here](https://redd.it/3ungju).

------
  
**Additional Guidelines**:  

1. Include detail when posting. Try outlining arenas, special conditions, multiple rounds and specifying the universe/version of characters if you're looking for a good discussion. Again, please see the suggested template above for more details. 
  
2. Admit when you don't know. No one expects you to be a genius when it comes to every aspect of every character. Always admit it up front if you're unfamiliar with a character.


The penalty for breaking the rules of this sub, contributing to spam, trolling, or purposefully making things more difficult for the mods may include being banned. We issue warnings if we believe the user means well but we are not obligated to do so. *You can be banned for a first offense*. **Report rule breaking and leave rule enforcement to the mods**

Remember, the mods are humans, and we realize you're human, too. Be nice and we'll respond in kind. Apologies go a long way if you mess up.

To submit a battle, click the Goku vs Superman (or Doom vs Vader) button above. If you ask us how to do it, we'll know you didn't read this.

RatRod,1,"Wikipedia quote, ""A rat rod is a style of hot rod or custom car that, in most cases, imitates (or exaggerates) the early hot rods of the 40s, 50s, and 60s. It is not to be confused with the somewhat closely related ""traditional"" hot rod, which is an accurate re-creation or period-correct restoration of a hot rod from the same era.Most rat rods appear ""unfinished"" (whether they actually are or are not), with just the bare essentials to be driven.The rat rod is the visualization of the idea of function over form. Rat rods are meant to be driven, not shown off. Sometimes the customization will include using spare parts, or parts from another car altogether.""

8. Follow proper Reddiquette when submitting and commenting on posts. | | Civility is of the utmost importance; do not make personal attacks towards other users or use offensive language. Harassment, witch-hunting, sexism, racism or hate speech is not tolerated.
9. Questions must be fully stated with specificity in the title of a self-post. | |  No questions can be made using a link post. Questions asked at a high frequency will be removed and users will be directed to the Weekly FAQ Thread or subreddit FAQ.


Aside from the above rules, the sitewide rules of reddit are not exempt in this subreddit. In particular, vote manipulation and vote-brigading are against the [content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy), and can get you suspended from the entire site.

shiba,8,"Subreddit for anything related to Shiba Inus. Post your pictures, videos, questions, etc.

To add /r/shiba **flair** look above this message under the ""subscribe"" button and click ""edit"" next to your reddit username!

**Rules**

No advertising or marketing.  If you wish to advertise on this website, use the official channel [here](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising).  Promotions that involve product advertising are also prohibited.  **Organic product recommendations with links to products on sales sites are allowed.** However, we've been doing this a long time, and you will likely be banned if you try to represent your advertising as an organic product recommendation.  We do not recommend testing our ability to discern the difference, unfortunately we've had a lot of practice.  **If you try to subversively advertise we will not only ban you from r/shiba and r/shibainu, we often work with the website admins to to ban these users from reddit in its entirety.**

To post or enjoy **shibe memes** visit /r/shibe or one of the other related shibe subreddits.  **Meme-coin related submissions and comments in the shiba subreddits will result in a removal of posting privileges.**  Shibe memes and meme comments on /r/shiba will be removed, although referring to your shiba as shibe or doge as a term of endearment is fine.  In the same vein, meme related *titles* for your posts *are* allowed, but the content must adhere to the subreddit rules.  

Posting third-party content is okay, but **please do not post third-party content more than once per month.**  This is subject to moderator discretion, to ensure the organic nature of the subreddit.

Our community is the highest importance, no user is worth more than our community.  **Behavior detrimental to our community will be removed, and may result in a permanent removal of that user.**

**Backyard breeders will likely be banned, regardless of the intent for sale or not for sale.**  If you are not a reputable breeder do not post content about breeding your dogs here.  Use the following page as a guideline: https://www.shibas.org/breeders.html

If you feel you meet that standard, we recommend messaging the moderators for approval before posting.

**Shiba FAQ**

1) **Why is my shiba really itchy?** For previous discussion on this topic, checkout [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shiba/comments/2vmv3i/4_month_old_is_itching_throughout_the_day_any/) or [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shiba/comments/2w07qz/shiba_itches_constantly/).

2) **How do I find a reputable Shiba breeder?** The [National Shiba Club of America](http://www.shibas.org/breeders.html) maintains a listing of reputable Shiba breeders across the US. If you love dogs, please do not buy from a puppy mill or a backyard breeder. 

3) **My shiba doesn't seem to eat when I put food out, are they okay?**  While loss of appetite can be indicative of a problem, some shibas like to nibble throughout the day instead of eating in one sitting.  If you have this type of shiba, leave food out at all times, they will eat when they want.  However, monitor their weight and adjust accordingly if they begin to eat too much.  This behavior is also common when shibas are in a new environment or separated from their primary caretaker(s).

4) **My shiba spends a lot of time licking/grooming themselves, is this normal?**  While over-grooming may be indicative of allergies or other skin problems, shibas can spend a lot of time cleaning and manicuring themselves.  This behavior is normal.  Neurotic licking and biting to the point of hair-loss or scabbing is *not* normal and should be referred to a veterinarian.

5) **Why does my shiba take a long time to defecate on walks?**  Shibas often will not ""go"" near their home.  The farther they are from home, the more likely they will.  Sometimes they will have a common area that's used with frequency, once you've identified that area take them there.

6) **If you're the caretaker of a new shiba and you're looking for advice, please use the search feature.**  These questions are asked frequently, there is a wealth of information going back many years.  You will receive the greatest amount of advice with a simple search.  Feel free to ask anyway, but historically these questions are ignored by the majority of our community due to their frequency.

7) **My shiba seems sick and/or their health seems different, what should I do?**  Veterinarians spend *many* years of their lives training to become experts so they can help in these situations - go see one!  Even if a vet did respond, without seeing the dog in person a diagnosis will be lacking at best.  This community is not meant for medical advice, any advice you receive is likely going to be poor, misleading, or blatantly wrong.

8) **I would like socialize and train my shiba, where can I learn?**  Visit /r/Dogtraining, they can get you started, give you tips for specific behaviors, and recommend other sources to develop these skills.

## [](#icon-information)[Submission Rules](/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules)

1. Post titles must be a question about engineering and provide context — be specific. Remember to flair your post. Most general career related questions should be placed in the Monday Career Megathread. Review the wiki prior to posting.

1. No homework questions.

1. Avoid questions that can easily be answered by searching on the internet.

## [](#icon-information)Flair Guide

* **Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical, and Computer** are reserved for technical questions only.

* **Discussion** can be used for general questions that apply to multiple disciplines, including some workplace topics. Note that questions must still be specific to engineering and not a general opinion survey.

## [](#icon-information)[Comment Rules](/r/AskEngineers/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_rules)

1. **Be respectful to other users.** All users are expected to behave with courtesy. Racism, sexism, or any other form of bigotry will not be tolerated.

1. **Don't answer if you aren't knowledgeable.** Answers must contain an explanation using engineering logic, and assertions of fact must be supported by links to credible sources.

1. **Be substantive.** No low-effort one-liner comments, memes, or off-topic replies. Limit the use of engineering jokes.

>#Instant Regret 
> ##(in'-stint rē-gret') n.
> ####a subreddit dedicated to deliberate actions that unexpectedly lead to undesirable consequences and horrible results; things which may cause someone to say, ""oh man, did I just screw the pooch!""

---

>###Guidelines & Rules


>####**1) Videos and gifs must show regret.** No text messages or still frames.  Sometimes the display of regret is unmistakable. It can be evident in someone's face, or in their body language. Sometimes it's a judgment call. If you think it works, try it out. If we delete it, you were wrong. We are Reddit™ moderators. We are always right!
  
>####**A fail is not a regret.** Some ripper eating a swellbow while trying to bone a rail on the backside, (that's skater lingo for a bad crash. I looked it up (made it up)), isn't regret. There should be a look of surprise, and an expression that clearly says, ""Oh no. Oh, God no. I really should not have done that. Why did I do that?""

>#Other examples that aren't regret:  

>* An immediate reaction to pain.  

>* Eating bad food and not liking it is not regret. You knew what was going to happen, dumbass. 

>* Laughter is not an expression of regret. It's just not.  

>* A picture of a sunburn or a crappy tattoo is not evidence of regret.  For all we know you like looking like a pumpkin, and definitely still want that potato tattoo on your ankle.

>####**2) Regret must be instant or near-instant.** If someone does something which only has bad consequences minutes or hours later, it is not considered instant. 

> ####**3) No Animal Abuse.** We love animals. They are capable of regret, but we don't want to see videos where their regret is the fault of humans, involves cruelty, injury or is in any way unpleasant. 

> ####**4) No compilations.** Just pick one good thing and go with it. Everybody likes it when you do that. 

>####**5) If the video is longer than 20 seconds,** please use a tag to tell everyone when the lead-up to the regrettable moment begins. For example [regret at 4:20]. Or post the video queued up to the point where things get good and the regret quickly follows. But, ultimately, these are just excellent suggestions. You're the director. Make it good. And don't worry. If it sucks, we'll get rid of it for you.

>####**6) Reposts are highly discouraged.** Reposts are allowed, but reposts which have been posted recently or are in the [top of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/instant_regret/top/?sort=top&t=all) will be removed.

> ####**No Dannys.** If your name is Danny and we find out we will ban you.

---

>###WE HATE SPAM!

>####We remove spam.

>####We exact vengeance on those who give us spam.

>####If you see spam, report spam.

>####If you see an account that uses a YouTube channel that takes videos from other channels in order to accumulate karma on said account. **Report that account,** We'll take care of it.

---

>####and finally...

>###REMEMBER YOUR REDDIQUETTE

>####Please, no abusive comments, hate speech, or any other personal attacks.

>####Doxing, brigading, and witch-hunting are not allowed.

>####This includes derailing commentary sections to complain about prolific users, and by that we mean ""Gallowboob is not against the rules"". Complaining about the OP rather than the content is an easy way to earn a temporary ban.

> ####The moderators reserve the right to remove posts & comments, and  to ban users at our own discretion. If we feel your post doesn't  fit, we'll remove it. If you are an abusive person, or an intolerable troll, we just might ban you. If you feel that your post or comment has been removed unfairly, **please feel free to message us.** We'll try to be nice. We're not perfect but we really are working on it.

>#### **If you see someone breaking the rules,** please [message the mods] (http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Finstant_regret) and let us know.

>#### Thanks! Now, please enjoy our sub and the consequences resulting from the poor choices made by your fellow humans.

reallifedoodles,9,"Hello, and welcome to Real Life Doodles!

Here we share doodles painted into every day life.

[](http://reallifedoodles.tumblr.com/#) [](https://www.instagram.com/realreallifedoodles/#)



[](https://www.reddit.com/r/reallifedoodles/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AMonthly%2BRequest%2BThread) [](https://www.reddit.com/r/reallifedoodles/search?q=flair%3AMod%2BPost&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)

#Rules

Mobile users or non-css users [click me!](https://www.reddit.com/r/reallifedoodles/about/rules/)

(Hover over rules for more in-depth information!)

###1. Doodles MUST be Original Content (OC)
1. Only post what you have created. If you did not create it, it will be removed
2. Do not post requests.  Submit requests as a comment in the stickied [official request thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/reallifedoodles/comments/6s8lvo/request_thread_please_make_all_requests_here/)  

###2. Formats & approved hosts
1. Original sources and final OC doodles must be an animated GIF (use reddit, imgur or gfycat; NOT Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.
2. Doodled photos and photo backgrounds with animations in them should be posted to r/StillLifeDoodles

###3. SFW content only
1. No doodling on genitalia or otherwise pornographic clips. Post them to r/glorp.
2. All sexualized imagery must be marked as NSFW. Mods reserve the right to flair any post.
3. Please flair all posts that pose a seizure risk or otherwise may have a non-traditional quality

###4. Posting, Reposting and Redoodling
1. Where possible, please provide a native, pre-doodled source in your post’s comments
2. Straight up reposting is not allowed, even if it is your own OC
3. OP may embellish and/or improve his or her own OC (please flair as “Redoodle""), as long as it has been at least five months since its debut.

###5. Mods reserve the right to remove any post
1. If your post technically meets the above requirements, yet should be posted elsewhere (such as r/GIFextra, r/TarantinoGIFs/, r/MichaelBayGIFs, r/SuperSaiyanGIFs, etc), the post may be removed without warning or explanation
2. No heavy or dominant usage of realistic FX plugins like smoke, fire, explosions, etc
3. Mods reserve the right to remove posts deemed to be low effort
4. Moderators do not need to explain the removal of any content

#HOW TO


The best way to make these gifs is using any program which can explode a gif out into multiple frames. Once you've got them split up you doodle on each frame to create the new gif (There is no real easy way to do this, it is a bit time consuming and you do have to draw on each frame)

The programs we know you can do this with are..

Flash, Photoshop, Gimp (There's a lot more but these are the main ones people are currently using, if you have any other suggestions for programs you can use message the mods and we'll add them to this list)

Thanks and have fun.

#Rules

1. **All submissions must be tagged with the appropriate link flair.** If you don't, our flair bot will automatically remove your post. [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/wiki/index#wiki_link_flair_guide) to learn how to flair your post.
2. **Be descriptive.** Posts containing fewer than 100 characters will be automatically removed. [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/wiki/index#wiki_submission_requirements) for more info.
3. **Use spoiler tags** (see below) and **no spoilers in titles**. If revealing spoilers is crucial to your post, do so in the body. We reserve the right to ban you if you do not follow this rule.
4. **NSFW posts are not allowed.** Explicit images, hentai, H-games, and other pornography are off-limits. Posts may recommend a work with NSFW scenes in it so long as nudity is not its focal point. [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/1gxz43/hentai_final_ruling/) for clarification.
5. **[Search](http://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/search?q=&restrict_sr=on) before you post.** Chances are if you liked something, someone else here has as well and has already made your request.
6. **No illegal content.** Consult [this list](/r/Animesuggest/wiki/legal_streams_and_downloads) to see which sites are allowed to post.
7. **Be positive.** Posts about why something should *not* be watched are discouraged. Posts about why someone's suggestion might not fit a request are okay, however, and are preferable to downvoting. Observe [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and follow Reddit's [rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules).
8. **""Watch This!"" posts must be a minimum of 1500 characters.** This is in an effort to cut down on low-effort posts. AutoModerator is set to handle this for us.
9. **No troll suggestions.** Do not give people troll suggestions. We reserve the right to ban you if you do not follow this rule.

#Accepted media
* Anime
* Manga
* Anime-inspired shows/films
* Light Novels (LN)
* Visual Novels (VN)

#Spoilers

**All spoilers must be tagged.** Here's how:

    [Anime Title](/s ""Spoiler text"")    
    [Anime Title](#s ""Spoiler text"")    

Both alternatives will show up as:

> [Anime Title](/s ""Spoiler text"")

*Example:*



>Ash's first pokémon is

>[Pokémon Ep. 1]\(/s ""Pikachu"")

*Will look like:*

>Ash's first pokémon is 

> [Pokémon Ep. 1](/s ""Pikachu"")

_____

Sometimes, the title itself might be a spoiler, in which cases it's okay to leave it blank or simply tag it as ""Spoiler"".

*Example:*

> >  **""**Anime where main characters die?**""**

> []\(/s ""Anime Title goes here"")

> [Spoiler]\(/s ""Anime Title goes here"")

*Will look like:*

> > **""**Anime where main characters die?**""**

> [](/s ""Anime Title goes here"")

> [Spoiler](/s ""Anime Title goes here"")

#Subreddit Rules

---

* No throwaway comments

* Comments must meet a general standard of quality determined by the moderators. All top level comments must be longer than simply a sentence or two, barring questions and some exceptions. Back up your opinions with details and examples. A comment should always further the discussion in some way, whether it be through adding onto the original post, contributing new information, offering an opposing viewpoint, etc.

---

* OP must get the discussion going

* Try to engage in intriguing conversation. Trivial and uninteresting threads may be deleted. New topics must aim to start a discussion. Posts should include in-depth questions and analytical opinions. Threads like ""I like band x, do you?"" or ""Help me get into band y"" don't belong here. ""DAE"" posts invite yes/no answers and do not stimulate discussion! If your contribution has been deleted and you feel peeved, feel free to let us know. Most removed posts can be resubmitted successfully by making the topic more discussion oriented.

---

* Some list threads are allowed

* List threads have grown popular here and have generated a lot of good discussion and content. We encourage list threads ONLY if they are in-depth and generate parent replies with quality content. You must also **tag your post** with '[list]' at the beginning of the title! Mods reserve the right to lock / remove any threads that they deem do not fit these criteria. Low-effort parent replies will be removed with extreme prejudice.

---

* No recommendation threads

* Unless there is a deeper level of discussion to the question, recommendation threads should be put in the general discussion post or in the chatroom.

---

* Provide links

* If you mention a song or an album in a comment, please take the time to add a Youtube link or a streaming playlist, so readers can easily check them out. Mentioning music without linking to the music is difficult for someone who is not familiar with it.

---

* No filesharing

* /r/letstalkmusic is not the place to solicit or post links to illegal music downloads. Filesharing is not allowed here!

---

* No Self-Promotion

* This isn't the place to promote yourself, your podcast, or your channel. If you have a blog post or essay, you may make a post with it, but you must include the entire contents of the post/essay in the post here. Users should not have to go to your website to join the conversation. Also, don't include a link to your blog etc.


---

* Be nice

* Direct insults to other members of the sub probably won't be tolerated. We mods aren't as touchy as some of you, but we'll use our own judgment.

---

###*Let the moderators know of any suggestions and complaints you have through moderator mail, not PM.*

#Subreddit Goals

##This is a community for people who are passionate about music. Here, stimulating, in-depth music discussions aren't rare.

##We would like to encourage posts that lead to heady discussions and lively debate. Assume your fellow contributors are somewhat cultured in music and are looking to write and read posts and comments that illuminate and challenge our ideas about music and the joy of listening to it.

#Album Discussion Club

##*Click the picture at the top of the page to join the conversation!* 

##Anyone is welcome to join our weekly album discussion club where we listen to and talk about our favorite albums and albums that are brand new to us. Official threads will be created by a moderator for weekly album discussion.

###[Album Discussion Club Archive](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/wiki/adc_archive)

#Weekly Threads

---

* What Have You Been Listening To?

* ""What Have You Been Listening To?""-threads are posted every Monday at 10:00am EST, and provide a platform to just talk about what music we've been listening to.

---

* General Discussion

* ""General Discussion""-threads are posted every Thursday at 10:00am EST, and are a free-for-all almost rule-free zone where we can talk about whatever without caring about our usual rules. **This is the place to ask for recommendations, discuss meta issues, and talk about anything that isn't worth a full post.**

#Quick Tips: Protect yourself first.

**GCX GOLDEN RULE:** A trader must comment on your GCX trading post before sending you a PM. Be sure to **check your post for the comment**. **[Many scammers can't comment.](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php)**
 
**CHECK THE USERNAMES** to make sure the username of the PM and comment match. **Check the account age**. Don't match? [***Message us immediately.***](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgiftcardexchange&amp;subject=Impersonator)
 
**SEARCH** usernames on **[The Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php)**. 

**INACTIVE ACCOUNTS** Click on their account profile. New account? No posts? Zero trading history? Don't trade!

---

#RULES: ESSENTIALS

1\. **GCX Golden Rule:** *Users must comment on GCX posts before sending a private message.*

2\. **Active Redditor:** *Redditors must meet age and activity requirements before posting, commenting, or trading, and only active redditors can be traded with. [See details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_2._active_redditor)* 

3\. **Last Word:** *Moderators may restrict a trade or user at their discretion. Mods reserve the right to restrict a user's posting privileges if a user refuses a request for information regarding the legitimacy of a trade or gift card.*

----

#RULES: Trade Restrictions

4\. **Trading Account balances over $250 in value** *is not permitted without prior approval. Spreading funds over multiple posts/comments does not get around this rule.* *[See details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_4._account_balance_restriction)*

5\. **Selling more than $250 on a single gift card or multiple gift cards** *is not permitted without prior approval. Spreading funds over multiple posts/comments does not get around this rule. Buyers should check the seller has approval if the cards exceed Rule 5 requirements.* *[See details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_5._more_than_.2499_restrictions)*

6\. **No cash for cash trades or account selling.** *This includes payment processors, cryptocurrency, prepaid credit/debit cards, and account credentials or otherwise accessing another account to complete an exchange.* *[See details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_6._trades_must_involve_gift_cards.)*

---

#RULES: Posting Rules

7\. **Post Title Format: [H] ""item"" [W] ""item""** *State what gift cards you're offering and their amounts in your title ([H]ave and [W]ant). You must specify the value of all gift cards you are offering in the title of your post. Incorrectly formatted posts will be removed.*

8\. **A user may post one thread per 24 hour period.** *Deleting your post does not get around this rule.*

9\. **User flair must be visible at ALL times.** *Report any users hiding their flair.*

10\. **Do not post a PSA.** *Send us a modmail.*

------

#RULES: Trader Conduct

11\. ``GCX Beginner`` flaired users are only allowed to ask for PayPal G&S or trade for another gift card. [See details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_11._payment_methods)

12\. **Be EXCELLENT to each other. Follow proper trading etiquette.** *Abusive, derogatory, or hostile speech directed at other users (including moderators) will not be tolerated. Do NOT interfere with other user's trades (""trade sniping""), or post your opinions of trade offers you aren't involved in.*

-----

#RULES: Subreddit Customs

13\.  **One confirmation per trade and only one confirmation per unique trader per 24 hours**: For example: if you buy $25 Amazon from a user in the morning and then $50 Amazon from that same user in the afternoon, it can only be confirmed once and add only +1 to your flair total. Also, every post can only contain 1 confirmation per pair of trade partners. If you sell someone $50 Amazon and confirm on a post and then sell that same person another $50 Amazon 48 hours later, you must make a new post to get credit for that trade. However, if you sell $50 Amazon to 2 different people you may confirm both trades on the same post.

14\. **Report all scams or suspicious behavior.** *[Use this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/faq#wiki_reporting_scammers.2Fsketchy_users) Your reports help prevent future scams and keep this subreddit safe.*

15\. **Do NOT PM the moderators.** *If you require moderator assistance, message the modmail.*

16\. **No reselling.** Do not re-sell gift cards or balances you obtained from any other exchange. This includes other gift card subreddits, crypto exchanges, or any other second hand gift card source. [See details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules#wiki_16._reselling_is_strictly_prohibited.).

17\. **Restricted Brands:** The moderation team monitors for gift card vulnerabilities that could lead to fraudulent activity with certain brands. These brands are restricted and will need to be verified prior to offering them for sale. [See details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/faq#wiki_restricted_brands)

#**[Cash Payment Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/cashpaymentmethods)**  

#####**GCX TRADING TIPS**

1\. Include a direct link to your GCX Rep Profile when you post, or when you comment on someone's post/PM them. It's a good first impression.

2\. If you want to avoid arguments, don't publicly post an offer that ""one ups"" another offer until the first offer is declined. This isn't against the rules to do, but it might annoy some people. Just comment that you PM'ed an offer to play it safe."

|||
|:------|:---|
|1. Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting.|
|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. ""This <thing>"" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|
|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|
|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned.|
|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|
|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|
|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|
|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|
----
#**Other things to note:**

* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.

* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.

* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.

* If you feel something violates the rules report it.

* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam. If you are a new reddit user, please gain some karma and wait before posting. This is to prevent spam and new users who don't understand reddit.

* Youtube links are currently auto filtered.

---|---
We're a subreddit for things that, surprisingly or interestingly, fit perfectly into each other.|And we'd love to have you join us. 
  
  
  


#**Rules (Hover for details)**



Rule | Description
---|---  
No porn.| There's other subreddits for that kind of thing, but this isn't one of them.  
No alignment screenshots or desktop screenshots.| These kinds of 2D screenshots are easy to manipulate and are generally low effort as well; try /r/juxtaposition or /r/screenshots for these kinds of fits. Fits in open-world games and other 3D environments are permitted.  
No artisan fits or pet fits.| /r/ArtisanVideos and /r/IfItFits are just a few of the numerous subreddits dedicated to these kinds of fits and would be more than happy to host these kinds of content.
No car doors or other easily movable objects.| Anything that can be moved into a perfect fit with a modicum of effort constitutes an unsurprisingly intentional fit as detailed below.
No tapered objects or containers.|Common examples of these would be  a cup in a cup or a ball in a cup, but they are defined as objects that would fit regardless if one object was bigger or smaller; however, tapered objects that only touch at their respective equators are acceptable. 
Reposts of recent posts or upper-level 'Top' posts will be flaired as such or removed.|No one likes seeing the same content again and again. This also includes compilation gifs/albums featuring mostly reposts or websites that are a collection of fits.
Exceedingly overused, unsurprisingly intentional, and/or low-effort fits are subject to strict removal.| Uninterestingly intentional fits and ""everyday fits"" (fits that use items such as bottles, caps, rings, tape, shelves, cabinets, lids, boxes, cans, jars, coins, any smaller common items, and any kind of liquid fits) are generally removed as they are usually both unsurprising and uninteresting.
Be nice, have fun and enjoy your stay. If you have any other suggestions for rules or ideas, [shoot us a message.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPerfectfit)|Do you love us? Hate us? Have an idea? Have a problem? Think your post has been removed? Whatever it is, let us know and we'll get right back to you. Remember, all-inclusive rules are impossible in a subreddit as subjective as this, but we do our best to ensure the best experience for everyone-- even if that means modifying or bending rules rules for exceptional posts.

**Comment Rules**
-
 **Keep it civil** - Do not personally insult other Redditors, or post discriminatory content. Constructive debate is good; [mockery, taunting, and name calling](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/6uriek/civility_taunting_and_mockery/) are not.

-
 **Do not submit low investment content** - This subreddit is for genuine discussion. Low effort content includes memes, unexplained links, sarcasm, and non-substantive contributions. 

-
**No meta discussion** - Conversation should be focused on the topic at hand, not on the subreddit, other subreddits, redditors, moderators, or moderation.  

-
**[Observe Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)**

-
**Warnings.** The rules are intended to maintain the high quality of the subreddit, and garden-variety violations will be met with a reminder from the moderators.

***Submission Rules***

New submissions will not appear until approved by a moderator.

**Wiki Guide:** [Tips On Writing a Successful Political Discussion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/wiki/posts)


Please observe the following rules:

-
**1. Submissions should be an impartial discussion prompt + questions.**

* Keep it civil, no political name-calling.

* Do not ask [loaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question) or [rhetorical questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question).

* No personal opinions/proposals or posts designed to support a certain conclusion. Either offer those as a comment or post them to r/PoliticalOpinions.

**2. Provide some background and context. Offer substantive avenues for discussion.**

* Avoid highly speculative posts, all scenarios should within the realm of reasonable possibility.

* Do not request users help you with an argument, educate you, or perform research for you.

* No posts that boil down to: DAE, ELI5, CMV, TIL, AskX, ""Thoughts?"", ""Discuss!"", or ""How does this affect the election?""

**3. Everything in the post should be directly related to a political issue.**

* No meta discussion about reddit, subreddits, or redditors.

* Potentially non-politics: Law, sociology, philosophy, celebrities, news, etc.

* We are not a link subreddit. Don't just post links to news, blogs, surveys, videos, etc.

**4. Formatting and housekeeping things:**

* The title should match the post. Don't use tags like `[Serious]`

* Check to make sure another recent post doesn't already cover that topic.

* Don't use all-caps. Format for readability: paragraphs, punctuation, and link containers.

**RULES AND GUIDELINES**

* **DO** use the search function. Are you interested in what everyone thinks of [Season 9](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/search?q=Season+9&restrict_sr=on) or why the music is different on [Netflix](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/search?q=Netflix&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)? These questions have been asked a ton of times. 

* **DO** use your own discretion with spoilers, especially with titles. If a user says they're still watching the show for the first time then please use spoiler tags when necessary:`>!text goes here!<`, ex: >!text goes here!<.  

* **DO NOT** Post your personal text, facebook, DM, etc conversations. They will be removed. 

* **DO NOT** use hate speech/slurs or use personal attacks.

* **DO NOT** Post animated gifs, please just submit the video link from YouTube or upload to [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com/) or use imgur .gifv. GIFs take larger bandwidth over video formats.

* **DO NOT** Comment with just ""There is no Season 9"" These comments will be deleted, they add nothing to the discussion. There are people who want to discuss Season 9/Med School.

* **DO** stay on topic. Posting social media updates from the cast that do not relate to the show will be removed. This is not /r/ZachBraff. Social media posts from the actors that are about the show are more than welcome. Posting things that vaguely relate to the show may be removed if blatantly off topic. 

* **DO NOT** Post about outside news or US or World politics. [Let's keep it about the show and not what's happening in the real world.](https://youtu.be/UOnu7q3xaC8?t=1m22s) 

* **YOU CAN** post photos you've taken with the crew, but please post a comment giving a little back story, what was the person like, how'd you meet them, etc.

reactiongifs,4,"######

###Reaction?

A reaction gif is a physical or emotional response that is captured in an animated gif **which you can link in response to someone or something on the Internet.** The reaction must not be in response to something that happens within the gif, or it is considered a ""scene."" For example:  
  
* [Scene.](http://i.imgur.com/eFlYEsc.gifv)  
* [Reaction 1.](http://i.imgur.com/3ODbnTM.gifv)  
* [Reaction 2.](http://i.imgur.com/vOOMz3F.gifv)

######

###Rules

1. Your gif must actually contain some sort of reaction. Your submission title has no bearing on whether the gif you submit is a reaction gif or not. Non-reactions and analogies will be removed.
2. Upvote, downvote, inbox and reddit gold gifs are not allowed and will be removed. Please direct your submission to /r/upvotegifs or /r/goldgifs.
3. If you submit a gif that is submitted often or was submitted recently, it may be removed. If you're reusing a gif, try to come up with an original title—a new angle.
4. Please direct your cake day posts to /r/cakeday.  Cakeday posts are not allowed in any form.
5. Individual gifs only and link directly to the gif. A direct link ends in one of the following: .JPG .JPEG .PNG .GIF .GIFV .MP4 .WEBM
6. No gore or porn/nudity.
7. You must use an appropriate host listed below for your gif.
8. Let me make this clear: If you make [OC] and you want [OC] Flair, you gonna have to tag that shit [OC] in the title, capisce?
9. The rules are the rules.  Deal with it like an adult.  Don't mention or complain about rules or mod teams of any subreddit.
10. Keep comments civil.   Personal attacks, racism, bigotry, homophobia, etc is not tolerated and will result in a ban, even if you think you are just joking.
11. No spoilers.  Do not post spoilers for current media. Use spoiler tags when discussing any recent shows or movies.
12. Do not engage in witch hunts or brigades. reddit is not your personal army.
13. We do not allow participation of users from hatereddits that ban due to actions in other subreddits.

####Rules

**This is just an overview. [The full rules in detail are here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/about/rules/) Please read them!**

These are in addition to reddit's [site-wide rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).

* All posts must be directly related to *Gravity Falls*, and SFW. It should be easy to tell that your post is GF-related without looking at the title.

* Avoid linking to any sites that make money from hosting the episodes.

* Do not post links to leaked information.

* Avoid submitting memes or other very low-effort content posts, and do not spam emotes.

* Do not spam the subreddit with huge amounts of posts at once. We recommend **no more than 5 posts every 10 hours**.

To spoiler-tag a link, click ""tag as a spoiler"" underneath the link after submitting it.

To hide a spoiler in a comment, format it like so:

`[spoiler goes here](#spoiler)`

It will look like this: [spoiler goes here](#spoiler)

pettyrevenge,10,"##Rules:

1. **Do not ask for help to enact some sort of petty revenge!  This includes telling a story and ending with ""What would you have done?"", ""What are your thoughts?"", ""Any other ideas?""  All direct and indirect requests for ideas will result in a ban.**

2. ***Stories*** should be **revenge**-based. **Karma =/= Revenge** Someone has wronged you, but you got your revenge, oh yes, you got your revenge. (If you have planned a revenge and need feedback, might I direct you to /r/myevilplan?)  Reporting someone to the an authority like the police is **not** revenge, it is simply just reporting someone to an authority.

3. ""You"" does not have to be you personally; posts relating to your friends, or good stories elsewhere on the internet, are fair game, as long as you're clear whose story it is.

4. ***Stories*** should be **petty**. I messed with their toothpaste. I turned their disk upside-down in their XBox. I *gasp* put shaving cream in their shoes. The more creative the better, (If you have a not so-petty revenge, post it in /r/prorevenge!)

5. ***Stories*** should **not** be serious. No: murder, rape, assault, grand theft (*petty* theft acceptable), or any other felonies.  **NO VANDALISM.**

6. ***Stories*** should be true. If a claim seems impossible or probably false, you will be asked for proof.

7. Racism, sexism, and other bigotry will not be tolerated, either in posts or in comments.

8. No identifying information (stay in compliance with [all Reddit's rules](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq)).

9. NSFW posts should be labeled as such. NSFL posts probably aren't petty, but if you have a weird exception, label it appropriately.

10. No flame wars. Seriously, why do I have to specify this? Keep it classy, people!

11. No comments with the purpose of telling OP to x-post the post to another subreddit, **the comment will be removed**, send him/her a PM instead.  (This includes comments and/or statements similar to ""This is borderline <blank>"", ""/r/<blank>"", or ""If you would've <blank> it would've been <blank>"", or ""/r/<blank> would love this"")

Have a story of a revenge gone wrong? post it in /r/backfiredrevenge!

Or have a malicious story with or without revenge? post it in /r/badpeoplestories!

All posts not in compliance with the rules will be removed. Posts that are resubmitted without asking permission will result in a ban.

Sometimes posts get lost just send a modmail do not send a PM directly."

Posts should be made to inform or facilitate discussion. Any post with the intent to self-promote, sell products or services, or are appeals for money / funding will most likely be removed.

Do not post pictures of text here, they will be removed. NO MEMES. This type of content should be posted in /r/AudioMemes.

Similarly, office pics are generally considered low-effort fluff, image posts should have some point other than karma and promote discussion

###Want more posts with just OC? Try using the [FILTER](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/search?q=OC&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all).

Please include text recipes in your comments, if possible. 

**Submission Rules**

**Rule 1 - Posts Must Be Food-Related**

* As r/FoodPorn is a food photography subreddit, all posts and comments must relate, in some way, to food photography. Any comments or posts that are hateful, rude, or antagonizing will be removed and the user may be banned at the mod’s discretion.

**Rule 2 - Only Submit Single Images and Gifs**

* Gif's are only allowed as long as they comply with the rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/4nc3m0/rfoodporn_now_allows_gifs/).

* Videos, collections, interactive images/websites, and articles are not allowed.

**Rule 3 - Include Context in the Title**

* Include some context in the title (including the name of the food, not just the type of meal e.g. lunch). All non-OC must credit the content creator in the title. 
* If it is your image, please place an [OC] tag in the title. We also offer [OC] flair for users to flair their content. 
* If it is non-OC, use the “credit: content creator“ tag and include the name of the content creator.  

* Low effort titles will be removed. Please try and describe what's in your photo the best you can (e.g. ""Dim Sum Lunch"" or ""Antipasto with parma ham, olives, gruyere cheese, and breadsticks"").

**Rule 4 - One Non-Original Post Per Day**

* You may only post one non-original content post per day. A ""non-OC post"" is a photograph (or gif) that you did not create yourself.

**Rule 5 - Recipes should be in plain text**

* We do not require posts to include a recipe, however we do strongly encourage it. If you decide to include a recipe it must be posted in plain text in the comments section. You are free to link to off-site recipes, but there must always be a plain text version in a comment, if there is to be any recipe at all.

**Rule 6 - Civil Comments only**

* Please remember the human and keep your comments civil.

#[Rules](/r/SquaredCircle/wiki/rules)
Rule | Description
:--|:--
**Our Mission Statement** | [Clear rules](/r/SquaredCircle/wiki/rules) that help give the subreddit a balance of content. -- In addition please follow [redditquette](/wiki/reddiquette) and reddit's site-wide [rules](/rules). 
**Spoiler Policy** | No spoilers in titles for 24 hours after a show has aired. -- If your post contains spoilers put the tag [SPOILERS] at the START of your title and the show title.
**Posts must be about wrestling**|""All link posts must be directly related to wrestling. Any link post not featuring wrestling itself, or in relation to a wrestling show or the wrestling industry, is subject to removal. 
**No image posts that are:** |memes/image macros i.e. an image with text on it done for comedic effect or with slight variation for the sake of a cheap laugh (if it can be found on /r/AdviceAnimals it doesn't belong here) or observations better suited to a text post.
**Don't reply as a new post** | If you want to fix someone's post, or have a better example of what's been posted, tell us so in the comments, not by making a new post!
**No spam** |Only link to your own content if you contribute to the community.
**Reposts and vague titles** | Obvious reposts and titles that are overly ambiguous will be deleted at the moderators' discretion. (e.g. ""This Guy""). Reposts generally follow a 120 day rule except for posts in our [Hall of fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/hvgchm/hall_of_fame_posts_induction_1_explanation_of/)
**No Low-Effort Content** | Low-effort, single image **link posts**, including but not limited to, screenshots, crude photoshops, and MS paint-style artwork, are subject to removal. However, these may be posted as a self post with a description of the content.
**No ""Plot""/Sexual Content** | Posts focused on sexual content will be removed.
**[Meta] posts** | Posts or submissions about the community itself are allowed as long as they follow the general rules of Squared Circle.
**Text posts** | A text post should have sufficient text in its body to either strengthen the title, create discussion or add more information. Any posts posted seemingly for no reason but to bait, troll, or otherwise antagonize the community can and will be removed at the mods discretion.
**No Fake News**  |/r/SquaredCircle has a very strict policy towards troll rumors (fake injury reports, releases, etc.) and those responsible for posting them are subject to being banned.
**Moderator Discretion** | At any time the moderators will use discretion on any given rule. If they feel it's significant or unique to be up despite the rules. On the other hand, they also reserve the right to remove any post they feel breaks the rules. All of this can of course be appealed by messaging us.

DestructiveReaders,8,"##[Click To Hide Leeches](#header)



# Raison d'être

The goal: to improve writing and maintain the highest standard of critique excellence anywhere on Reddit.

DestructiveReaders isn't about writers being nice to writers; it's about readers being honest with writers. We deconstruct writing to construct better writers. 


# Getting Started

Please read the rules below, and take a look at the **[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/wiki/faq)** and **[New User thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/291jo6/new_visitors_please_read_%CA%85%CA%83/)**. 

# Assuring Quality & Rules



###&#9660; Rules & Guidelines &#9660;

* **PLEASE VIEW OUR SUB ON OLD.REDDIT.com/r/DestructiveReaders ON DESKTOP**
* This sub is dedicated to the blunt assessment of writing. Do not submit a story if you react poorly to potentially harsh feedback. 
* Before submitting work, please read the welcome sticky and provide at least one [‘high effort’ critique](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/wiki/critique) of a story that has (in total) the same word count as the piece you submit. Failure to do so will result in the application of a leech tag, and in 12 hours, the post will be removed. NOTE: Critiques can be banked, but expire after 3 months. Google Doc comments are not considered part of a high effort critique. Please read the ENTIRE sidebar section on ""leeching"" before submission. 
* **SUBMISSION RULES**: The title of posts must begin with the [word count](https://wordcounter.net/) in square brackets: **[Word count] Insert title here**. No rough drafts or unedited work. 
* When critiquing, do *not* engage in personal attacks or leave criticism without merit. Keep it explicitly about the writing. Please read our **[guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/wiki/critique#wiki_a_quick_recap_of_our_community.27s_guidelines_when_it_comes_to_critiquing_on_google_docs.3A)** for critiquing on Google docs, and leave the doc readable for other members. 
* Submitting? Please link your critique(s) so the mods and community can judge the merit. If you don't, the community may assume you are a leech. 
* All top-level (non-critique) comments on submissions will be removed. Use the report button instead of telling someone to critique.  
* You must wait at least two days between submissions, and we suggest limiting your word count to ~2500. Do not post already published work. 
* While not a rule, we prefer Google Docs submissions. Privacy Alert: Google attaches your G+ account to your submissions. If you value privacy, use a throwaway email.




###&#9660; What is the red leech mark? &#9660;
* A leech is someone who takes without giving. The community would fall apart if everyone just dumped their writing and left. Most users here ignore leeches entirely.
* A leech post will appear faded with CSS enabled. The button on the sidebar [HIDE LEECH] does exactly that.
* If users are concerned about not critiquing a leech, we recommend they only critique submissions over 5 hours old. It is also recommended to focus critiques on posts no older than ~3 days (often abandoned/rewritten).
* Once marked, you have 12 hours to meet the 1:1 ratio. If you submit a 1000 word story, critique a 1000 word story. (Or two 500 word stories.) For larger word counts, we require sometimes 2:1 or even 3:1. After 12 hours, the post is removed and you will be unable to resubmit for 2 days.
* Effort goes further than experience here. ""I'm new!"" isn't an excuse. 
* ""High effort"" is a dynamic/scaling concept. The critique standards for a 3.5k submission are much higher than a 1k submission. Mods will probably demand multiple critiques to approve higher word counts.
* Example: five 1k critiques doesn't earn a large 5k submission. Mods rarely want to combine your critiques for full value above 2.5k. We prefer you split your submissions up under 3.5k maximum (and wait 48 hours to submit in pieces). For higher counts, ALL of your chosen critiques will need to be extremely quality and of similar word counts to your submission. 4k is a cultural soft cap, but not a rule. We judge under increasing pressure, like water VS aluminum cans. 
* Line edits are very welcome in Google docs, [but do not count towards the 1:1 ratio.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/6cnrvb/meta_line_editing_is_not_critiquing/) Critiques that copy-paste large sections of writing just to make trivial edits will be regarded as low quality.

**[Rules and posting guidelines:](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/about/rules/)**

1. All posts must be flaired ""Wilderness"" or ""Travel""

2. Submissions must include a short paragraph describing your trip. Submitted content should be of high-quality. Low effort posting of very general information is not useful. Posts must include a trip report of at least 150 characters or a short paragraph with trip details.

3. This is a community of users, not a platform for advertisement, self promotion, surveys, or blogspam. [Acceptable Self-Promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) means at least participating in non-commercial/non-self promotional ways more often than not. 

4. All photos and videos must be Original Content

5. Be courteous and civil. Polite, constructive criticism of ideas is acceptable. Unconstructive criticism of individuals and usage of strong profanity is unacceptable.

6. Follow [Rediquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).  

If you have any questions, or are unsure whether something is ok to post, feel free to [contact the moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbackpacking)

In addition to reddit's global rules, /r/creepy enforces the following:




**1\. NOT CREEPY DON'T POST IT!** Insufficiently creepy submissions will be removed at moderator's discretion. Generally speaking, if it can work as a post on a comedy or a cute subreddit, it doesn't belong here. Abandoned buildings without a creepy context will be directed elsewhere.   

If a post is *completely* off topic, please report the post and [**message the mods.**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcreepy)

**2\. Do NOT complain ""That's not creepy!""** in the comments or in post titles. Defamation of the subreddit itself and those who disregard the sidebar rules will be banned permanently. As a counterbalance against rule #2, keep in mind that different people are creeped out by different things, and suspension of disbelief helps the atmosphere. Just downvote and move on, or upstage them by [**submitting something even creepier.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/submit ""You know you want to."") You'll notice the loudest complainers never actually submit anything good themselves. The health of any subreddit depends on users like you submitting quality content and the community voting wisely.

**3\. No pictures of costumes, makeup, or children's art.** From October 1-31 there will be a ""Halloween Megathread"" where the costume rule will be lifted in said thread. However comments will be closely monitored.

**4\. No memes, religious discussions, or politics.** Post content of that nature in their specific subreddits, this place isn't for comedy it's not a church or a place to discuss politicians.  
 
**5\. If your submission is NSFW, use the NSFW tag.** If your submission is just gore without a creepy context, please take it to [r/WTF](https://old.reddit.com/r/WTF/)


**6\. No imgur gallery links!**  Instead, use direct imgur image links or album links (http://i.imgur.com/EXAMPLE.png or http://i.imgur.com/a/EXAMPLE instead of http://imgur.com/gallery/EXAMPLE, for example) as they're easier for mobile and RES users to open. 

**7\. No Comment Spam.** Take the I took an arrow to the knee or hell in a cell comments elsewhere. If you persist with said comments you will receive a 3 day ban as a warning. 

* If you see any rule violations, please [**message the mods**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcreepy) and we'll look into it as soon as possible. Please include a link of the 
comment or submission in question, as this makes it much easier for
the moderation team to handle the issue.

**8\. No Videos** Video content belongs in /r/videos that means no YouTube submissions or V.reddit posts. We do however accept Gfycat gifs and Imgur gifs if linked properly.

A subreddit for propaganda collectors, enthusiasts, or anyone fascinated by propaganda as an insight into history, sociology, perspective, and manipulation.

Posters, paintings, leaflets, cartoons, videos, music, broadcasts, news articles, or any medium is welcome - be it recent or historical, subtle or blatant, artistic or amateur, horrific or hilarious. 

Guidelines
===

1) Don't vote on whether you agree with the message of a post.

2) Don't post with the intent to spread propaganda you agree with or the intent to degrade propaganda you disagree with.

3) Titles must have a date and must be neutral. If in doubt, you can simply use the caption of the poster (eg. *""I want you!"", US, 1917*).

4) No current events. To help us to be objective, posts cannot be from within the last two years. Please post contemporary work on  /r/ModernPropaganda.

5) Civil conversation is okay; soapboxing, bigotry, partisan bickering, and personal attacks are not.

6) No memes or clickbait. Image macros are only allowed if released by an official agency and the source is provided.

For a complete rundown and explanation of the rules, refer to [the wiki](/r/PropagandaPosters/wiki/index).

**6. Discussion of Illegal Activity** is permitted; however, such behavior is not endorsed by /r/Cruise. Use common sense.

**7. Explicit sexual content** is not permitted on /r/Cruise. Posts discussing sexual topics are permitted *so long as the discussion is relevant to other cruisers.* Please ensure you tag any such content as ""NSFW"" before posting.

**8. Political Discussion** is only allowed to the extent it is relevant to cruising. Harassment, threats, and political trolling are never allowed. COVID-related discussion and debate is allowed, but misinformation is not.

**9. Special Flair** (e.g. cruise line employee flair, travel agent flair, etc.) are assigned at the discretion of the mod team. If you would like to receive special flair  feel free to [contact us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCruise) and we will see what we can work out.

yoyhammer,9,something_wrong_with_this_subreddit
GamePhysics,1,"#About:


A subreddit for game engines at their best and worst. This means games with up and coming tech and games that are glitching out in hilarious ways.

*Please note: Submissions do not necessarily have to be physics related, but please check the top posts to understand the spirit of the subreddit.*

#Rules:

* Post the game's name in [brackets] at the beginning of your title  
* No generic highlights of something *cool* done in game.
* Source the video your gif is from. If you did not record the clip yourself and found it on another site before uploading it to reddit (i.e. YouTube, Twitch, etc) you **must** post the source. Give credit to the creator.
* If you report a link, please message the mods a link to the comments section as well as the reason you reported the link.  
* Don't repost something if it's been posted within the last 2 months. If you're unsure if something's already been posted, search for the game name in the search bar. Popular old reposts (i.e. Uncharted 4 shale physics, BF1 zeppelin firenado, Skyrim intro with FPS too high etc) will be removed. If a bug remains unfixed, still occurs in an identical fashion/location **and** is regularly posted by users it will be considered to be too common and any second clip featuring this bug posted within the rolling two month period will be removed. For the full list consult the ""list of overly common bugs"" at the bottom of the sidebar. 
* x-posts are allowed, but please tag it with [x-post from (subreddit)]. 
* [Recent update to the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamePhysics/comments/344le5/mod_announcements/)
* Please try to only submit Youtube, Imgur, or Gfycat links otherwise your post might get caught in the spam filter.
* INDIE DEVELOPER RULES:
If you are an indie developer with a WORK IN PROGRESS, you may only submit one post during that stage of development. Other users may not submit any posts of your WIP after this point either. If your game is RELEASED, you may again only submit one post for this stage. You are required to indicate that the game is released in the comments, with proof provided. Released titles can be freely posted by other users but any further dev posts at this stage will be treated as advertisement and removed.
* All submissions must either be glitches or demonstrate notable physics, either of the good variety or bad. If the game's engine is performing normally then your submission is NOT appropriate. Effectively, if your submission pertains to something mundane that happens during standard gameplay it is not acceptable. 
* The same user may only submit posts from the same game twice per week. So, for instance if a user posts a Far Cry clip on Monday and then Tuesday they cannot submit another Far Cry clip until the next week. They can, however, post a Fallout clip on Wednesday.
* Do not post funny/dumb NPC moments (i.e. ""it must have been the wind"" type clips). These are AI issues and have nothing to do with glitches or the physics engine. Pathfinding issues where the AI can't figure out how to correctly navigate the environment (walking/driving into walls, running in circles, etc) are not appropriate. The exception to this is if the NPC is being funny in the middle of a collision/physics glitch (for example: they are spaghettifying but also casually talking still).
* Submissions involving mods will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking, the bar is significantly higher for post approval than with standard submissions. If a glitch organically occurs as a result of altering game files, that is fine. Something simple like ""dial up the acceleration"" on collision to send objects flying on its own is not acceptable. The submission must showcase something truly exceptional and interesting that pushes a game engine well outside of its normal bounds--for instance, adding destruction physics when there wasn't any previously. As such, approval or removal of these submissions is at moderator discretion.
* For the health of the sub, any low effort posts (phone recordings, image posts showing very minor bugs such as T-poses, low quality screencaps/images/videos where it is difficult to tell what is happening, etc) will be removed. This rule also encompasses submissions showcasing physics for games that specifically focus on or are designed around that particular physics simulation/aspect (i.e. simple destruction in Teardown, car crashes in Beam NG, building destruction in Battlefield), with the exception of unreleased games showcasing new tech or interesting physics--indie dev rules still apply here, of course. Whenever possible, please use proper recording software or screen capture abilities. These are built into all current and last gen consoles with companion apps often being able to upload to reddit from your phone and PCs have many options.
* Non-exhaustive list of things that will typically be removed nearly without exception: simple texture bugs, audio bugs, minor graphical bugs, issues from graphics cards dying, network/server issues (such as lag, high ping, or desync), examples of intentional game design intended to save memory or increase performance such as 2D structures outside the playable area, image post submissions--this sub is for videos and gifs not screenshots, and for the first two months after a game's release any extremely common bugs that are found to affect most playthroughs in exactly the same way (i.e. Cyberpunk window launch) will be treated as reposts of the first discovery and removed. 
* Overly common bug list: Assassin's Creed III ""happy ending"" bug, Assassin's Creed vsync haystack bug, Cyberpunk window launch, Cyberpunk Panam bike teleport launch, Stray picture clipping bug, Sea of Thieves ship launch, RDR2 bridge glitch, GTA V upside down bike flying.  

#Guidelines:

* If you need a gif made, be sure to visit /r/Makemeagif! Just pick your favorite scene from a video, someone will gif it, and you can post it here for easily digestible fun.  
* Try to host on imgur or gfycat
* No advice animals. 
* Self-post discussions are more than welcome!

nevertellmetheodds,7,"#[Sir, the probability of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately...](https://streamable.com/z9dm)

##[**Never tell me the odds?**](http://i.imgur.com/7FpOzqj.gifv)

##RULES

1. Submissions must be nearly impossible feats of achievement, those requiring incredible odds and/or a great degree of difficulty. Posts based entirely around skill and/or persistence, including deliberate tricks and stunts, are not allowed.



2. Do not mention odds or probabilities anywhere, in the post title or comments.

3. Do not repost content that's been posted here within the past 6 months or is in our Top 50 of All Time. Moderators maintain discretion and final approval on all submissions

4. Faked and easy-to-fake posts are prohibited - no r/untrustworthypoptarts

5. **NO SCREENSHOTS** 

6. Direct image and gif submissions only, content must be hosted at imgur, gfycat or reddit. youtube.com submissions are not allowed

7. No hate speech of any kind. No witch-hunts, brigading or harassment

8. Be nice. Follow the [site rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). 

9. Please mark your posts as NSFW when appropriate.

10. Digital juxtaposition posts that are not incredibly rare or odds defying will be removed. Try /r/Juxtaposition for those types of posts. If your post is something like ""these posts lined up in my feed"" you will be given a 2 week ban.

##LIST OF COMMON POSTS THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED ON THIS SUB

This list may be modified in the future

* 1: Receipts or anything related to monetary balances.

Gas prices, change amounts, receipt balances, money left in bank account, etc.

* 2: Four Leaf clovers (or greater)

We've seen multiple posts of 4, 5, 6, and 7 leaf clovers. They are not as rare as they sound, and many people even have collections of them.

* 3: Fortune Cookie fortunes

This includes posts such as: Identical fortunes, multiple fortunes in one cookie, and other related posts. These also fall under Rule 4

* 4: Car mileage and other related gauges

At some point, it's just more impressive that some cars even make it to 123,456 miles, but not odds defying.

This also includes licence plates which have consecutive numbers. Despite this seemingly being rare, we get several of these posts a month.

* 5: Hitting a dart with another dart

It's relatively easy with good aim and practice. Also, these posts are almost always pictures, which would fall under Rule 4.

* 6: Eggs with multiple yolks

These also fall under Rule 4.

* 7: /r/BreathingInformation style posts

* 8: Images of things that are shaped like other things

* 9: Defective products, including packages of candy or snacks that are all one color

* 10: People wearing similar clothing, or wearing clothing with a pattern that matches some other pattern (such as the pattern on a bus seat)"

##Our Posting Policy: 

__Treat the other readers with courtesy and respect.__ It is okay to offend people on r/knives, but it isn't okay to put any effort into it.    

* If you really need to offend somebody then send them a private message and settle it outside.    

* Be helpful, polite, and welcoming to knife newbies. Beginners are friends, not food.    

* Posts about self-defense are not allowed here - r/MartialArts is a more appropriate place for these discussions.    

__No Spam!__ It's OK to share the things you've made or a cool new product you've discovered, but this isn't the place to market products or web sites. Even the pros deserve to have a place where they can just hang out and be hobbyists again. It can be a fine line sometimes, but try to stay on the non-commercial side of it. 

* Ads, promotions, product announcements, giveaways, AMAs, kickstarters, and links to self-owned businesses, facebook pages and blogs will usually be removed. _It's OK to promote a thing you love and the hobby you enjoy, but it's not OK to promote yourself or your business interest._    

* If you've made a knife and you're proud of it, post it. Do not post pricing or ordering information. 

* Links to self-owned youtube videos are allowed at moderator discretion; on-topic, sincere user content is welcome. Posts are more likely to be removed if they are originate from accounts used to frequently post self-owned links, or which cross the line into promotion of commercial products or of the channel itself. Product reviews, new product announcements, knifemaking videos, and anything beginning with ""This week's episode"" are especially unlikely to survive.

This subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.

#RULES:

# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine attempt at an answer

All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed.

Please do not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should ""google it."" Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself. Users are coming to NSQ for straightforward, simple answers or because of the nuance that engaging in conversation supplies. LMGTFY links will be removed.

No responses being rude to the questioner for not knowing the answer. 

Exceptions: 

- On-topic follow up questions are allowed. 

- Link only answers permitted if the question happens to be ""What is a good subreddit for...?""

#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question

Try to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).

#Rule 3: Follow reddiquette 

Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.

Check out the [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) page for more info - violations of any of those of clauses may result in a ban without warning. 

# DISALLOWED QUESTION AREAS

These types of questions are not allowed and will be removed:

- Medical advice questions

- Trolling or joke questions

- Suicide related questions.  Such questions are best handled by the great resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.

- Questions along the lines of ""was I raped?"" or ""was I sexually assaulted?"" are best addressed by the trained, professional support resources you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/wiki/resources#wiki_rape_and_sexual_violence) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/about/sidebar). 
 
- Getting people to view your product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question

- Illegal things - nothing like ""Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?"" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.

- Tasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.

- Other questions not asked in good faith - such as putting a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question. Any questions we suspect of being leading questions or asked merely to promote an agenda or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) will be removed."

* [Properly label all spoiler posts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AkameGaKILL/wiki/guidelines)
* Do not put spoilers in the title of your post. 
* Post the original source first. Avoid using aggregate sites that rip in low quality. I suggest the [Scanlator's site](http://mangastream.com/) or [Batoto](http://www.batoto.net/comic/_/comics/akame-ga-kill-r219).
* All content must relate to Akame Ga Kill.
* Chapter and anime discussions will be posted by moderators.

* Do not [self promote](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).
* Do not post memes.
* Do not post links to non-authorized streaming sites or torrents.
* Do not post requests for fan-art or wallpapers. /r/Animewallpaper is a more suitable forum for this. 
* Source your content if you are not the original creator.
* Do not post requests for information that is already located in the sidebar.

* The manga releases toward the end of the month (around the 22nd).

* The Anime breaks off from the Manga at **~chapter 36**.

* Yes, you should read the manga and yes you should start from the beginning.

* Will the anime ever get a second season? The answer is no. The anime left zero room for a continuation. The most we can hope for is for another studio to take a crack at it after the Manga finishes in a few years.

Welcome to /r/EatCheapAndHealthy !!

**Rules of Engagement**

> **Remember, we come from a varied and diverse background, and all of us have different perceptions of what cheap and healthy means. There is no one right way to eat for all people and all budgets, and there is always room for improvement. Please keep things cordial and respectful, and if you think you have a better set of recipes, lead by example and post them! This means you are not allowed to tell people their content is not healthy, period.**


Post your freezing, canning, recipes and ideas for people to eat both cheap and healthy. 

> **PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SUBMISSION RULES:**

> **1** **All links or image posts must include a formatted recipe.**

> **2** **No direct links except to imgur.com and youtube.com** 

> **3** If you want to post a link to a website, you can use the **SELF POST** option and leave the formatted recipe along with an embedded link in the text box.

> **4** All posts, and comments must follow reddiquette and self promotion guidelines. We monitor things a bit loose here, but will step in without regard if the content does not fit our sub theme or violates site guidelines. No polls, surveys, research for school, no ads, limited self promotion, etc. Please be positive, constructive criticism is welcome but being mean is not. See our rules of engagement mantra for clarification. This also means that any arguments of dietary restrictions are not allowed, no matter which side you argue for. Nobody has time for that drama.

**Please be constructive with your comments! If you have a healthier option, please post that instead of discourse.**

* moderators will remove comments or users who just sow discourse and do not add to the healthy discussions. It's just food but to some people, the recipes, images, discussions and interactions here can help them to get to a better place in their personal lives. We use reddiquete as a rule here and not just a good idea. 

**Please help us grow the community.**

* While we encourage new content we also want the bloggers and people who just post external links to interact with the community.

# Rules



1. **No hate speech & no slap fights.** Open debate is welcome, but be civil and do not resort to personal attacks or insults regardless of how much you may disagree with the other person.

2. **Posts must depict humans actually being bros.** Please do not post humans engaging in normal human behavior which might simply appeal to humans.

3. **No reliance on additional context.**  The 'bro' action should be easily discernible within the image/gif/video. Having to add context in the title, comments, super-imposed text or otherwise to explain the 'bro' is against sub rules.  Submissions violating this rule will be removed

4. **No reposts.** All reposts are removed at moderators discretion.  Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban.  Check the sub prior to posting to see if your submission has already been posted

5.  **NSFW content.** NSFW content is sometimes okay here, but it must be flagged appropriately.  We do not allow any content related to suicide, or suicide prevention.  No rage bait submissions.

8. **No memes, comics, or compilations.** Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.

10. **No spreading misinformation.** Sharing a source and debating that source or topic in a fair and reasonable manner (i.e., without personal attacks) is encouraged. Do not make wildly unsubstantiated and/or outlandish claims without the ability to share a source.

11. **No posts or comments directly about politics and no bringing politics into a post or comment not about politics.  No war related content.  No posts centered around police**

12.  **No text only submissions.** This includes screenshots of text messages, twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Reddit screenshots from other communities will be reviewed on a case by case basis.  Images of text are prohibited.  This includes:  cards, letters, notes. Do not post links to Reddit posts from other communities

13. **No slurs, harassing or trolling comments.  No racial slurs or sexually inappropriate comments. No hate speech.** This includes comments implying the animal in the image/gif is food, or will be eaten. Jokes about animals being food are not welcome.

forearmporn,6," 
##Welcome

This is the place to appreciate forearms in a friendly environment. We want to encourage everyone to enjoy themselves and try and make r/forearmporn enjoyable for everybody else too. Make sure you remember to upvote any forearms that catch your eye, compliments are always encouraged. If however, you see something that violates any of the rules listed below before we do, you're welcome to report it and we will investigate.


## Rules 
   
1. NO DICKS at all - This means no visible penis is allowed in photos posted here. Keep it in your pants. There are hundreds of other subs where you can post your penis, bulges, or other cock-topics. This sub is for forearms.

2. Forearm focus - It should go without saying, but do try to make forearms the focus of your picture. Obviously the extra details like a little bit of torso or other body part that isn't a visible cock is a nice bonus as a background, but your forearm(s) should be the standout feature.

3. Over 18s only - If you aren't 18 or older, you do not have permission to post or comment here. Photos posted must be of adult men only.

4. Be nice - If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.

5. No crossposts/Original content only - We know this used to be allowed but from now on please only post pictures directly onto the subreddit. Any photos posted that aren't of you will be removed, even if they aren't crossposted.

6. No personal information - Don't share your Snapchat, Kik or anything else that might compromise your anonymity.

7. No spamming - This means to not post more than twice a day, and to not keep posting the same picture over and over again. It's important to keep things fresh and give the community a variety of different forearms to look at, not just yours.

8. Don't ask for upvotes in your titles - Just don't.

9. No links  - Do not post links that navigate us to Imgur etc, just upload the photo directly onto the subreddit. You will get a better return for your picture by doing this.

10. No selling - This means to not advertise anything that you are trying to sell, such as Only Fans."

**Rule name**|**Description**
:---|:---
**Rule 1: Spoilers**|**Mark submissions with a Spoiler Tag** if it contains spoilers. **Titles of posts cannot contain spoilers**. Posts that do not comply with these will be removed. We consider any Arrow episode aired within the **past two weeks** & a **month for season finales** spoilers, including other Arrowverse shows. Future leaks & content are considered spoilers, as are spoilers for other recent shows & movies.
**Rule 2: No Low Effort Content**|**Threads that are considered low effort are subject to removal at the mods' discretion**. We will remove content completely unrelated to Arrow & posts that are just to gain karma such as ""Literally just a picture of…”. “Shitposts” that do not contain any substantial “Arrow-verse” material fall under this, as do reposts and any sort of spam.
**Rule 3: No Piracy/Illegal Content**|Links to piracy and streaming sites will be removed. **Illegal content in general is not allowed**; bans may be determined based on the severity.
**Rule 4: Be Civil**|**Any harmful, harassing or derogatory comments to or about other people**, including usage of vulgar slurs **will be removed**. Inflammatory/offensive comments and stirring up drama are not allowed. Continued uncivil behavior may result in a ban. Please remember to discern the difference between actors & their characters.  
**Rule 5: Sourcing Correctly**|**Submissions from other people** (fanart, etc) **must be sourced** if possible. Screenshots of unofficial social media accounts must cover up **identifying information** (username, profile pictures).
**Rule 6: No Self Promotion**|This is not a platform to advertise your YouTube Channel or Blog and should not be the primary reason for using this subreddit. **Posts about your own site/channel will be removed**. You may be allowed some posts, but only if you are active, posting non-promotional material & contributing to conversations in other posts. Use your best judgement, if you are overdoing self-promotional posts, you may be banned.

**Content Guide**
******
This is subreddit for **videos** that are similar to content that could be found on the Tim and Eric show.

The Tim and Eric show is an absurdist anti-humour comedy show which is heavily influenced by kitsch and the aesthetics of public access television and relies on awkward presentation to over-stimulate and/or unseat their audience. While Tim and Eric employ these devices intentionally to create a surreal comedic environment, these elements are also active in other content (whether they are applied intentionally or not)—/r/nottimanderic is a home for that content.

If you are still unsure as to what type of content you should be submitting you can check out the first few pages of our top all-time submissions.
----
****
**Rules**
****
1. Content should be relevant - See content guide above.

2. No bullying - Keep your comments on reddit and off youtube. Please message the mods if you suspect a user of bullying.

3. Tag and mark NSFW content - Content containing language (swears and slurs), nudity, sexual content and gore should be tagged and marked. Tags should look as follows: [NSFW – Sexual Content, Partial Nudity]

In the box below the flag grid, you can set custom text for your flair! You can put whatever you like; explain what the flag means to you, tell us where you're from, what you like, whatever! Note: if someone hasn't specified custom text, you won't see anything by their flag. 

We also have spliced versions of the trans and genderqueer flags (thanks, WTFcannuck!), for those with dual citizenship. Choose whatever flag feels right; this isn't an ID card, it's just a fun way to show your colors.

Want these flags on your subreddit? They're open source! Check out the [/r/ainbow flair on github](https://github.com/josecastillo/r-ainbow-flags/).

# A note on moderation #
Comments and/or posts that threaten violence (including threats of self-harm, which will be reported to the admins immediately), incite violence, expose personal information about others without their consent, or contain illegal content **will** be removed.  Please use the ""report"" button on only these types of posts. Contact the moderators if a post/comment has been removed in error.

As of July 2015 we are piloting a new guideline; until we have more precise language, please don't be an asshole. Free expression can only happen when everyone in the community feels empowered to contribute, and behaviors that disempower and silence do more to create an echo chamber than even the heavy-handedest of moderator actions. If you are acting like an asshole to a member of this community, the moderators reserve the right to extend a seven-day temporary ban as a cooling off measure.
***
**TL;DR**:
Report posts that are low effort trolls, homophobic/transphobic, extremely NSFW posts, brigades, discord/chat links, advertisements, spam, and surveys without a moderator comment on them.

gadgets,1,"[](http://goo.gl/vlYYhs)

> **gadget** *(noun)* - a small mechanical / electrical device or tool, especially an ingenious or novel one. [Check out our giveaway calendar!](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/6?cid=Z2FkZ2V0c21vZHNAZ21haWwuY29t)




### Please read the rules:

1. Submissions must be explicitly about a single gadget. (Posts about software or tech companies will be removed. Gadget concepts which do not actually exist belong in /r/ImaginaryGadgets).

2. Self promotion is not allowed in /r/gadgets. Do not submit links to sites that you are affiliated with. Native advertising and ""advertorials"" are also not allowed.

3. Submissions about pre-release or pre-order products are subject to these rules/conditions: 
   - The article must be from a white listed source.
   - The article must be about the gadget, not the company, its business practices, or delivery dates etc.
   - The submitter must not be affiliated with the campaign, company or website

4. No direct image links.

5. Describe the gadget in your post title. No sensationalized, misleading or non-descriptive titles. 

6. Articles must about a single gadget, listicles are not allowed.

7. Keep discussions civil and respectful. Know your [reddiquette!](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). Comments should be on-topic and contribute to the conversation.

8. No Adult Material.

9. English only.

10. If you need advice about a gadget you should ask in the advice [superthread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/about/sticky?num-1). However we highly recommend you also look [at the list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/related_subreddits) since you are more likely to find an answer in a specialized subreddit. 

11. Support original sources. Avoid blogs/websites that rehost content without giving credit. Exact copies are never allowed, as are copies that are just slightly rewritten versions of original articles. 

12. Follow the [reddit site-wide rules](http://reddit.com/rules).

### Moderation Policy

## We use the [reddit FAQ guidelines for spam](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam) when removing spam posts. Additionally, we use a [whitelist system](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/domainlist).

## **If your submission does not appear in the new tab** - it may have been caught by the spam filter. [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgadgets), and we will look at it.

#Subreddit Rules and Wiki
^\(updated ^2022-05-13\)

Before posting in /r/privacy, read the [**Sidebar Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/rules).

Enjoy our [**Wiki**](/r/privacy/wiki/index)! It has all sorts of nifty advice and explains most topics you’re interested in if you’re reading this. 

#THANKS!

On 2018-09-20, we noted:

*I think… I think we’re going to have 100,000 subscribers this week and [that’s all kinds of awesome](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/6yb3ca/i_think_were_going_to_cross_over_to_having_100000/).*

We’ve since grown a bit larger, and we’d like to thank *everyone* who’s subscribed, before and after then. It’s *really* appreciated, and makes us proud of all the work you and we’ve done!

#Ongoing

* [Learn how to spot fake news](https://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/how-to-spot-fake-news/) so you can focus on the facts and protect yourself from fictions.

* Before you use the ""I have nothing to hide"" argument please read [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565) – all of it.  If you can't find the time, then [this article](https://archive.is/P6mcL) should at least get you thinking about why privacy matters.

* [Why surveillance is not OK](/r/privacy/wiki/surveillance_not_ok)

#Info

For artists, writers, gamemasters, musicians, programmers, philosophers and scientists alike! The creation of new worlds and new universes has long been a key element of speculative fiction, from the fantasy works of Tolkien, Le Guin and Howard, to the science-fiction universes of Burroughs, Delany and Asimov, and to the tabletop realm of Gygax, Barker and Greenwood, and beyond.

This subreddit is about sharing your worlds, discovering the creations of others, and discussing the many aspects of creating new universes.

# Rules

Please read our full rules. We have high standards for on-topicness, respect of other people and respect for creative effort.

###RULES  
  
1. **All submissions must be [Artist Name] - [Track Title] (Remixer [if applicable]).** (Doesn't apply to text posts, lineup announcements, interviews, etc). No type beats or trying to sell beats. No mashups. No sob stories or excessive context in the title.

2. **No reposts**. Search for something before submitting it. Throwback posts are allowed but only on the weekend (beginning of Saturday EST to end of Sunday EST). If the song / album has already been posted from a different music service, post your link as a comment in that thread.

3. **Only post links that are directly from the artist's account unless there is no other mirror**. Do not post links from music promotion channels on Youtube or Soundcloud unless the artist specifically chose to premiere the track on the channel.

4. **No excessive self-promo, spam, or asking for feedback.** We don't want creators who only come here to post their own work  or music industry spammers. You may post your own music, but only after your 5th post on the subreddit, and you must follow reddit guidelines on self promotion, less than 50% of your posts should be your own content. First attempts and feedback requests must go in /r/trapproduction and still follow title guidelines.

6. **No memes, photos with artists, or similar low-effort content**. No meetup requests or asking for a track ID in a mix threads, post these in the weekly thread. 

7. Piracy free zone, support the artists. This means **no download links or leaked material**, and no comments asking people to DM you the link. The only exception is if the artist personally comments with a link to the download.  

7. **Don't be a dick.**  
  
8. **No international Spotify or iTunes links posted before midnight EST of the release date.** This is to allow for the entirety of the community to be involved in the conversation. 
  
9. As a community, we have a wide range of genre styles that are considered in our “trap” spectrum, but the mods reserve the right to remove non-relevant songs at their own discretion.

#Who Are We?

**Welcome!** /r/FreeGameFindings is based around finding free games all over the place! Be it Steam, Epic, Origin, Ubisoft Connect, GOG, Xbox, Playstation, or Nintendo Consoles, we will find every last free Game and DLC we can, and get it to you!
#Rules

**Be Respectful**. Toxic behaviour isn't wanted on FGF. The assumption before was that it wouldn't need to be said. While it should be common sense, it's now written out. Just be cool, we're all just hanging out!

1. **No Free To Play Games Or Free Weekends**. We don't allow games that are always free (i.e. TF2 or Dota 2) or basic free weekends on Steam. Only post games that *normally have a price, but are temporarily free to claim and kept forever.* The **forever** part is important.

     On top of that, we also allow free games (that are newer or older offers) that will give '+1' to your steam game count.

     We do *currently* allow Alpha/Beta threads for F2P games. On that note though, the Alpha/Beta has to be acquirable through abnormal means in some way. (So not just ""buying"" on the steam store etc.) 

2. **The Giveaway Has To Be Open To Many.** A safe bet for amount of keys/codes being given away is *1000*. A little lower than that can be cool too, but be reasonable. We do allow raffles here, but they have to be pretty easy to 'fix'. If they're just normal raffles, we currently allow 10k+ key raffles, as they're pretty open. Ala Steamgifts. Something like maybe refreshing/trying again in a minute is safest. Also people should be 99% guaranteed to get access to this item, so no *sign up to possibly get in* type things.

3. **Follow Our Format**. We, or the Automoderator will remove incorrectly posted threads. 

     The format is as follows;

     [Platform] (Game, DLC, Membership, Credit, Alpha/Beta, Alpha, Beta, Software, Demo or Other) *title of free item*. Leave the words 'Free' and 'Giveaway' out of the title, also don't have 'Beta' outside of brackets. No other stuff either. Just the three noted sections above. 

     We accept most platforms and DRMs (GoG, Steam, Epic, Uplay, Console, general PC, and other platforms that exist) that has gaming, however the item in ""()"" must be a Game, DLC, Membership, Credit, or Other.

4. **Do Not Trade, Beg or Post Referral Links**. We don't allow you to trade games here, we don't want you spamming referral-links of any kind. We also ask that you don't blatantly beg for things, most goodies are very simple to acquire.  Even if they're not, just don't do it. We call it begging as a deterrent, but no matter how nicely or politely you're asking, it's still not acceptable. No asking for keys without someone offering first.

5. **Don't Promote Key Farming**. So this is a little issue we've seen here and there. Please refrain from getting more keys for a single game offer. Or at least don't tell people about it. It's not a good thing to do. However I think there's an exception to this. If you're discussing how an offer includes numerous games, and that you're able to try to get those others ones as well, then I don't think it's a problem. Just don't discuss you getting a bunch of one game.

6. **Use Link Flair**. Say there's steps to getting the item, list/walkthrough them in the comments of your thread, then flair it as 'Read Comments'. Does the post require social media? Use that flair. Has it expired? Please flair it as such, this is the most helpful flair to use.

7. **Only Post Offers When They're Live**. If the offer you're posting isn't available yet, or is scheduled for later, you cannot post it. There can be exceptions for times where you need to do something prior to prepare or something like that. In cases like that, post a **[PSA]** and ask mods to approve the post. You can also use the pinned discussion thread to inform as well.

8. **Prior Work Sites**. Alienware giveaways are allowed here, but they can only be acquired without spending real money. AW works on tiers, and you can get tiers by following their rewards system daily. Any tier giveaway is allowed to be posted.

9. **No Mobile Games**. We don't allow mobile games (Android, iOS, or Windows Phone) to be posted here. Please look below for other subreddits you can post those on.

10. **Alpha/Beta Offers Cannot Be Short Timed Test Periods**. This means no test weekends/weeks. If the timed obsolescence is too short, it's not really fitting. As of right now these general limited time Beta offers aren't allowed, at least not without a reward of some kind. Even then it should be noted that the post would be best as being done for the reward alone rather than the beta. *(Other) Game Beta - Tester Reward* 

11. **Mega Threads for Itch.io and ""Exiled"" Offers**. We currently house all Itch.io, and ""exiled"" offerings to ""Mega Threads"" you'll see on the front page of FGF. We're also experimenting with allowing ""high tier"" items to be posted as normal, however this might be iffy and is under Moderator discretion. The ""exiled"" thread is meant for things that are banned from FGF, or have been in a weird position as of late. See to the thread for details.

####Hover or Tap Each Rule for Full Details

##Posting Rules
1. ###All posts must be about philosophy. 
>To learn more about what is and is not considered philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit, see our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/faq). Posts must be about philosophy proper, rather than only tangentially connected to philosophy. Exceptions are made only for posts about philosophers with substantive content, e.g. news about the profession or interviews with philosophers.

2. ###All posts must develop and defend a substantive philosophical thesis.
>Posts must not only have a philosophical subject matter, but must also present this subject matter in a developed manner. At a minimum, this includes: stating the problem being addressed; stating the thesis; stating how the thesis contributes to the problem; outlining some alternative answers to the same problem; saying something about why the stated thesis is preferable to the alternatives; anticipating some objections to the stated thesis and giving responses to them. These are just the minimum requirements. Posts about well-trod issues (e.g. free will) require more development.

3. ###Questions belong in /r/askphilosophy. 
> /r/philosophy is intended for philosophical material and discussion. Please direct all questions to /r/askphilosophy. 

4. ###Post titles cannot be questions and must describe the philosophical content of the posted material.
>Post titles cannot consist only in questions, even if the title of the linked material is a question. This helps keep discussion in the comments on topic and relevant to the linked material. Post titles must describe the philosophical content of the posted material, cannot be unduly provocative or click-baity and cannot be in all caps. 


5. ###Audio/video links require abstracts.
>All links to either audio or video content require abstracts of the posted material, posted as a comment in the thread. Abstracts should make clear what the linked material is about and what its thesis is. Users are also strongly encouraged to post abstracts for other linked material. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/abstracts) for an example of a suitable abstract.

6. ###All posts must be in English. 
>All posts must be in English. Links to Google Translated versions of posts are not allowed. 

7. ###Links behind paywalls or registration walls are not allowed. 
>Posts must not be behind any sort of paywall or registration wall. If the linked material requires signing up to view, even if the account is free, it is not allowed. Google Drive links and link shorteners are not allowed.

8. ###Meta-posts, products, services, surveys, AMAs and links to other areas of reddit require moderator pre-approval. 
>The following (not exhaustive) list of items require moderator pre-approval: meta-posts, posts to products, services or surveys, links to other areas of reddit, AMAs. Please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphilosophy) for pre-approval.

9. ###Users may submit only one post per day. 
>Users must follow all reddit-wide spam guidelines, and in addition must not submit more than one post per day on /r/philosophy.

10. ###Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit /r/suicidewatch.
>If you are feeling suicidal, please get help by visiting /r/suicidewatch or using other resources. See also our discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth).  Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden. 

##Commenting Rules
1. ###Read/Listen/Watch the Posted Content Before You Reply
>Read the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively. If you have unrelated thoughts or don't wish to read the content, please post your own thread or simply refrain from commenting. Comments which are clearly not in direct response to the posted content may be removed.

2. ###Argue your Position
>Opinions are not valuable here, arguments are! Comments that solely express musings, opinions, beliefs, or assertions without argument may be removed.

3. ###Be Respectful
>Comments which blatantly do not contribute to the discussion may be removed, particularly if they consist of personal attacks. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Slurs, racism, and bigotry are absolutely not permitted.

#**New to Lovecraft?**

**Where do I start?**

HP Lovecraft wrote short and unconnected stories. Technically speaking you can read them at random. However for the best experience it's recommended that you read them in chronological order by date written or in most cases, just pick up a book and read left to right.

If you really just want to read the 'greatest hits' then you can browse [the subreddit's top picks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/wiki/recommendations#wiki_stories_by_lovecraft).

**Where can I read Lovecraft?**

With very few exceptions, Lovecraft's entire body of work is in the public domain and can be read online for free from numerous sources. We suggest the [HP Lovecraft Archive](http://hplovecraft.com/writings/fiction/chrono.aspx).

**What book do I buy?**

Please consult the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JLIGbZCVnNSYAFzjg3XteLWn-Vk179kkCzpn6ir9UhY/edit?usp=sharing) for an overview of a large number of physical books. The most popular collections are generally the Knickerbocker edition and Barnes and Noble varieties.

Cooking,5,"#####Please read these

1. All posts must be cooking related.  After all, this is **/r/Cooking**. The name kind of says it all. If the topic is questionable, then it most likely isn't OK to post. 

2. Include plain text recipes for any food that you post, either in the post or in a comment. We love to see your food, but we also want to try it if we wish to.

3. No memes allowed. Not even cooking related memes.  Not all jokes are memes! No trolling, either. 

4. No blog/YouTube channel spamming or advertisements of any kind. If you wish to promote blogs or YouTube channels, please do so only in the weekly ""YouTube/Content Round-Up!"" thread, stickied at the top of the sub. No other advertisement is allowed, even cooking related (e.g., Pampered Chef, Cutco, etc). Reddit is for sharing, not self-promotion.

5. Be kind and conduct productive discussion. As a community, we should look out for each other, not put each other down or bog down discussion.

ArtGW,9,"### IF YOU ARE GOING TO DOWNVOTE, LEAVE A COMMENT. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DISAPPROVAL WITHOUT CRITIQUE HERE.

The premise for creating r/ArtGW is to give users that are putting more effort into their NSFW creations a place to share their work. If you've created art you're proud of, collaborated with someone to create art, or been a muse to someone who has, feel free to share with us!

If you would like to model for a more accomplished/professional photographer, /r/gonewildphotographers is where they share and advertise.

#Posts from deleted users and links to deleted pics will be removed.



**Rule 1: If you didn't create it, don't share it!**

Basically, if you didn't take the photo, draw the picture, record the gif, or paint the painting, don't post it.

Exceptions to this rule are if you're the muse/subject in the image. No other exceptions.

**Rule 2: No Rule34**

Meaning anything that isn't model and artist, don't post it.

No cartoon/comic characters, no TV characters, no actors, etc. We aren't saying those creations aren't art, we're just saying this isn't the sub for them.

**Rule 3: No soliciting upvotes**

Please, for the love of art, let your creations be the inspiration for redditors to upvote!

This means no titles like the following: ""I'm so nervous!"" ""Would you f*ck me?"" ""I think I'm [any negative thing], do you?""

Get creative with your titles! How does your work make you feel?

**Rule 4: No paid site links**

No soliciting your paid sites. We absolutely support your right to sell content, but don't sell it here. This platform is for sharing art, not advertising.

This includes, but is not limited to, Onlyfans (even FREE Onlyfans, because you can still make a profit there) and Patreon. Any link you click and have to pay a subscription to view the content is a no go.

**Rule 5: Be creative!**

If you're going to share a photo of ONLY your genitalia, make sure it isn't just an everyday dick/pussy pick. Be creative! Use lighting, angles, props, or photo editing to make it interesting for everyone.

We've all seen penis. We've all seen vulva. Now make it ART.

**Rule 6: Post limit**

Please limit the number of posts you make to 2 per 24hr period. Anything more than that will be removed.


**HAPPY ARTING!**"
ObscureMedia,1,"[](https://twitter.com/Obscure_Media)
[](https://www.facebook.com/redditObscureMedia) 

####Welcome to r/ObscureMedia :)  
A relaxed place to share and discuss lesser known media: silent films, vintage exploitation flicks, finely aged TV, PSAs and other oddities.

###Posting Guidelines

* **This is a content based sub:**  we want the goods and nothing else will suffice. Links to blogs or review/digest videos/pages are not welcome.

* **No posts consisting of a single image.**

*  **Short clips/edits from content are not allowed:** we want full and complete content.  If you wish to highlight a portion of content in a post please use the YouTube timestamps option while still linking to the full content. [An example can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ObscureMedia/comments/2q50y8/riu_chiu_the_monkees_christmas_show_1967/).

  
*  **Include the release year in the post title:** if not known, an educated guess of the **decade** will suffice.  
 **Acceptable year labels:**  
**(1985)**  **or (1980)s**  
The year must only contain 4 digits inside parentheses () using any other format or not including a (year) will result in deletion.

* **Please search before posting:** nobody enjoys obvious re-posts.

##Promotion/Spam
* **

* **No promotion/spam allowed:**  this isn't the place to promote your music video or short film.

*  **No politics or the like, starting arguments or making political comments will result in an instant ban. This is not the place, move on**

*  **Two postings per user in a 24hr period**

*  **No recently created content:**  in order to discourage promotion, most content created within the past ~5 years will be removed. **This includes upscaled and remastered versions of vintage material**. Blatant Spamming of new content will result in a ban. 
  
* **No ""channel spam'':**  repeatedly linking to a Youtube/etc. channel is not allowed.  Exceptions may be made for users who have uploaded multiple appropriate items to a non-monetized channel.  Contact the mods if this applies to you.  




###Commenting Guidelines

* **Be nice!:** if you post a rudely condescending/attacking/generally dick-ish comment you will be banned with no prior warning.

* **No arguing about what is obscure enough to be posted:**  this should be left to the domain of the upvote/downvote and the moderators.

*    **No memes, image macros, or reaction gifs**.

* **Any comment containing a ""spoiler"" must be formatted:**  
  \[This is a spoiler sentence.](/spoiler)  
  The result is:  
  [This is a spoiler sentence.](/spoiler)  


*  **

* A more complete overview can be found [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ObscureMedia/comments/1gt5ou/some_quick_posting_guidelines_for_robscuremedia/)

*(Images, videos, quotes, news, articles, thoughts, trivia, etc.)*

Note: The Simpsons have made fun of politics pretty much since its inception and there will be political posts from time to time because of that. 

P.S. Join the [/r/TheSimpsons discord for daily trivia.](https://discordapp.com/invite/wN2Dmyv)

# Rules and Guidelines

* **Pay close attention to [the rules & guidelines.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQR-cPXlmY)**
* Please use spoiler tags when necessary:`[X Kills Y](/spoiler)`, ex: [X Kills Y](/spoiler).  
* Hate that it has to be said, but personal attacks, racism, slurs, etc are not allowed and will lead to a ban. Let's just laugh at the Simpsons.
* No NSFW stuff, thanks.
* No meme templates talking about things not relating to the Simpsons. No rewriting quotes to talk about things not relating to the Simpsons. Referencing the real-world is fine (e.g. Simpsons Did It) but no full on re-purposing of quotes to talk about unrelated topics. Use /r/SimpsonsShitposting for that.
* The Simpsons has always had politics within the show. So some political posts are allowed, but if you're completely changing a quote/image just for political reasons it can be removed. 
* We no longer will allow you all to shill the MALK company's products and now remove them. [We get it, MALK is a real thing.](https://reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/search?q=title%3A%22DRINK+PLENTY+OF%22+OR+%22malk%22+OR+%22vitamin+r%22&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) We also won't let you shill the Eddie Stobart trucking company. We get it, [the doors makes a funny.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/comments/hyy4mw/sideshow_bob_the_truck_driver/)

Cryptocurrency discussion *in general* is welcome --
 spamming ICO's/shilling altcoins is not. 

**\#2** Submissions must be thought out and have some depth to them. DD-style posts are preferred.

- DO include external references that explain the rationale behind your statements or include articles that brought you to the sub to ask a question so that people may better understand and help you. 

- DONT leave a stock name and ask ""Thoughts?""

**\#4** No Pump/Dump/stock shilling. Do not mass-post the same submission over and over across the site

**\#5** Please be civil and respect other users. If you disagree with someone's analysis, explain why instead of insulting them for their explanation; [Remember Site Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

**\#6** Please use the original title if you submit an article about stock prices -- if the title is not descriptive enough or is too short, a sub-title may be used in the post as well. If there is none, then a pullquote may be used from the article.

### Please read the rules. All of them. They are for your benefit and everybody else who uses /r/GTAGlitches. If you see a post that is breaking the rules, please use the report feature.

-

##### (hover for more info)
1. Please provide a full and detailed, step-by-step **text** tutorial of any glitch you are submitting. Please also include any video(s) and the glitch's founder(s) (if possible). Do **NOT** submit just a video(s). **Clickbait titles are NOT allowed**. 

2. Do not ask for a payment of any sort. You get one warning, second offense is a ban.

3. Do not post a gamertag anywhere on the subreddit. PM a user if you would like to play online with them.

4. Do not report any users to any Rockstar source, or discuss doing so. This will result in a ban on the first offense.

5. Check to make sure that the glitch or speculative glitch you are posting hasn’t been posted before. If you have an improvement to an already posted glitch, mark your post as [IMPROVED]. When submitting a speculative glitch, you **MUST** include a step by step text tutorial (and any other pertinent information) of what you did to perform said speculative glitch. Simply claiming, ""I did this"" with nothing to validate it is not allowed. The SPECULATION flair is **NOT** for asking questions. Example: Is the arcade dupe glitch patched? 

6. Do not request others to do glitches with/for you or get money for you in-game. Request people to do glitches with you at [Heist Teams](http://www.reddit.com/r/heistteams). If you want a specific car duplicated for you, make a post to [GTA Dupe](http://www.reddit.com/r/GTADupe).

7. Make sure to mark your post with the appropriate flair. Note that question posts are **BANNED**. Use the Daily or Weekly Questions Megathreads for any questions you have. The ""Question"" flair is no longer applicable to posts. Also, do **NOT** make posts regarding Act II/Bogdan Problem glitch. Refer to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaglitches/comments/9wnyor/glitch_doomsday_heist_act_ii_the_bogdan_problem). Act II/Bogdan Problem posts (unless in relation to a patch) will be removed and you will receive a 7 day ban. Further offenses could to lead to a permanent ban.

8. Use the [PATCHED] flair for any glitch post you have shared that isn't over 2 weeks old.

9. Do not post content or link to your own YouTube channel and/or someone else's without giving a proper text tutorial. Doing this is simply self-promotion/promotion and is not allowed.

10. Stay civilized. Rude, harassing, or otherwise unnecessary remarks in the comments (or as a post) will result in a removal of the content. And possibly a ban.

11. The moderators reserve the right to remove any posts and/or comments that they feel are breaking rules or unnecessary. Multiple violations of any of these rules will result in a ban.

12. No Flaming Other User's Posts **(Including GodMode Posts)**
All GTA Glitches are allowed here in r/GTAGlitches and are 100% welcome. Commenting on posts complaining about the post, how it shouldn't be posted here, how they're ""ruining the game"", etc; or flaming OP for posting it will not be tolerated.

###We highly encourage OC posts! Any recent, popular, etc. posts are highly discouraged, as we prefer to see your own OC posts! Also do note that users with newer accounts may not post non-OC, as it can cause a bit of spam!

#Posting guide
1. **Mark NSFW posts.** 

 This includes visible underwear, swimsuits, bunny suits, and suggestive situations.

2. **Minimum resolution and proper aspect ratio.** 

 Wallpapers for any device must be properly sized to fit the screen. 

 Wallpapers for any device must be properly sized to fit the screen. 

 **Minimum resolutions:**
    
     Desktop - **1920x1080**

     Mobile - **900x1600**

 **Allowed aspect ratios:** 

     Desktop - **16:10** or wider

     Mobile - **10:16**, **9:16-9:21**

3. **Source anime and resolution in the title.**

 Include resolution and source anime in the title inside (round) or [square] brackets.


4. **Flair your post accordingly.** 

 Flair your posts according to the type of image you are posting. The available flairs are:

 **Mobile** - Vertical/portrait oriented wallpapers.

 **Desktop** - Horizontal/landscape oriented wallpapers. 

 **Multi-monitor** - Wallpapers designed for more than one monitor.

 **Animated** - Live/Video/Wallpaper Engine wallpapers.

 **Collection** - A themed album of wallpapers.

 **AI-Generated** - Wallpapers containing AI-generated artworks.


5. **Include the original source artwork in the comments.** 

 Properly credit the original artist of all images you post. [SauceNAO](https://saucenao.com/) and [IQDB](http://iqdb.org/) are excellent tools for finding original sources.  

 Respect the artist and their work - do not impersonate, steal from, or infringe on the copyright of other artists.



6. **Requests belong in the weekly request thread.** 

 **All** requests need to be posted in the dedicated weekly sticky thread.


7. **No explicitly lewd content.**

 With respect to reddit's content policy, illustrations with one or more of the following are not accepted: full nudity, undersized clothing for explicit purposes, visible sexual acts or fluids, visible or clearly outlined genitals/nipples, heavy fetishisms.


8. **Quality over quantity!** 

 For wallpapers that share a theme make a album instead of multiple posts. No more than four posts in a 24 hour period. 

 Try to avoid reposting, your post will be removed if it has already been posted in the last 6 months.

--
#Wallpaper quality

- The wallpaper you are submitting should be the highest quality available. You can use indexers like [IQDB](http://iqdb.org/) and [SauceNAO](https://saucenao.com/) to verify this.
- The wallpaper you are submitting should be devoid of any unwanted distortion/stretching, [transparent pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics#Transparency_of_image), [pixelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixelation), and detrimental [compression artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact).
- If an image is not large enough, it can be resized using artificial upscaler programs like [Waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/) or [bigjpg](https://bigjpg.com/).


--
#Wallpaper hosting

- **Reddit**: Images can be uploaded to Reddit's own image hosting with a file size limit of 20 MB ([Legacy](https://i.imgur.com/pjrX5id.png) / [Redesign](https://i.imgur.com/zfWDS6f.png)).
- [**Imgur**](https://imgur.com/): Make a free account first to avoid lossy compression. For anonymous uploads the file size limit is 1 MB, for registered users 5 MB.
- [**ImgBB**](https://imgbb.com/): By making a free account, you can upload images without compression up to a file size limit of 32 MB.

---
**Spoilers in the comments should use the following format:**

    [Anime Title](/s ""spoiler"")

This will show up as [Anime Title](/s ""spoiler"").

**Rules:**

1) MOST IMPORTANT RULE: Please post a description of your Modified Glock/Link post as a top level comment in your post

2) DON'T BE A DICK: This subreddit is about what people consider valuable enough for them to carry on a daily basis. I understand there will be disagreements (religion, politics, firearms/knives... whatever), but stay civil. Downvote comments because they don't contribute to the conversation not because you disagree with someone else.

Mindfulness,7,"Mindfulness is awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally. It is awareness of the present experience with acceptance.     
  
**Rules on /r/Mindfulness**

* **No Blogs/channels/spotify playlists or personal content**

  We have a zero-tolerance policy on spam. We wish you luck in the blogosphere, however, self-promotion is not permitted. If you're unsure what constitutes as spam, please consider reading the reddit ToS located [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-spam-am-i-spammer) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

* **No misleading content**

  Absurd content such as *""mindfulness immediately replaces the need for all anti-depressants.""*

* **No repetitious posts**

 Questions and discussions which have been thoroughly discussed are not permitted. Use the search function if you're unsure. E.g.: *""how can mindfulness help with chronic pain?""*

* **No surveys or forms**

 There are too many requests for survey respondents on /r/mindfulness and they do not actively contribute to the community.

##Subreddit dedicated to the Deus Ex series. Please stay out of the ladies' restroom.

>##Rules - Hover For More Info

#### **Rule 1 - Follow Reddiquette**
> Any post in violation of reddiquette, especially brigading, witch-hunting, vote manipulation, flamebaiting or intentional rudeness will be removed. Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action or hate speech against anyone.

#### **Rule 2 - Right To Anonymity**
> Screen shots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube and other website's comments and discussions should have all identifying names removed. Celebrities, Eidos Interactive and Square Enix employees acting in official capacity are the exception.

#### **Rule 3 - NSFW = NSFW**
> NSFW content must be tagged as such. Likewise do not mark your post as NSFW unless it actually is NSFW. Remember what NSFW means, if its on the line, play it safe.

#### **Rule 4 - Nobody Likes Spoilers**
> If your post contains any plot points, mark it as a spoiler, in accordance with the information below. If you don't or you forget to, the moderators will remove it and you can repost it. The same goes for comments, the exception being comments on a post already tagged as spoilers.

#### **Rule 5 - Content Must Be Relevant**
> All content must be relevant to the Deus Ex franchise or the activities of Eidos Montreal. Unrelated content, reposts, concern trolling, low-effort or especially unoriginal content will be removed at moderator discretion.

#### **Rule 6 - Memes and Low Effort Posts**
> Posts that contain memes, low value, and/or low effort content that don't bring any value to the topic of the subreddit can be removed by the moderators if they deem that the post doesn't meet the quality required. This includes posts that could have been a reply in an already existing thread or post.

>These posts include subjects such as:  
- Questions and offtopic comments that would be better reserved for the FAQ or Monthly Community post  
- Blurry or otherwise unreadable images  
- Cross-posts from other subs that are not directly related to the Deus Ex franchise  
- Images, memes, and photos that are not directly related to the Deus Ex franchise (ex. generic memes, random unrelated photographs and news, low effort edits)

> We will also ask the users to post no more than one Meme/Fluff post per day. If you have made a lot of edits, please consider bundling them in one ""roundup"" post.  
>We encourage you to use /r/dayofsex, our sister subreddit dedicated to Deus Ex memes.

#### **Deleting and Resubmitting Posts**
> In short, doing so is *not allowed*. Deleting and resubmitting a post because it has not gotten enough upvotes is not okay - please only submit your post only once. In case that it looks like the post is not visible at all, please message the mods. Sometimes reddit holds posts back due to low karma, account age, or some other variable only known to reddit. We will look into it if the post needs manual approval.

Breach of these rules may result in a warning or you may be banned permanently, it is up to the moderators and their word is final.

You may see Eidos Interactive and Square Enix employees on this sub. Remember they are people too and are covered by the rules, the same as anyone.

If your post doesn't show up immediately it might have been caught by the spam bot, in which case, message the moderators.

------------------------------------

New here? Got questions? [Check out the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/wiki/faq) first!

------------------------------------ 
## Spoiler Tags
According to rule 4 all posts and comments that contain any plot details must be spoiler tagged with the following code, containing the game/media they spoil.

Type in:

\>!Jensen has cool shades!<
 
and it will show up as:

>!Jensen has cool shades!<

If you can't see them properly, update your browser. Remember spoiler tags don't work in post titles or on links or special formatting.

>[Submit a Text Post.](/r/Shrooms/submit?sidebar&selftext=true)

A place to discuss the growing, hunting, and experience of shrooms. 
Post about your first time or give advice to those who will experience their first time soon. Talk about your favourite teks, kits, species or strains. Post a picture of what you found in your area! Ask for help from other experienced growers on certain problems you're having. Learn about psilocybin and its derivative psilocin. Get help with identifying a certain species of fungus. Learn different ways of taking shrooms. In a tea perhaps? Toppings on a pizza? Maybe using the lemon tek?  



*****

###[Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/about/rules/)

Asking for an ID? Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/5nhmag/required_read_before_posting_an_id_request/) link thoroughly  and follow the dichotomous key and guidelines. We offer no services, it is your own responsibility to confirm any of the *guesses* you see regarding identification. **Consuming toxic mushrooms may result in your death.** Try /r/mycology for non-psychedelic mushroom identification. /r/ShroomID for psychedelic or non-psychedelic mushroom identification. Doing some basic research before hunting for magic mushrooms will vastly increase your ability to find magic mushrooms. We cannot weigh shrooms via reddit, don't bother asking. 

Please keep content directly related to psilocybin mushrooms. Irrelevant content will be removed.

Please keep discussion civil, no trolling. Bigotry and racism may be removed.

It's forbidden to discuss the buying, selling, or sourcing of shrooms/truffles including asking for specific hunting locations or hunting partners. Sourcing of any illicit substances will result in an immediate and permanent ban.

Racism, sexism, ageism, classism, xenophobia, homophobia, or any other discriminatory comments aimed at the content creators, their respective communities, or fellow redditors may result in a ban on first offense without warning at moderators' discretion. Dissent and disagreement through calm and respectful discourse are welcome, but rude and insulting behavior will not be tolerated.

###Click on the ""unlocked"" tab for only unlocked posts!

Welcome to /r/WhatsInThisThing! 

This subreddit was *ORIGINALLY* created to track the progress of breaking into [**this vault**](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1aenk5/a_friend_of_mine_moved_into_a_former_drug_house/) on r/pics, and it got off to a MASSIVE start! 

------

**ABOUT:**

This subreddit is a place for anyone who has acquired a safe, piggy bank, briefcase, treasure chest, oak barrel, thumb drive, bottle, locker, storage unit, abandoned home, bomb shelter, antique can, maybe even a confidential file to post pictures of the adventure of finding out what's inside it. If you come across a safe or mystery box, it can be dangerous to open it. Make sure you know what you're doing. 

-------

**SUBREDDIT JARGON:**

**Mystery Box** - Any item that is a safe, piggy bank, briefcase, treasure chest, oak barrel, thumb drive, bottle, locker, storage unit, abandoned home, bomb shelter, antique can, a confidential file, or anything of that sort

**Locked** - Anything that has not been unlocked yet; anything we don't know the contents of. 

**Unlocked** - A solved mystery; OP delivers and we find out what was inside!

-------

**RULES:**

- You must post a picture of your mystery box.

- No reaction gifs, memes, image macros, joke posts, or anything else like that. If you find any of these, please hit the report button and a mod will get around to removing it. You can post those in /r/ShittyWITT.

- Do not abuse your ability to post, abusive posters will be banned. 

- You must use the following **flairs** when making your post: 

- If your mystery box is locked then set the flair to **""Locked""**

- Once you open your mystery box, set the flair to **""Unlocked""**

- If you are updating a previous post set your flair to **""Update""**

- If you have some helpful information to post, set your flair to **""Helpful Information""**

- Don't attack or insult any of the OPs, it goes against the site wide [reddiquete](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). **Moderators reserve the right to remove any comments that are insulting or attacking the OP of any post.**

Few Things to Remember:

- OC (Original content), self posts, and any other active Redditors are ***forbidden***.  Because there are already over 100 subs dedicated to OC, we have elected to keep /r/NSFW_GIF free of it. DO NOT post yourself in this subreddit. You will be banned. 

- Excessive x-posting is ***forbidden***.  Do not repost something already posted elsewhere many times, whether by you or anyone else.  A couple of x-posts are fine.

- Don't repost anything from our top 100 of all time.

- Anything safe for the public, e.g. swimwear, is considered SFW and will be removed.  No censored content. No animations or cartoons. 

- No spam, soliciting, or tagging/watermarking.  No selling or sellers of anything, anywhere.  

- Want to find where an image comes from or who a model is? Search for yourself! Do not ask here.  Try /r/NeedSource, /r/TipOfMyPenis, or /r/PornID. Posts or comments asking for source/name will be removed and users will be banned.  

- Discord links are forbidden.  ***Any discord links***, whether posts or comments, will be removed and the user permanently banned.


- There is zero tolerance for trolls, assholes, unsolicited bots, deliberately off-topic content, or novelty accounts. If you are any of these, and act as such, or encourage any of the above or any other violations, you will be banned.

- No compilations. Gifs of single scenes only.

- Please keep disparaging remarks about your body (including before photos) or others' bodies to a minimum. 
- Remember weight loss is not always the motivation for fitness, and is not always the right answer.
- Add user flair!"

####[/r/CasualConversation has great resources for just about any problems you may be having](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/support)

This is a subreddit for memes that hit too close to home or are too real for subs like /r/meirl

We are not /r/depression however, the sticky is a good resource for if you need real help. If you have depression, talk to a therapist, it really does help. You are not alone, and recovery is possible and worth it.

If you find jokes about suicide, depression or self harm upsetting, this sub might not be the right place for you. This is a place for people who use self deprecating humor as a coping mechanism, not for those making fun of mental illness.

With that out of the way, the rules are as follows:

* **Asking for upvotes/downvotes will get you banned**. And any other vote related bullshit for that matter.

* Posts *MUST* be in some way ""too real"" or hit to close to home. If it doesn't make you laugh and feel sad at the same time, don't post it here. Posts that do not fit the sub may be removed.

* Being edgy doesn't make a post good. Post content that you find a bit too relatable, not something making fun of people with depression.

* Posts should be titled 2meirl4meirl or some variation, but other titles are fine for ~~shitposts~~ self posts.

* Be supportive. Most people here are going through something, and sometimes all it takes to improve a shitty day is just a little kindness from an Internet stranger.

* Racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, any other form of discrimination and general dickishness *will not be tolerated.*

* Mark NSFW content as such. And please don't post NSFL content, we are not /r/watchpeopledie

* **Reposts are allowed**, but discouraged

* Don't link to an image if it won't be there permanently. Basically, just don't link to files hosted on 4chan.

* Again, please don't be an asshole.

* If any of you fucbois post mr skeltal you will not have good bones and calcium, and instead your post will be removed. Mr skeltal will not be thanked. Dat boi as well.

###Rules

1. Be descriptive. Tell us what device you have, what carrier you're on, what you've tried, etc. If you think it's relevant to your problem, TELL US!

2. Be patient. You're getting free help from Internet strangers. You might have to wait a few hours for an answer. Also, don't spam - there are very few times when you should really have to ask a question a second time without any significant change between the two times.

3. Be helpful. If someone asks you for more information, tell us what you can. If someone asks you for a screenshot, please provide one!

4. Be nice. Treat others with respect, even if you don't agree with their advice. Accordingly, you should expect others to be nice to you as well. Report anyone who gives an intentionally rude answer.

5. No questions or answers that involve trying to break the law or bypass security measures or DRM. This includes bypassing PINs, biometrics, passwords, lockscreens, FRP, piracy, and screenshots/screen recordings of copyrighted material

6. User flair is to be used to denote your device brand and model. Only Moderators may have (MOD) in their user flair. 

7. Post flairs should follow these guidelines. Post flairs are not required, but may help in the support process. If it is determined that a flair isn't being used correctly, the OP will be messaged asking to change it to a more appropriate flair. 

8. No affiliate / marketing links.

9. [We also have a Discord server!](https://discord.gg/bWYTh46) (And yes, the same rules apply there.) 

###Flair Usage

* **Solved** | Mark your question as solved

* **Rooting Help** | help with rooting, phone bricking, anything to do with rooting.

* **Device Settings** | Question pertaining to device system settings. This is not to be used for specific app settings.

* **App-specific** | Anything to do with a specific app, including but not limited to, problems and settings.

* **Custom ROMs** | Questions about ROMs, where to get them, ROMs for your phone.

* **Looking for suggestions** | Suggestions, whether it be for a new phone, new tablet, app, accessories, etc.

##ASSTASTIC RULES
1. You must be verified to post.

1. Include [M]/[F]/[T] gender tags in your titles. Feel free to be creative when doing so!

1. You are allowed one post in a 24-hour period. Failure to abide by this rule will result in a warning. Continuing to ignore this rule will result in a 10 day ban. Followed by a permanent ban if this behavior is persistent.

1. Report any comments or threads you find rude or abusive. Mods will check the reported queue as often as humanly possible. Should you come across users being mean-spirited, or people posting personal info (names, phone numbers, etc.), please report it and help keep this a drama-free zone.

1. Don't make blatantly 'creepy' or 'threatening' comments. Don't be mean. This goes for posters as well, don't feed trolls! Report them instead.

1. The Reddit spam filter sometimes mistakenly nabs genuine non-spam posts. If you think a submission of yours or someone else has been ""autobanned"" then please contact the moderators.

1. No posting of pictures with URLs to external websites. Advertising of this kind or other kinds will lead to your post being removed and may lead to a ban. 

1. Commenters who ask for invitations, requests, followers, subscriptions etc. to outside social media accounts will be banned Examples: Kik/Skype/Snapchat/Facebook/Onlyfans/Manyvids. Similarly, as posters, please don't mention your other social media handles here, and do not direct users to DM you or look at your profiles if you are selling.

1. If you use Reddit to sell panties, cam shows, or anything similar, please do not advertise this in your posts. We warmly welcome sellers to share their content, but selling and advertising are not allowed here!

## Rule #9: Mods will use their discretion

* The /r/BDSM subreddit family mods will take things on a case by case basis and remove posts/comments and ban users at their discretion. We reserve the right to use our own judgment and ban anyone from the subreddit or entire subreddit family if we view you as being detrimental to the community, regardless of if you break any specifically stated rule.
* When the mods say to do something, stop something, or let something go, do it. If you have a concern you are free to send us a politely worded modmail, but arguing or being rude to the mods is a one way ticket to a permaban.

#Guidelines#

1.  **This is a place of support.**  All the following ways of responding to at-risk OPs are strictly forbidden. If you see anything like this in a post or comment, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch).      
     * **Abuse or ""tough love""** ***including any guilt-tripping like ""suicide is selfish"" or ""think of your loved ones""***.      
     * **Pro-Suicide Posts or Comments,** ***or any explicit discussion of suicide methods***       
     * **Religious proselytizing**  
     * **Trolling or incitement to suicide or any type of self-harm or violence**    
     * **Anything that's not a direct, personal, supportive response to the OP.**

1.  **Please note that we are NOT a hotline!** We do NOT have the ability to trace the source of any posts, and we can't guarantee immediate responses. 

1.  **We offer non-judgemental peer support ONLY.**  The only requirement to respond here is genuine concern, so please don't take anything you read here as professional advice. It's fine to share what worked for you, but **DO NOT advocate for or against any specific type of therapy, self-help strategy, or medication, especially street drugs or alcohol, and DO NOT diagnose people** 

1.  **If you're here to help please respond** ***publicly*** **to our OPs in need.**  Sort by ""new"" and check for posts with few or no good responses.  The rules below link to posts with details.     
     * [Posts shouldn't include or request contact information.](http://redd.it/dmu24)  
     * [Don't ""advertise"" yourself as a helper, authority, or role model.  This includes inviting private contact as a first resort.](http://redd.it/xgrba)
     * [Do NOT post general ""uplifting"" or anti-suicide messages. Encouragement should never be offered until you've demonstrated understanding of the OP's emotions and experience, to ***their*** satisfaction, not yours! This also means no fundraising or activism, please.](http://redd.it/1cep2h) 
     * [Please, **never make promises to our vulnerable OPs that you personally can't keep**.  This means ***not*** saying ""it gets better"" or guaranteeing any outcomes!  It also means not to make any ""supportive"" but unverifiable assertions about the OP, i.e. telling them they're a good/strong/etc. person.](http://redd.it/25igd7)

1.  **We err on the side of safety**. If we need to remove a post or comment from someone who's reached out for help, we'll let them know why we removed it and how they can change it.  If this happens to you, please know that we **do** want to talk to you.  

1.  **If you need help but don't feel comfortable making a post** for any reason, please [**message the moderators**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch).  We will be glad to talk with you privately, or help in any other way that we can.

1.  Surveys and research participation requests ***must*** be pre-approved by the mod team. Posts we have okayed will be flaired.

buildapcforme,3,"#####[Submit a Build Request](https://tinyurl.com/bapc4merequest)
[Click here to access the pre-filled build request template via old.reddit.com](https://tinyurl.com/bapc4merequest). Mobile app or reddit redesign users may copy and paste the template from [**here**](https://pastebin.com/raw/JGdEuzNQ).

---

#Rules and Guidance
**Tip: Hover over each rule for an explanation.**
#### Build Requesters:

Rule| Explanation
---|---
All build requests must fill out the submission template. | This can be found by clicking the ""Submit a build request"" button, or at the bottom of the regular self-post submission page. If you're not posting a build request, use a tag at the start of your post's title. Tags include [Meta], [Discussion], [Question], [Update]. Mobile app users may copy and paste the template from [**this page**](https://pastebin.com/raw/JGdEuzNQ).
If you need a build in a less commonly requested country, include some places you can order from. | Most building sites, like PCPartPicker and PC Hound, have retailer from *most* countries catalogued. They don't have all retailers in all countries though, so it's worthwhile to include some places you can order from if your country is not catalogued.
Absolutely no troll requests. | That means no ""I have no budget give me the best!"" requests. It also means if you're not planning on legitimately building it, don't post it. Remember, users *volunteer* their time and expertise here.
If your post goes 24 hours without receiving an adequate response, you may post your request again. | This can be if you didn't get any replies at all, or if you don't think you got the help you needed. Several posts in a shorter time scale is considered spam and may be removed.
Be prepared to answer additional questions from contributors. | To get the best PC possible, contributors might ask extra questions. If you have any extra information you might be asked about, just include it in the ""Extra info or particulars"" part of the template before you post.

#### Build Contributors:
Rule | Explanation
----|-----------
All builds must have some form of parts list, pricing, and an explanation or brief description of your suggestions. | This lets OP know why you've suggested what you have, and it lets others see your thought process & learn from it.
When coming into a thread where others have already posted builds, look over existing suggestions before posting your own. | This means you see any additional information that may have been provided by the OP, and also gives you a chance to give suggestions to other builders.
Carefully read through provided criteria. | If you need more information, just ask the requester. It's better to ask than make an assumption.
Aim to keep below budget. | If you feel it's necessary to go over budget, make sure to justify it. It's also worth suggesting how your build can be pared back to be within the original budget if needed.
Check stock on items you include in a build. | This goes especially for sale items. You'll find sale items can be out of stock, meaning you'll have to find an alternative.
No advertising or payment for personal gain. |This includes all sale of hardware, software or labour, ""PM me for x"" posts and ""donations"" in return for advice or other goods. This is not a place for personal gain.
Absolutely no troll suggestions. | If you aren't willing to make a serious suggestion, don't make one. Stupid or sarcastic suggestions only confuse those needing help.  
Try to keep advice in the thread, rather than in private messages | Unless it's obvious that it's more appropriate, keep all discussion in the thread. It allows users (both those involved and not involved) to come back and reference it later, and use it as a learning tool.

#### General:
Rule | Explanation
----|-----------
Keep discussion polite, civil, and on-topic. | Disruption, rudeness and derailing are all grounds for your post to be removed. Report posters you believe are violating this by using the report function or messaging the moderators [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbuildapcforme).
Message the moderators if you have any questions, issues or queries. | We're [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbuildapcforme) to help!
Message the moderators if you see someone consistently posting builds with severe issues. | Send a message [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbuildapcforme).
Don't blindly downvote 'bad builds'. Reply with some ways the suggestions could be improved. | The only way to improve is if somebody tells you how and why your suggestions aren't great. Remember to reserve your downvotes for posts that are *grossly* misleading or flawed, or add no meaningful discussion to the thread.
Discussion of piracy and TOS-violating OS keys is forbidden. | This includes all promotion, discussion, suggestion, implication, insinuation etc. of piracy, so-called ""grey-market"" OS licence keys, and resold licenses. Such licenses may come from key-selling websites or other sites, including reddit. If it's unusually cheaper than retail, it's probably forbidden. If you're not sure, send a message to the moderators and ask. Posts breaking this rule will be removed and not reinstated.
Circumvention of rules is strictly prohibited. | Such circumvention may result in a ban. This includes, but is not limited to, obfusticating information or offering private messages.
Posts may be removed at the moderators' discretion. | Nothing is ever black-or-white, so if a post is clearly detrimental to the community, it will be removed.

glitch_art,10,"*Dedicated to the art of Databending*


Post links to glitch art and anything related; your creations, others creations, tutorials, tools, whatever. Though you can post others work, it's strongly encouraged that you post your own creations. 

-



###Core Rules:
Mods will enforce these in all cases

| Rules  | Notes   |
|:-----------|------------|
|   1. Explain    | Glitch is very much a DIY artistic movement, as such sharing techniques and methods is essential to keeping it alive and interesting. If someone asks how you made a glitch, give a good detailed answer. If you’re keeping your secrets safe, then post elsewhere.|
|2. Don’t be an ass |   Personal insults will not be tolerated. If you have criticism keep it constructive and follow [reddiquette.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)
| 3. No overtly sexual images |   Like, a nipple is okay, but for more than that go to /r/NSFWGlitchArt or/r/glitch_porn 
|4 . No ads, no sales of any kind, no linking to your store in the comments | We are not a marketplace. If someone asks for if they can buy a print or something DM them, do not post a link to buy in the comments. 
5. Credit the original artist |  If you post someone else’s work, you must credit them, or if you don’t know who made the work, state that it is not yours and hopefully someone will chime in.|


###Secondary Rules:
We’ll be a little more lax on these. . .

| Rules  | Notes   |
|:------------------|------------|
|   1. Cool it on the Deep Dream and Pixel Sorting images    | /r/Glitch_Art is officially designated as the Demilitarized zone between these two feuding states. If you’ve implemented a pixel sort as part of something else, or it is particularly unique, please post it here. Same for Deep Dream stuff. But if you aren’t doing something particularly new, please post it in either /r/deepdream or /r/pixelsorting|
|2. Post the original |   We like seeing the comparison, so post the original in the comments or with the glitch in an album.
| 3. No more than 3 posts at once |   Don't spam the frontpage. Any more than 3 should just be put into an album and submitted as one post. 
4. No Broken screen glitches |  Sometimes things glitch but aren't art.|
5. The mods reserve the right to remove low effort posts |  Of course this is subjective and rarely happens, but if your post is removed and you feel it shouldn't have been, message us!|

welcometohell,3,"###Welcome to Hell! 

This is the home of all things terrifying. Once you enter *you can never leave*. Here you'll find all things dark, creepy, scary and terrifying (paranormal stuff, ghosts, urban legends, creepy videos, hauntings etc..).  

**This is a HORROR community. Most of the things posted here probably aren’t SFW, bear that in mind.**

***
###Rules:

**1. Treat others with respect**

Don't be rude, abusive or derogatory. Comment positively and respectfully.

**2. Posts should be dark, creepy, scary, terrifying, etc..**

If it's not any of these, it probably doesn't belong here. If you don't find something fitting with the sub, report it so it's flagged to the moderators who will take care of it.

**3. No gore/NSFL please**

These posts take things to an entirely different level and as such belong elsewhere.

***

###You may also be interested in:

r/AbandonedAsylums - a subreddit dedicated to images, videos and general discussion of Abandoned Asylums and Psychiatric Hospitals throughout the world.

r/truecreepy - a place for creepy things, anything that you can think of that is genuinely creepy. This is no place for anything but creepy things.

***"
lewronggeneration,3,"This is a subreddit dedicated to satirically mocking those people who, blinded by their own nostalgia, believe certain things in the past to be unequivocally better than today. We place a special emphasis on music, because this subreddit was created after annoyance over ""born in the wrong generation"" attitude often expressed by fans of 60s/70s rock.

##RULES
### 1. Posts must fit the spirit of the subreddit.
Posts should be images or videos of quasi-nostalgic attitudes, often with a sense of superiority. This can apply to music, other media, or societal trends at large.

### 2. No identifying information.
Any identifying information must be cropped out or hidden. This includes usernames, group names, and photos of people. Cross-posting is only allowed if the content itself is appropriate for the subreddit. If you want to link to a reddit post or comment, take a screenshot instead and scrub identifying information.

### 3. Original content and satire
Don't post content you created yourself. Satire is allowed but must be submitted with the ""Satire"" flair.

### 4. No bigotry.
Racism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, ableism, etc. will not be tolerated.

### 5. No shitty behavior.
Maintain civility and keep the elitism at the door. Disagreements are fine, namecalling is not. Basically, don't be a dick. This is up to moderator discretion.

### 6. Excessive shitposting
Low-effort posts like meme spam, lyric trains, etc. are not allowed.

**subReddit for pics of women kissing**

Picture or GIFV only, please.

**18+** years of age only. **Kissing only.**

That means: **No Sex**, only kissing.

* Link directly to an image if JPG

* Link to normal GIFV page if GIFV

* Don't ask questions in the title

**No Advertising**, please! Mod are asking that you not post advertising, even if you are posting your OC. Please watermark your content so that users know how to find you.

Don't ask for 'source' or 'names' or others questions in the title of a post. This sub is for sharing, not for requesting.

Use direct links to images and GIFV links because they work better with mobile Apps and [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) and the in-line viewer.

The sub is for women kissing. **Don't post sex**, keep it about the kissing.

That means: _No genital play. _No body fluids. _No penises.

Don't post porn, unless edited down to *kissing*, *only*.

**Please report any inappropriate links.**

Please report and downvote links that include sexual contact. Posts shouldn't even *imply* genital play, if there's more than kissing then it belongs somewhere else.

#**Guidelines**
^^Posts ^^that ^^do ^^not ^^follow ^^these ^^guidelines ^^may ^^be ^^subject ^^to ^^removal ^^at ^^mod/community ^^discretion.

Every post is required to be a picture of a path, discussion on the paths, or otherwise related to paths. (A path here shall be an area used to get between two or more points, the path must be used by a living thing).

* Worn tracks don't necessarily constitute a desire path.
* Avoid posts of animals in zoos.
* Try to ensure your path is an apparent disregard for designated paths.

_______

**From Wikipedia**

A desire path (also known as a desire line, social trail, goat track or bootleg trail) can be a path created as a consequence of foot or bicycle traffic. The path usually represents the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination. The width of the path and its erosion are indicators of the amount of use the path receives. Desire paths emerge as shortcuts where constructed ways take a circuitous route, or have gaps, or are lacking entirely.

**Nature Conservation and Desire Paths:**

Are you a hiking fan? Do you enjoy your national parks for their natural beauty?

Please consider the following: the use of these paths in nature conservation areas should be discouraged due to the harm to the vegetation. Additionally, people should stick to the predetermined trails for their safety—just because a path is there doesn’t mean it’s safe.

Desire paths in developed urban areas generally don't cause disruption to the ecosystem the same way they would in conservation sites.

^^PSA ^^by ^^u/ibettershutup

You are encouraged to find desire paths of your community and post pictures of them here.

**Conduct Guidelines**

1. Discussion of piracy methods will not be permitted. Expect posts facilitating or promoting piracy to be removed. This includes discussion of 'unlocker' or other methods used to violate the Mac OS EULA by running Mac OS on non-Apple hardware. Support requests involving Mac OS on unsupported hardware (not a Mac) or software (VMware Workstation or VMware Player) will be removed, and will result in a ban. We have zero tolerance on this rule.

2. Keep post submissions relevant to VMware. Off-topic posts may be locked or removed.

3. Spammers will be banned; this sub will not become a marketing cesspit for vendors. Don't submit links to blogspam or other low-quality content. Repeatedly submitting links to the same blog/YouTube channel/etc. within a short period of time will be considered spam. Brazen marketing material is also generally unwelcome.

4. Want to promote something within the community? Message the mods first with your proposal, and we'll decide if it's too spammy or not.

5. Don't be a jerk. Vulgarity and hostility towards other users will not be tolerated. 

6. Don't post brain dumps for certification exams.

**Guidelines for Technical Help**

Posts that fail to meet these guidelines may be locked or removed:

1. This is a *VMware*-oriented community. While discussion of virtualization concepts in general is appropriate, _requesting technical help for non-VMware products is off-topic_.

2. When asking for technical support, please specify the specific VMware product(s) and version(s) you are working with. 

3. When asking for assistance or advice, please give the community sufficient information to work with. Specify your problems/needs, technical requirements, and objectives clearly.

**Icons:**

The VMware logo icon following a username indicates that this user is a VMware employee.

If you are an employee, please PM one of the moderators that has a VMware logo for verification instructions and we will add it to yours as well!

**Certification Flair:**

To get flair with your certification level send a picture of your certificate with your Reddit username in the picture to the moderators.

**Spam Filter:**

The spam filter can get a bit ahead of itself. If you make a post and then can't find it, it might have been snatched away. Please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23vmware) and we'll pull it back in."

sadcringe,1,"##Welcome to /r/sadcringe! 
### /r/sadcringe is a place for awkward or embarrassing situations that also make you feel sad.  
  
(Please note: the 'sad' part of /r/sadcringe is in reference to when something makes you feel sad, it's not about calling someone out for *being* sad.)

[Example post. This image is good because it is sad, but also makes you cringe.] (https://i.imgur.com/uGnRtvo.jpg)

##Rules:

1. **Posts must be sad and cringe.** The content of the post must be both cringy and sad. Unhappy, depressing sad – not pathetic loser sad. We're not here to make fun of people. The content should make you go: ""oof, that hurts"", not: ""lol, what a moron"". 

1. **No personal info.** This includes all usernames, names, and any other identifiable information. This also means no direct linking to other subreddits in your submissions.

1. **No minors.** Do not post content that includes anyone under the age of 18. This will result in a ban.

1. **No bullying.** We will not tolerate any type of bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or incitement of violence. Violations will result in a temporary or permanent ban. Be nice.

1.  **No brigading.** Do not brigade or encourage brigading of this or other subreddits/websites.  

1. **Follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)** at all times. Failing to do so will result in a ban.

1. **No memes or obvious jokes.** We only accept real life situations. There are plenty of other subs for memes and jokes.

5) No fake/staged/forced perspective images or videos if they have no sweaty palms inducing qualities. Some of them work, most of them don't. If I can tell it's fake, I'll probably remove it.

6) No reposts

7) Use descriptive titles"

We want to keep our subreddit legit for the cast and crew that have worked on the show in past and future. Any post or comment linking to a live stream or illegal download site for Downton Abbey might get removed. We will not censor our IRC channel, because it is a great medium for free speech and we support that. We take this seriously, violating this policy *can* result in a ban.

IWantOut,6,"#*Welcome to r/IWantOut, Reddit's expat subreddit. Please read the sidebar for general advice and helpful links.*

If you want out of wherever you live, we're here to help.

Got questions? Want advice and experience from people who have gotten out or are still trying? Have a good tip or a success story to tell? Just need support? No matter where you're from or where you're going, you're welcome here.

###☞This is a space to discuss strategies and advice for legal immigration, NOT to debate about refugees, undocumented migrants, the ethics/wisdom of various immigration policies, etc. Posts and comments that stray from the subject of legal immigration will be removed and you may be warned or banned depending on the severity of the offense. Report rule violations. If you have any questions, feel free to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FIWantOut) with violations.

_____________

**★ RULES ★**

1. Be respectful and stay on the topic of legal emigration/immigration. **This is not a political subreddit**. Politics might be the reason you want out, which is perfectly fine. Instead of writing 3 paragraphs about what specifically you don't like, write ""I disagree with the politics"" and then talk about what you're looking for. It'll help prevent purely political comments.

2. No requesting or giving advice on how to conduct illegal activities, including marriage to strangers. We want you to be safe, and, furthermore, such posts violate reddit's sitewide policies.

3. When requesting/giving advice, please be **as detailed as possible** when describing your situation: country of origin/destination, age range, education, qualifications, budget, etc.
We do allow ""-> anywhere"" posts. Please do your own research to find a short list of countries you'd like to go to. You need to include extra information based on what criteria you have (weather, jobs, etc.). Lack of narrowing criteria will result in post removal.

4. Observe the title format. All posts must follow our prescribed title format, violations of this will be removed. [Please look at the wiki for specific formatting information](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/wiki/titleformat). Do not use a different post type tag to bypass formatting requirements. The format is simple enough to follow, and [you can test it at the following link before posting](https://regexr.com/4t6t0). **The mods will not approve posts which do not pass the title format restrictions**.  

5. Recommendations are OK; spam/advertising is not. If you're not sure if your post follows this, ask. In general, posting links to things is welcome as comments on relevant posts, but we rarely allow them as posts. In order to prevent our community from being inundated with survey requests, **we universally do NOT allow surveys**. If you ask the mods to post your survey, you will be politely declined. If you post anyway, you will be permanently banned.

6. Please report rule violations. If you notice a violation of Rules 1, 2, 3, or 5, please **REPORT** it. Please do not send links of these posts/comments to modmail. **The one exception to this is Rule 4: Observe the title format, please send Rule 4 violations to modmail**. We don't accept reports on the title format, because we've found that the majority of those reports are incorrect as people don't understand the title format. Instead, we ask that you send links to modmail, so that if you're incorrect, we can at least explain why you're incorrect so that hopefully in the future, you'll know what to look out for.


**★ PROTIPS ★**

* Permanently residing in a country in which you currently don't have citizenship **almost always requires a visa (legal permission to live there).** Visa rules differ depending on the country/region, but they generally require that you demonstrate a good reason for moving there: family, in-demand skills, pursuit of higher education, etc. It can be a daunting process, but if you're serious about getting out you should thoroughly research the visa you'll need to obtain to do so. Some of the links below might help.

* Are you upset about the political situation in your country? Fair enough. But do your homework and don't make any rash decisions – immigration takes time and effort, and the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Remember, too, that /r/IWantOut is for requesting and sharing tips for legal immigration, not having political debates. It's OK to say, ""I'm looking for a country with X policies on issue Y,"" but be sure to stay civil and stay on topic.

* Before posting, try searching the subreddit (at the top of this sidebar). It's possible your question has been asked before.

* Can't find the answer you're looking for here? Check to see if there's a subreddit for the country and/or city you want to go to.

perfectloops,2,"##[ ](#icon-lightbulb)Rules

|||
|:-|:-|
|1. Animated .gifs only|Animated .gifs are the only kind of submission allowed (besides self posts). Websites, flash animations, videos, music, or any other submission that is not an animated .gif will be removed. Gfycats or similar HTML5 videos are also allowed if they restart automatically and do not include sound.|
|2. Must loop seamlessly|The .gif must have no visible beginning and end. Something must always smoothly be carried over from one frame to the next to make the gif seamless. Some elements that can be considered a seam include but are not limit to: noticeable cuts, objects/parts that noticeably jump, a point that is just static background or one solid color, screen wipe or other transitions between unrelated shots, etc.|
|3. No ping-ponging .gifs|Ping-ponging refers to when a gif plays forward, and then plays in reverse. These gifs appear to ""go forever"", however they are not perfect loops. A loop, by definition, never displays the same frame until the action is completed. This rule is our most strictly enforced, and in fact if a .gif even so much as appears to be a ping-pong, it will be removed. The one time ping-ponging is allowed is if part of a .gif pingpongs, while part of it loops [(example)](http://www.reddit.com/r/perfectloops/comments/179rp0/now_this_is_a_perfect_loop_xpost_from_rgifs/).|
|4. Titles must include [A] or [L] and, if applicable, NSFW or SPOILER|All submissions must contain [L] or [A] in the title to denote Live-Action or Animated loops. NSFW .gifs are allowed, but must have the term [NSFW in the title](http://www.reddit.com/r/perfectloops/comments/203ows/mod_nsfw_gifs_can_stay_but_must_have_nsfw_in_the/). NSFL (""not suitable for life"" such as gore, death, disease, etc.) posts are not allowed and violators will be banned on the first offense. Titles with possible spoilers must include SPOILER in the title.|
|5. No reposts|If a .gif has been posted to this subreddit, it can not be posted here again until the original can no longer be voted on (after 6 months). You can check if your image has been posted here already by using [Karma Decay](http://karmadecay.com/r/perfectloops), or by searching this subreddit. Searching the subreddit may not be as effective, since people do not always provide descriptive titles. Also, posts from the top 50 posts of all time are not allowed to be reposted.|
|6. Use a reliable, directly-linkable host|Use a host that can handle potential traffic, does not have intrusive ads, and preferably works with RES. These hosts include but are not limited to: imgur, gfycat, others on the whitelist, etc.|
|7. No ""broken"" .gifs|Broken gifs are ones which have purposefully been ""glitched"" or use artificial .jpeg artifacts to make a .gif appear like a glitched video. Please take these to /r/brokenGifs.|
|8. No ""cloned"" .gifs|Cloning is a technique in which the subject of the .gif is duplicated. This technique can be applied to any .gif in which the subject enters and exits the frame, and therefore is not allowed. Gifs in which the subject simply enters and exits the frame are also not allowed. However, if there is interaction between cloned subjects, then that is an exception that can stay. Please take these gifs to /r/ClonedGif.|
|9. Requests must be text/self posts|We want our subreddit to be a content provider. For this reason, requests must be posted as [text or self post](http://www.reddit.com/r/perfectloops/submit?selftext=true). Use a standard link post otherwise. Fulfilled requests can be posted in the comments section of the request, or as their own link. The user who fulfills a request can then post the image and claim it as OC. If the person requesting the gif wants to post it, they can, so long as they ask permission from the person who made it for them. They will not be allowed to use the OC tag, however.

syriancivilwar,8,"# About us





This subreddit is dedicated to the current conflicts ongoing in Syria and Iraq, along with their regional and global ramifications.

Due to the sensitivity of the topic, every and especially new users are strongly encouraged to read the rules and inform themselves of the conflict more generally before posting. The moderators enforce the relatively strict rules and it is strongly encouraged to put thought into one's activity on this subreddit. It is expected that user put back their individual bias as much as possible and respect other users no matter what background they're from.

We especially encourage critical and substantive on-topic discussion, as long as it is done in a civil and respectful manner to any other user of the community. This forum is especially useful for bringing in new perspectives to new users and provide new specific and circumstancial information. 

If there are questions, please contact the moderators via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsyriancivilwar) or ask in the Dumb Question tuesday threads. Other information can be found in our wiki. 

###SyrianCivilWar Rules

- The rules are relatively strict and should be followed as close as possible. Warnings are enforced by the moderators and depend on the context and a user's history; a similar offense may thus be met with very different responses based on the user that made it. Punishments will generally follow this scheme: 1. Warning -> 2. Warning -> 3. Warning and 3 day ban -> 4. Warning -> 5. Warning -> 6. 7 day ban and last warning -> 7. Permaban or longer ban. Mods will try to always give valid reason and reference to the rule that is being broken, but please keep in mind they are humans and make mistakes too. 

- It will frequently happen that threads get locked and entire comment chains removed without comment. Please understand that **it is your responsibility as a user to remain ""clean"" and contribute to this sub in a meaningful way.** Mods are not perfect and also operate under time constraints. 

- Appealing warnings and bans is only allowed via modmail, appeals via comments will be removed and ignored. **Do not PM mods about warnings/bans/post removals.** Please try to understand that mods will show little willingness to walk back on a punishment if your message is agitated, aggressive and uncivil. If you see any comments breaking the rules, please report them with the report button. A more extended version with explanations can be found on the subreddit wiki. 



- 1) **Civility.** Comments must be civil and respectful of other users. Ad hominem attacks, insults, flair-attacks, slander, etc. are impermissible. Do not ridicule opinions, personas, stances, or questions. 

- 2) **Editorialization.** The editorializing of titles to conform with these rules (especially tweets) is heavily encouraged. Inflammatory and biased wording is not allowed (incl: ""liberate"", ""terrorist"", ""hero""). Post/submission titles should thus be as informative and objective as possible. Exceptions can be made for *clearly marked quotes from individuals*. 

- 3) **Racism.** Any sort of racism or derogatory group-generalisation is not allowed. 

- 4) **Baiting.** Intentionally provocative or baiting comments targeting a particular user or the user-base are not allowed. This includes accusatory and inflammatory wording on comment (like: “butthurt” and “Are you serious?”). 

- 5) **Sarcasm and Cheerposting.** Light and friendly sarcasm is allowed. Excessive or mean-spirited sarcasm or snarkiness is not. Simple cheerposting, be it positive or negative, is not allowed. This includes insulting, judging or cheering for any side (RIP posts are allowed), player, or individual in the war. 

- 6) **Relevance and Derailing.** Any sort of derailing from the Syrian Civil War or issues directly related to it is not allowed. This includes the inner Turkey-PKK conflict, inner-US politics (“deep state”, the pro-Israel lobby). Exceptions will frequently be made for specific events. 

- 7) **Terminology.** Groups/factions/individuals have to be called as they'd call themselves. See clarification [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/7ca5jj/rule_7_clarification/). There will be no punishment for breaking only this rule.  

- 8) **Trivializing violence.** Dehumanising, death-wishing, and posts disrespecting the dead are not allowed. This includes joking or snarky comments and blame-trading. 

- 9) **Non-Substantive Comments.** Low-quality comments that contribute nothing to the conversation are heavily discouraged and will be removed. Borderline shitposting, strange formatting, memes and jokes, *talking/whining about votes and brigades* is not allowed unless specifically allowed. 

- 10) **Recruitment.** Any form of recruitment material concerning any party in the conflict is forbidden. A list of reputable charities can be found [in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/wiki/charities).

- 11) **AMA** Any sort of AMA should be coordinated with the mods beforehand. Do this by sending a modmail. 

- 12) **Media Personalities.** This subreddit is about the Syrian Civil War and the involved actors, which includes twitter users and commentators. Discussion and posts regarding their reporting on the war or anything that could influence their bias is allowed; anything about other social media activity or their private life is not.

- 13) **Timeliness.** This subreddit is for discussion of current up-to-date events. Refrain from posting old articles dealing with past issues even if it wasn’t posted back then when it was relevant. Articles dealing with older events but with newly emerged evidence or relevant facts are allowed. 


- 14) **Mod actions** Accounts of inflammatory and baiting user names and suspected alt accounts may be banned on sight by moderators.

Hijabis,10,"***
This is a place to engage in healthy discussions about Muslim women in Islam. **Please note that all posts on this subreddit are for WOMEN ONLY unless specifically marked that male participation is also welcome.**


""The best among you are those who have the best behavior."" -Muhammad (saw)

Proper adab is expected at all times. We encourage questions and different opinions but they must be expressed respectfully. We will ban you for being a jerk, being judgmental, or otherwise unsupportive. Even if a sister is doing something haraam, the expectation is that you will keep this as a safe space for her to make the right decisions on her own by not being judgmental. 

 The path to hijab is a difficult one and it is our goal to support the women who decide to take this path regardless of how far along they are on this journey. 

---
Questions and inquiries from non-Muslims are welcome!

---

**Subreddit Rules:**


**Rule 1: Respect is expected at all times**. 

Name-calling, being hostile to one another, attacking other users, attacking racial or religious groups, etc. will not be tolerated. This sub is intended to provide support to women who wear hijab and Muslimahs generally. It is not a debate sub. Please respect differences of opinion, avoid acrimonious arguments, and refrain from downvoting users simply because you practice differently. REPORT Islamically unsound advice or rulings without sources.

**Rule 2: All posts are for women only to answer UNLESS OP has used the ""Male and Female Participation"" flair**

All threads are by default for women-only, unless the specific ""male and female participation"" flair is used.

Threads can be posted by both men and women 

Non-flaired users will have their comments/posts removed. To receive a flair, do NOT message the mods. Post on [this thread to receive a flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/thm8cs/flair_thread_4_comment_here_to_get_a_flair/)


**Rule 3: No Stirring Drama**

Stirring drama is not allowed. Threads made to disparage individuals, users or subreddits will be removed.

**Rule 4: Women-friendly Space**

Keep in mind that this is a women-friendly space, therefore please extend your respect to all users and give special consideration to the fact that the subreddit is targeted towards women which would be the majority of the users.

This rule does not equate to man-hating. We expect respect towards both women and men in this subreddit.

**Rule 5: No Self-promotion**

Self-promotion is not allowed by default and should be limited: constantly posting your own blog posts will result in removal of posts.

**Rule 6: No Spam** 

No spamming on the subreddit; repeatedly posting the same question or content is not acceptable

**Rule 7: Citing Sources** 

You MUST cite your sources if you are giving rulings. Provide rulings and sources at all times.

**Rule 8: NP links when cross-linking**

When cross-linking to posts on other subreddits, np links are mandatory.

**Rule 9: No NSFW**

Sexually explicit or profane content in posts, comments, or via PM's will result in an immediate ban. Sisters who need information/have factual questions about sex, r/MuslimMarriage is a more appropriate sub. Exceptions must be approved by moderators prior to posting. Sisters who are being sexually harassed, please message the moderators.

**Rule 10: Rants are for the Monday rant threads only.**

Rants are to remain for the Weekly Monday Rant threads only.

**Rule 11: Moderators can remove posts at discretion.**

Moderators can remove posts at discretion.

>**Surah An-Noor, Verse 31:** And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah, that ye may attain Bliss. (English - Yusuf Ali)

-------------

>**Surah Al-Ahzab, Verse 59:** O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

----------------

>Hadith**Bukhari 6:282** '*Aisha used to say:* ""When (the Verse): 'They should draw their veils over their necks and bosoms,' was revealed, (the ladies) cut their waist sheets at the edges and covered their faces with the cut pieces.""

-----------------------------
**SUBREDDIT RULES**

**1) Is this the right place for you?** Being short doesn't qualify you to post here by itself. If you're here to show off your big boobs try BustyPetite or GoneWild instead. If you're here to show off your big booty try Asstastic. If you're here to show off your slender, small, petite female self then you're in the right place. Please make the post's focus on your ""petite-ness"", not about how big something is. No males will be allowed in any posts. Posts not falling into these guidelines will be removed

**2) Do not post pictures of other people.** This subreddit is for petite women posting themselves, no solo male or couple posts.

**3) No personal or confidential information.** If you post or attempt to guess names, locations, or other identifying information you will be banned without warning.

The sign should be crumpled and straightened out again before taking the photos. Do not edit or apply any filters to them. **You do not have to verify to post here (unless the mods ask) but it helps keep your posts out of the spam filter.**
NOTES: Please leave verification pictures up for reference. See general advice or Rule 1 to see if you qualify to post here.


**5) No spam or self-promotion.** Advertising goods or services for sale, asking for donations or promoting other social media accounts on the subreddit is not allowed. Please limit watermarks to only your Reddit username and posts to around 2 per day. Reposts and submitting the same image to a large number of subreddits are considered spam.

**7) No excessive editing** Excessive editing or photoshopping of posts will result in the post being removed.

Small edits that add to the context of the post will be allowed but if all you post is pictures with emojis covering the bits then your post will be removed.

**8) No negative or threatening comments** Violators will be banned without warning.
Report any comments or threads you find abusive. Do not ever respond to trolls.

#[Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/wiki/rules) <-click to see full rules

Observe the rules. This subreddit is actively moderated.

**This is not a place for debate, but for learning.**

#[Rules for Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/wiki/rules#wiki_questions)

1. State questions clearly in the title; both socialists and non-socialists may ask questions. Questions can be expanded upon in the text portion of the thread. Questions may be targeted toward a specific group, such as Anarchists, Marxist-Leninists, Mutualists, etc.. But unless otherwise stated, your questions are assumed to be directed toward all socialists.

2. Don’t Soapbox — You may expand upon your question, and ask follow-up questions in response to any answer you receive, but don’t use the forum as a platform to spread anti-communism. Similarly, polemic or trolling questions meant to start antagonistic arguments, provoke, or escalate disagreements to the level of insults will not be tolerated.

3. Don’t ask Loaded/Leading Questions — Don’t front-load a question with baseless assertions. We understand that knowledge is primarily made-up of background assumptions and preconceived notions that are part-and-parcel of Liberal ideology. Check those at the door, and don’t include them as part of your question unless your question cannot be addressed without them. (Bad Question: “It’s been proven that socialism doesn’t work, why do you support it?” – Good Question: “What lead you to support socialism?”)

4. Be confident when asking your question. There’s no such thing as a silly question, so don’t self-deprecate in your own thread by calling yourself, or your question, foolish.

5. Non-socialists may piggy-back on pre-existing threads to ask follow-up questions. Don't derail pre-existing threads with non-sequiturs.

#[Rules for Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/wiki/rules#wiki_answers)

1. If you’re not a socialist, don’t answer questions. Non-socialist answers will be removed, and repeated offenses lead to banning. People come to Socialism_101 looking for answers from socialists, not capitalists.

2. Refrain from making spurious or unverifiable claims. When answering questions, keep in mind that you may be asked to cite your sources. This is a learning subreddit, meaning you must be prepared to provide evidence, scientific or historical, to back up your claims. Link to appropriate sources when/if possible. An answer isn't good because it's *right*, it's good because it *teaches*.

3. Refrain from engaging in sectarian behaviour such as strawmaning, misrepresenting, or slandering rival factions/tendencies. Snide jabs at Anarchists if you’re a Marxist, or at Marxists if you’re an Anarchist, are not only contrary to the spirit of the sub, but counter-productive for the purpose of teaching. Where criticism is requested, do so in good faith and provide evidence for your assertion. If you disagree with a particular school of socialism, explain why if/when relevant.

4. Do provide book recommendations, Youtube channels, and free media when/where appropriate. [Check the Wiki]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/wiki/index) for the subreddit’s own suggestions.

#Rules for General Conduct

1.	As a Q&A sub, any linked threads with no discernible question will be removed. If you care to share a news story or make a statement please take it to our parent sub, r/socialism.

2.	Meta questions unrelated to Socialism_101 will be removed.

3.	Announcements, Participation Posts, Podcasts, or YouTube channels dedicated to learning may advertise only on approval of the Mod team. Posting without prior Mod approval will result in the thread being removed.

4.	Absolutely no oppressive speech of any kind. This includes but is not limited to racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, classist, ableist, islamophobic, orientalist, or any other form of systemic prejudice.


#Flair Policy

* If you feel you have expertise in a given topic relating to socialism, including but not limited to anarchism, Marxism, political economy, history, feminism, queer theory, or organizational praxis, feel free to self-assign a flair describing your area of expertise. Please only do so if you are confident that your knowledge in the area is at a high level.

* Flair may be removed at any time at the discretion of the moderators for breaking rules or failing to produce quality answers that live up to the standard of said expertise.

1. No low effort memes & duplicates.  Do not post content identical to, or closely-related to, content that was submitted in the last three months unless it adds context or new information.  This includes repetitive posts of popular memes.  Do not post low effort content including unoriginal memes, macros, or simple questions.
1. NSFW and Graphic Content - Do not post sexually explicit videos or images, gore, death, suicide attempts, or other similar content.  News sources that include such content are conditionally approved. NSFW content must be tagged.  Images and videos should follow Reddit's sitewide rules about doxxing.

The place for all things related to guitar pedals.

### **Posting rules:**

(everyone is expected to read these before posting, [more details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/about/rules/))

If you are new, please read [the page on rediquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

***  

* **1)** **Be kind to others.** Above anything else. Opinions posted are reflective only of the person posting them. You are entitled to your opinions, but remember that they are entitled to theirs. Be respectful, and don’t allow disagreements devolve into personal attacks. Hate speech, sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc will not be tolerated. Breaking this rule results in a ban.

* **2)** **No spam/advertising** allowed. What qualifies as spam? [Read about it here.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) We moderate by these rules. Spammers will be subject to a ban.

* **3)** **Gear posts not about pedals do not belong here.** No guitars, amps, packaging, pets, etc allowed in your pictures. We’re here to talk about the pedals. **You are responsible** for sparking that sort of discussion *(please see rules 4 and 5).* Check below for a list of related gear subs.

* **4)** **This is a discussion board, not Instagram.** For image/video posts of your pedals, it is **required** that you write your thoughts in the comments to help get the discussion going. If you've only just received a pedal, please **wait until you've actually played it** before making a NPD post. **Lazy and off-topic posts** will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Posts asking to Identify pedals are only allowed in the NSQ Megathreads.

* **5)** **We must be able to clearly see your pedals.** In board shots, please do not make your guitar/amp the focus of your post (see rules 3 and 4). Rig posts are not permitted outside of Rig Rundown weekends

* **6)** **No memes** please

* **7)** **No buying, selling, or trading.** Selling/trading pedals belongs in /r/letstradepedals, /r/Gear4Sale or /r/sellyourpedals. Please don’t link to your webstore, Reverb or otherwise, and do not post anything with the intention of soliciting customers from this community. 

* **8)** **Sound and video clips are very welcome!** We love to hear your pedals in action! Please do not link to any paid streaming service such as Apple Music, Spotify, or Bandcamp.

* **9)** Take all your **circle jerking shenanigans** to /r/guitarpedalsjerk.

* **10)** **Posts/comments that only serve to create drama**, bait trolls, cause controversy or other negative reactions, **whether intended or otherwise**, will be removed at the Mod's discretion.

If you see a post/comment that breaks the rules, please use the report button so we can take care of it.

Feel free to message the mods if you need any clarification or have a question :)

TittyDrop,10,"**Welcome to the ~~internet's~~ *world's* epicenter of titty dropping!**

###Please direct all discussion of new releases to the stickied megathread!###

**Follow /r/sneakers on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/TheSneakerSub) and [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/SneakerSub)!**

##Rules##

1.  Buying/selling/trading (or even asking about it/trades) is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**. There are other subreddits for that. Your comment/post will be removed, and you will be banned.

2. NO FAKES. No asking about fakes, no posting fakes. Any comment or post that features or advocates for fake/replica shoes of any kind will be removed and the poster will be banned.

3. No posts about bots, backdoor links, pre-order/add to cart services, etc. You will be banned without warning. What is and isn’t considered a backdoor link is at the discretion of the mods.

4. Follow Reddiquette and other sitewide rules. No referral links of any kind.

5. Keep discussion related to sneakers. Racist/sexist/bigoted comments will be removed and the poster banned at the mod's discretion.

6. Memes and low-effort posts will be removed at the mods’ discretion. **We do not allow LC's or ""What shoes should I get"" posts.** General sneaker recommendation posts such as comfortable standing shoes/general questions are still allowed. If a picture doesn't feature sneakers as the main focal point, it may be removed. We don't allow Slides, Flip-flops, Crocs, or non sneakers in the sub. Screenshots of pickups (Or L's) outside of new release threads will result in a ban.

7. Imgur is the preferred site to host images. Reddituploads often gives a 404 error after posting.

8. Don't pretend to be someone else. Give credit if it's not your picture.

9. **No advertising of any kind. No YouTube/Twitter/blog spam.** Refer to [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/wiki/rule10) for further info regarding this rule. Consult with the mods about promotional offers.

10. No posting personal information of any kind. This includes linking to social media accounts that aren't yours.

11.  Posts detailing customer service issues where the online company has defrauded you are allowed. The person making the post must provide adequate proof of the story they post (ie multiple pictures of shoes purchased, screenshots of conversations you have had with reps from the company etc). In cases that seem suspect or proof is not provided we will lock commenting on the post and sticky our reasoning. The thread can be unlocked by adding more proof.

AccidentalRenaissance,9,"##**Today's Photos on Yesterday's Canvas**

Welcome to /r/AccidentalRenaissance, the subreddit that showcases photographs that inadvertently resemble well-composed, Renaissance style art. 
&nbsp;
*************************************************************
###**What does Accidental Renaissance mean?**	

What we mean by Accidental Renaissance is a photo that inadvertently (accidentally) resembles a painting similar in composition, style, lighting, and/or subject to Renaissance-style art. 

We recognize there are many related art movements between the 14th and 19th centuries including: Baroque, Neo-classicism, Romantic, Dutch Golden Age, etc. All of these styles are appreciated and welcomed within this subreddit but please submit with flair indicating the style your submission/photo favors.

**Please visit the [Louvre website here](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/recherche?typology%5B0%5D=1&datingStartYear=1450&datingEndYear=1650) to view their collection of paintings from the 14th through mid-19th century**

&nbsp;

*************************

###What an AccidentalRenaissance photo **IS**: 

* A photo that *accidentally* resembles the types of art popular from the 14th-19th centuries. (It's the 'Renaissance' that is accidental, not the photo itself)
* A good quality photo that is high-resolution and in focus.
* **Composition**: Triangular/Pyramidal figures, Symmetrical or Dynamic, asymmetrical composition, mathematically composed, using foreshortening & linear perspective, and of course the use of the Fibonacci sequence or Golden Ratio. 
* **Lighting:** Natural-looking, diffused lighting, occasionally featuring use of sfumato (blurring/softening of outlines) and/or chiaroscuro (strong contrasts between light and dark), often imparting a characteristic ""glow"" that makes figures seem to be lit from within.
* **Subject:** Landscapes, people, scenes, that feature the above. 
&nbsp;

###What an AccidentalRenaissance photo is **NOT**: 

* A really cool/artistic photo of your favorite **pet/child/sports team.** 
* A photo of one or more people reaching out toward something or someone like in **Creation of Adam.**
* A group of people seated around or behind a table like in **The Last Supper.**
* A photo of your **drunk buddy or group of buddies** or **drunken fights**.
* A photo of your favorite (or *least* favorite!) **politician campaigning for office.**
* A snapshot of someone **sleeping or passed out.** 
* That one popular photo making the rounds on Reddit.
* A super hilarious pic of a bunch of **people at a party, a bar, your basement, a concert**. 
* A moody pic of the crowd at your favorite concert or club.
* A **video or gif.** 

&nbsp;

***********************************************************

###**We ask that you please read the following simple suggested rules prior to your submission:**

1. Each submission must be a direct image link and only be sourced from the [mod-approved site list](https://old.reddit.com/r/AccidentalRenaissance/comments/p1wddt/updated_list_of_approved_websites_for_submissions/?).

**Subreddit Rules**
=============
 *Users may be subject to temporary bans for breaking any of the main [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/wiki/index), at the sole discretion of the moderators.*

* **This is not a marketplace.** Buying, selling, transferring, trading, begging or wagering for coins, players, real money, accounts or digital items is not allowed. Posting anything related to coin buying or selling will result in a ban.

* **Don't be an asshole.** Posts and comments consisting of racist, sexist, xenophobic or homophobic content will be removed, regardless of popularity or relevance. Pictures showing personal information or anything that could lead to doxxing or witch-hunting will not be allowed. Click-baits, shitposts and trolling will not be tolerated and will result in an immediate ban. Treat others how you would like to be treated.

* **Personal Attacks.** We are 100% in favor of critical and constructive posts and comments as long as they are not aimed towards a specific person. Any direct or indirect attack to members of the FIFA community are strictly prohibited.

* **We're not your free advertising or here to pay your bills.** Using the subreddit's subscriber base for financial gain is not allowed. Apps, websites, streams, Youtube channels or any other external source to Reddit cannot be advertised or linked. Giveaways promoting another medium (retweet to enter, subscribe to win, etc.) are not allowed. If you wish to advertise, you can do so through reddit. Read what Reddit considers to be acceptable self-promotion [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). 

* **This isn't /r/soccer or /r/memes.** Let's keep this sub related to the FIFA videogame and not about real world soccer news/videos outside of our designated weekend IF threads. Memes are not allowed either. If your post includes content not directly extracted from the game, it will be removed.
* **Automatic Removal.** The [following topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/wiki/index#wiki_subreddit_rules) will be automatically removed by the moderation team due to user feedback, low effort and repetitiveness.

* **If you see something that isn't right, report it.** Clicking the report button under the post is the fastest way to helps us catch anything that might be in violation of the rules. Send a message to [mod mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFIFA) before posting if you have questions about what is and isn't allowed.

* **We reserve the right to remove a post if it is against [the game's TOS](https://help.ea.com/en/help/fifa/fifa-rules/)**

##### Subreddit Rules

1. **DO NOT MAKE A POST CONTAINING RANK UP QUESTIONS, AWAKENING QUESTIONS, TEAM BUILDING QUESTIONS, CRYSTAL OPENINGS, OR OTHER TYPES OF BRAG POSTS** (INFORMATIONAL BRAGGING IS ALLOWED). A WEEKLY [STICKIED THREAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContestOfChampions/about/sticky/) IS POSTED WHERE YOU CAN POST ALL BRAGS AND CRYSTAL IMAGES/VIDEOS, AND ALL TEAM BUILDING QUESTIONS ([more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContestOfChampions/comments/9v51cv/announcement_regarding_braposts_crystal_openings/)).

2. Be civil to one another, both here and in game. Let's attempt to encourage a well mannered community for this game. *This includes verbal attacks, whether or not the previous party is in the wrong or not.*

3. Please no soliciting of any sort. This includes attempts to sell accounts.

4. No how-to hack guides or links to hacking programs. 

5. Let's not criticize one another for spending or not spending money in game. Similarly, let's not criticize one another for playing Arenas (or any other game mode) heavily. Friendly discussion/debate is fine, but remember rule #2.

6. ***IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO JOIN AN ALLIANCE OR RECRUIT FOR YOU OWN ALLIANCE, PLEASE POST IN /r/ContestOfChampionsLFG.***

7. Reddit as a whole has a **Self Promotion Rule**, which has a guideline of 9:1, this is to say that only 10% of what you post or comment should be related to content that you've produced. More on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). ***On this sub***, you are allowed to post self promotion, but you **must** follow that 9:1 principle. Moderators can make exceptions for **informational content, if not in excess**. ***If the content is primarily a crystal opening or rank up it will be deemed a BRAGPOST and be removed.***

**FAILING TO FOLLOW THE RULES *WILL* RESULT IN CONSEQUENCES**.

JustUnsubbed,5,"This sub is for sharing which post made you unsubscribe from a subreddit. Other acceptable posts can be of permalinked comments from other users saying that ""this is the post that made me unsubscribe from /r/(insert sub here)."" 

Rules/guidelines:

1. Don't be a dick. You might get a warning, you might get banned, depending on the severity of your dick-behavior. Also don't /u/ summon people if you're going to trash them.

2. If you're posting a link to a post, try to explain why that particular post made you unsubscribe from that particular subreddit in your post title. That will not only be informative, but it'll prevent stale post titles.

3. The title/post flair MUST include the subreddit name.

4. Do not participate in the linked threads. Vote brigading is not allowed sitewide, so don't do it. **Users who brigade/come from other subreddits to downvote and post dickish comments will be banned.** If you see comments that look like a brigade, **PLEASE REPORT THEM.**

5. Posting that you unsubbed from this subreddit might sound clever, but it's not really. If you make this post it will result in a ban. **ALSO, NO JOKE POSTS (puns, jokes, spam, intentional shitposting, etc)**


6. Remember, this is **NOT** /r/shitpost. Don't just post other shitposts without saying if/that you unsubscribed. If your post is like one that would better belong on /r/shitpost, it may get removed. You may resubmit your post in the correct format. 

7. Please include the subreddit you are unsubbing from in the title or in flair for your post. Failure to do so may result in your post being removed.

8. Do not use /r/JustUnsubbed to intentionally provoke other subs/communities/promote agendas. We aren't your personal battle ground. Do not /u/ summon people to trash them.

snowboarding,8,"**Shreddit** - For snowboarders & those who love snowboards.


We try to keep /r/snowboarding a friendly place for riders of all skill levels. **Please be sure to read the sidebar before posting.** As much as we love helping each other out, we really hate repeating ourselves.

RULES

- Please **use the [DAILY DISCUSSION](http://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/search?q=Daily+Discussion&sort=new&restrict_sr=on) thread for general Q&A** about gear and skills/technique, and any requests for opinions or help, especially for newbie-related questions. **If your thread is removed without explanation, it's most likely because it should be posted there.**

- The general rule is photo and video submissions to /r/snowboarding should be of **people actually riding on snowboards**. If you want to submit a picture of your gear or where you ride, please use the Daily Discussion.

- **NO MEMES:** even if the meme in question shows actual snowboarding, memes are not allowed in the sub.

- **KEEP IT CIVIL:** Heated discussions are fine, but hate speech and unwarranted ad hominem attacks may be grounds for a ban. 

- **SELLING YOUR GEAR?** For sale/trade posts are allowed, but all of the relevant information (description, pictures, location, price/terms) must be posted up front. Also, no repeat posts, please.

- **FOR BEGINNERS:** You're welcome to post here, following the rules, but you can also head over to /r/snowboardingnoobs to ask questions. Also, the search function is your friend. We're 99% sure that someone has already asked the same question you have.

- **NO SPAM:** As is the policy for all Reddit communities, spam is forbidden. 
- **QUESTIONS?** If you have a question about the rules, send a *polite* message to the mods and we'll look into it (provide the link to the thread in question too). None of us are paid for this and we're less likely to be lenient with rules if you're an entitled brat about it. It's regrettable that this has to be said explicitly, but a large number of messages we receive are like this. 

Lastly, this is worth repeating since this is something that we have to constantly clarify (99% of modmail is about this): **If your thread was removed without explanation, it most likely belongs in the Daily Discussion Thread.**

**70% of the title has to specifically describe what the food is.** Backstory to the food / where the ingredients come from (leftover, last nights, home grown) do not fall within the 70% and must only take up 30% of the title. 

* Titles worded to solicit votes directly or indirectly will be removed. The titles must have one (1) tag. No emojis or all caps, please.

**Add a Tag at the Front of Your Title.**

 * The available tags are:

 **[I ate]** - food you ate in a restaurant 

 **[Homemade]** - food you made at home

 **[Pro/Chef]** - food you made if you work in the food industry

**No Low-Quality Posts or Comments.**

* We don't allow any:

 Non-OC posts *Original Content=OC*

 Self-promotion

 Blog links

 Dietary activism

 Politics

 Videos

 Watermarks/Superimposed Text

 Chain/Pre-Packaged Food

**""Be Nice""**

* Please be respectful and don't call other users (and their food) derogatory words. We enforce Redditquette.

**Linking to YouTube in Comments.**

* Linking YouTube videos is allowed, as long as the video complies with the following:

 The channel must have at least 100,000 subscribers.

 The video must be directly related to food.

**No abusive circlejerks**

* As an extension of the ""Be Nice"" rule, abusive circlejerks will be subject to removal and/or a ban. This can result in an immediate permanent ban depending on the severity. 

* Current abusive circlejerks:
    * Melt circlejerk (on grilled cheese posts)
    * Not a burger circlejerk (on Chicken burger posts)
    * Sweden vs Iced cinnamon buns circlejerk
    * Italy vs non-traditional pasta/pizza circlejerk

Any lists are non-exhaustive.

**Guidelines**
-----------------------------
 **BEFORE POSTING HERE, PLEASE READ [THIS GUIDE](/r/tipofmytongue/comments/pv67p/hopefully_some_useful_tips_on_how_to_find_what/) on how to find what you need using regular means!**


**[Subreddit Rules](/r/tipofmytongue/about/rules/)**
-----------------------------

**1. Be civil and respectful to each other.**

Act in good faith on this subreddit, posts and answers. Try not to waste people's time. No trolling or shitposts here.

**2. No arbitrary link titles (How to answer including a link)**

Include a description of what you are linking to in case the link breaks. Do not use URL shorteners, Tumblr, or partner links, these are all automatically removed.

**3. Do not repeat something already suggested.**

The OP does not need to be overwhelmed with multiple suggestions of the same thing.  If you have replied with the same thing as someone else did earlier, you should delete your comment.

**4. Reply “Solved!” to the first correct answer**

When what you’re looking for is found, reply Solved! in reply to the first (oldest) comment that gave you the answer.

**5. Do not delete post/answer**

Do not delete your answer after it has been acknowledged. Do not delete your post. People are interested in what has been asked for, what has been suggested, and want to see what has been found.

**6. No reposting within one week.**

Wait one week before reposting a question (Please link to your old posts to rule out previous suggestions)

**7. Music posts**

Make it easy for people to help you by recording a vocaroo or providing an online synthesiser recording of your music. Describing musical notes as text without including a vocaroo or other playable link will get your post removed - this includes “do doo dooo” or other attempts at written music notation, including Solfège. This applies even if the singer doo-doo-doo’s the melody in the song. If there is a similar song to the one you are looking for, provide a link to that.

**8. No People**

No posts such as “who is this person”. Actors/actresses and historical figures who are not common knowledge within the public domain are off limits. This rule will generally be handled on a case by case basis.

**9. Nothing Illegal**

No TOMT posts looking for Warez or requests for anything illegal. This includes any streams for movies or sports or anything of that nature. Torrents, trackers, piracy, etc.

**10. No NSFW Posts**

No porn. Use /r/tipofmypenis for porn. No gore or animal violence. Please note that horror films (simulated gore) are ok, provided they have a NSFW tag.

**11. Post format**

You can only ask one question per post, and your post title must start with [TOMT] - i.e. [TOMT][MOVIE][1990s] Movie about a kid who befriends an alien. Use a date range if you need to - nobody knows when you were a kid. Include your home country if relevant, i.e. if you are looking for a regional TV show.

**12. No bribes**

Do not offer rewards in the post as an attempt to publicise your post. You can reward people once the post is solved if you wish.

**13. Participation**

Comment on your post for it to be approved.

The poster must comment on their post to make it visible in the subreddit, and to acknowledge the subreddit rules. Use this comment to add anything else you need to. Posts submitted but not commented on after 60 minutes will be removed. Reply to suggestions made as frequently as possible - do not abandon your post!

DrunkOrAKid,7,"This subreddit is for stories of the greatest stupidity.  Inspired by How I Met Your Mother, this subreddit was created for the purpose of hearing amusing stories and having other try to guess if you were drunk or a kid.

**Rules**

1. Try to shorten your story so that it will fit in the headline. I am not, however, going to create any rules that state that you can't go more in-depth in your post.  If you have a great story that fits what this subreddit is all about, share it, that's what we're all here for in the first place.

2. You no longer need to comment with drunk and kid yourself. Bots will do it for you.

3. **Please include the correct answer in your post. Hide your answers using the following syntax: `>!Answer!<`. There should be NO SPACE between the ! and your text. It will show up like this: >!Answer!<. It's a good idea to put your answer in a sentence so it's not immediately obvious by its length. For example, "">!kid!<"" is a lot more obvious than "">!I was a kid when this happened!<""**

4. Comments that contain or reference the answer should also include a spoiler tag

\>! No
\>!Yes"
thalassophobia,1,"Pictures and videos, fiction or real, related to the deep dark water that make us really uncomfortable.

###If you see a repost, please report it!

**thalassophobia** - fear of being in large bodies of water, fear of the vast emptiness of the sea, of sea waves, and fear of distance from land

**megalohydrothalassophobia** - fear of large things in the water

We have both!
________________________________

Look out for the ""Exemplary"" flair! We the mods give this flair to all the links which we believe are in line with our idea for what the content for /r/thalassophobia is supposed to look like!

######[View Exemplary Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/thalassophobia/search?q=flair%3A%27Exemplary%27&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)

___

**Subreddit rules.**

**1. Only thalassophobia related posts and titles**

If you’re posting something, ask yourself: Is it triggering my thalassophobia (fear of vast and/or deep bodies of water) or is it triggering a different sort of fear? Make sure your title highlights thalassophobia - see rule 3.

**2. Restrictions on sea life**

Sea life is permissible as long as it isn't the main focus of the content. Generally speaking, you should not post pictures with sea life as the main focus. A shark swimming calmly next to a diver is not a suitable post for this sub, neither is a shark having a seal for lunch. If it is the main focus, it also has to emerge unexpectedly from nothing. Absolutely NO dubbed in noises (this usually applies to whales).

Posting sea life is also okay under megalohydrothalassophobia (fear of large water creatures) criteria:

* It must not dominate the picture/video or be the sole factor of fear.
* It should serve the purpose of demonstrating the scale and vastness of the body of water (i.e. Holy CRAP, that giant thing can hide in the water??).

**3. Use proper titles**

Any posts with just “Nope” as a title will be automatically removed. Don’t do that. Just don’t. Same with “That’s a nope from me”. Just avoid the word “nope”. Furthermore, titles in the spirit of “OMG SO CREEPY” or emojis will also be removed.

Your title should highlight the thalassophobic nature of the post rather than any sea creature in the post. For example, if you're posting a video of a shark, we're not interested in the shark itself, we're interested in the massive blue void of nothingness behind him. Titles focusing on sea creatures will be removed.

**4. No jokes, memes, or cartoons**

While we all love a good laugh, it isn’t specifically what we’re looking for in this sub. Thalassophobia-related artwork is okay as long as it adheres to all the other rules.

**5. Be nice and courteous**

Seriously, there’s seldom a need to be nasty. There’s absolutely no need to be nasty on this sub. So don’t be.

**6. No reposts**

Reposts will be monitored within a 90 day window. We will also be maintaining a list of retired submissions that have been posted so much that they have been retired to the ""Thalassophobia Hall of Fame"" to never be posted again...

**7. No gore**

Absolutely no gore is allowed on this subreddit, not animals, not people, nothing.

For additional information, including enforcement, please see our [rules wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/thalassophobia/wiki/rules).

***
###Some guidelines


#####Posting

* **Be informative**. If requesting advice, explain your situation as best you can so that users have something to work with. 

* **If posting an image**, make sure the title is informative and clear in how it relates to frugality, and follow it up with a top level comment with details.

* **If posting something you made**, leave a top level comment explaining how or why you went about it, how much it cost, how much time it took, and share the recipe or materials needed. 

* **Removed posts** will include flair indicating why it was removed. 

 Depending on the removal reason, posts and comments may be reinstated if edited. 

 **If you have questions about a removal or wish to request reinstatement**, message the moderators.

#####Commenting
* Everyone has their own definition of frugality, and reason for being frugal. 

 Discuss and debate, but don't fight over it, or be condescending to those who do not share your particular view on frugality.

* Remember that not everyone lives where you live. Stores, products, prices and resources all vary by location. What's good for you might not be good for others, and vice versa. 

* Don't be baited into violating the rules. Report infractions and let the mods handle it. 

* Observe [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

shortscarystories,8,"####Please read the rules of subreddit before posting stories: [Posting Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/dpc7ky/the_rules_of_the_sub_please_read_before_posting/)

##[ShortScaryStoriesOOC](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystoriesooc)

Because sometimes the scariest stories, are those that leave us to our imagination.

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)
* /r/ShortScaryStoriesOOC for all SSS related discussion.    

Note: All stories submitted to r/ShortScaryStories belong to the original poster. If you fail to ask permission before narrating, translating, producing, or sharing their post to another page/website, the original poster may file a DMCA strike against you. This means that they will be able to have their content removed from your page. If several authors file DMCA strikes against you, most sites will remove your page completely.

If you would like to ask for permission to narrate, translate, produce, or share a user's story to another site/webpage, you must do so in PMs. Asking for this permission in a comment on the post is considered out of character, and such comments will be removed.

Have you found stories shared/narrated without author permission? Report it on /r/SleeplessWatchdogs!
    
>### Rules

1. All stories must be 500 words or less. A story that is 501 words (or two sentences or less, to distinguish us from r/twosentencehorror) will be removed. The go-to source that mods use to check stories is www.wordcounter.net. Be aware that formatting can artificially increase the word count without your knowledge; any discrepancy between what your document says and what the mod sees on wordcounter.net will be resolved in favor of wordcounter.net. In the same vein, all of the story must be in the post itself, and not be carried on in the title of the story or in the comment section.

2. Stories **cannot** have links in them. This is meant to reduce distractions. Any story with a link in it will be removed.

3. Tags are reserved for Contests or Challenges and SSS posts disguised as posts from other subreddits. Otherwise, there is no need to add tags to a post. Stories with tags will be removed and re-submissions will be required. We do not require trigger warnings here as other rules cover subject matters which may be harmful to readers. Additionally, emojis and other non-text items are not allowed in the title.

4. No Non-Story Text Within the Story. No comments about it being your first post, or repeating the title within the story text, no side mentions of your inspiration. Just the narrative by itself. You have the comment section to host any commentary you have on it.

5. No multi-part stories, no sequels, prequels, interquels, alternative viewpoint stories, links to previous stories for reference, or anything that builds off of or depends on some other story you’ve written. The story begins and ends within the 500 words or less you are allotted.

6. Self-Promotion can only be done in the comment section of the story. Authors may **only** link to personal subreddits, other subreddits, and YouTube narrations of the work currently posted. Links to sales sites such as Amazon or posts with the intent of generating sales are **strictly forbidden.** We no longer allow links to outsides websites like blogs, author websites, or anything else. 

7. We ask that authors focus on creating stories within horror and thriller stories. You may borrow from other genres, but the main focus of the story **MUST** be to horrify, scare, or unsettle. Stories with jokey punchline will be removed. We shouldn't be laughing at the end of the story. Stories dealing with depression, suicide, mental illness, medical ailments, and other assorted topics belong over on /r/ShortSadStories. However, this doesn't mean you cannot use these topics in your stories. There's a delicate balance between something horrifying and sad. If we can interpret the story as being scary, we will do so. Please note that badly written stories, don't necessarily fall under this category. The story can be terrible, but still be focused on horror. 

8. All stories must be an original work. If someone can find your story somewhere else, it will be removed. This rule also applies to famous or common stories that you’ve merely reworded slightly. This does not apply to famous stories you’ve reworked considerably, such as a fresh take on a fairytale or urban legend. No fan fiction allow. Stories based on copyrighted materials will be removed as well. The rule of thumb is that the original your story is, the safer you'll be.

9. Rape/Pedophilia/Bestiality/Torture Porn/Gore Porn are Off-Limit Topics. The intent of this ban is to prevent bad actors from exploiting this sub as a delivery system for their fantasies, which would bring the tone down, and alienate the reader base who don’t want to be exposed to such material. We acknowledge that this ban throws out the baby with the bath water, as well-made stories that merely happen to have such themes will get removed as well. But if we let in the decent stories with such content, those bad actors can point at them and demand to know why those stories get to stay and not theirs. Better by far to head the issue off entirely with a hard ban and stick to it.

10. Authors must wait 24 hours between submissions. This is intended to prevent prolific writers from crowding out others from the front page by spamming the sub. It is likely if you mistime it, you’ll be able to copy/paste and resubmit your story once the 24 hours has passed.

11. We reserve the right to remove any story that fails to use proper grammar, has frequent typos, or is in general just a poorly composed story. This is relative, and we will use that right as sparingly as possible.

12. This includes, but is not limited to: bigotry/hate speech, personal insults, exceptionally low quality feedback, antagonistic behavior, use of slurs, etc. Use your best judgement. Mod response will take the form of a spectrum ranging from a mild warning to a permaban, depending on the context. Incidentally, the lowest response we have to mod abuse is banning, because we quite literally don’t need to put up with it.


A few additional notes:

If you have an issue that you need to address or a question for us, please contact us over modmail. That said, mod decisions are final; badgering or spamming us with messages over and over about the same subject will not change our minds, but it can easily get you banned.

If you see a story or comment that breaks these rules, please hit the report button. This will help us maintain a tightly focused and enjoyable sub for everyone.

We reserve the right to lock any thread that veers off topic into some controversial subject, such as politics or social commentary. This is simply not the venue for it.

Meta commentary and questions about the sub can be made at /r/ShortScaryStoriesOOC

AskCulinary,10,"Welcome to /r/AskCulinary where we provide expert guidance for your specific cooking problems to help people of all skill levels become better cooks, to increase understanding of cooking, and to share valuable culinary knowledge.  
___
**Here's our [FAQ](/r/AskCulinary/wiki/faq). Please check it before posting!**  

**[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/wiki/index) are some of our most popular discussions and a few other odds and ends.  Check it too!**
___
Keep Questions:

**Specific** (Have a goal in mind!)

**Detailed** (Include the recipe, pictures etc.)  

This will ensure you get the best answers. 

Please avoid requests for recipes for specific ingredients or dishes (unless it's obscure and Google has failed you).

Prompts for general discussion or advice are discouraged outside of our official Weekly Discussion (for which we're happy to take requests). As a general rule, if you are looking for a variety of good answers, go to /r/Cooking. For the one right answer, come to /r/AskCulinary. 

We're also avoiding brand recommendations or comparisons for kitchen equipment. Kitchen equipment preferences tend to be subjective and personal. Few people have enough experience with multiple brands to make useful comparisons. 

We're best at:

* Troubleshooting dishes/menus
* Equipment questions (about specific items with specific problems)
* Food science
* Questions about technique

Questions about what is healthy and unhealthy are outside of the scope of this subreddit. But if you have a culinary question that takes into account some specified dietary needs, we'll do our best to help.

Food safety questions are difficult for us to answer, so please instead see [USDA's](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation) topic portal, the [StillTasty](https://www.stilltasty.com/) website, and if in doubt, throw it out. 

There are also better subs for professional questions. We focus on helping home cooks here. If you have questions about the business, we will refer you to /r/chefit or /r/KitchenConfidential, and wish you luck. 

If you see a wrong answer, report it. Food and cooking are subjective, but as a community, we don't want to spread bad information if we can help it. 

Not sure if your post fits? [Ask the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskCulinary).
___
Commenting:

* Be **Factual and Helpful**
* Be **Thorough**
* Be **Respectful**

In your comments please **avoid**:

* **Abuse**
* **Jokes**
* **Chatter**
* **Speculation**
* **Links without Explanations**

We ask that all top level (a.k.a. parent) comments responding directly the post be attempts to answer the question posed. If a post raises further questions that you'd like answers, please post them separately.

As a general rule, being wrong is not a removable offense for a comment. However, if the misinformation is dangerous or is crowding out correct information, the mods may remove it. 

If a comment or post does not adhere to these guidelines, please use the **""REPORT""** link beneath the comment or post to notify the mods.

*****

**Rules & Guidelines**

**1.** Cats! Post pictures of your cats, talk about cats, ask questions, get advice.

**2.** We prefer that if you post photos, it be of your own cat(s) or one(s) you personally know. If clearly stated, photos of cat(s) you don't know is allowed, within reason. **Lying and claiming/posting someone else's cat is/as your own will result in an immediate ban, with no warnings given.**

**3.** No NSFW content and no animal abuse/cruelty.

**4.** No titles asking for upvotes (e.g. ""This cat didn't get any love in /r/aww"", ""it's my cake day"", ""my first post here"", ""any love for ..."").

**5.** Links asking for funding, competition votes or advertisement will be removed (see the list of subreddits below for a possible alternative).

**6.** Be civil. We have a strong, bright-line policy against insults, namecalling or harassment, and will ban you without notice for such conduct. **If a photo has a person in it along with a cat, don't even think of being creepy or rude to that person. This includes any comments on people's appearance, either positive or negative!**

**7.** Do not post personal information (this includes Facebook links as it can be easily traced back).

**8.** No meme, image macro, low-effort content. Original content is preferred. No image macros, memes, or similar low-effort content. You might want to check out r/MEOW_IRL and r/Catmemes for that.

**9.** Recent/Egregious reposts : Repost of recent or currently popular post from another subreddit for the purpose of farming karma (Rule 10).

**10.** Reposts are allowed (and crossposts are too, don't confuse them!), within reason.

**11.** No posts asking what gender your cat is, ask a vet!

**12.** 'Name my cat/kitten' posts are allowed, but require the correct flair + verification to ensure OC. You must set the flair of your post to 'Name Request' at the time of submission, failing to do so is in breach of this rule. Please submit your post before sending us a modmail - your submission will trigger an automated message which will contain the instructions required for your post to be approved.Your verification message will be left unanswered if you send us a modmail before you have submitted your post for us to review.


**13.** Mourning (RIP) posts are allowed. If you do not wish to see them, there are several filters in the sidebar to prevent them from appearing to you.


**14.** Merchandise posts are an instant, unreversable bannable offense. No, we don't care if you've contributed to the subreddit before or not. Post any merchandise, you will be banned forever and we will not reverse it. We're here for your feline friends, not your merchandise. 


**The moderators of this subreddit are not responsible for any medical advice given and we suggest that you don't follow or post it. Go see a vet! Please do not give medical advice to posters if you are not a medical professional with experience treating cats.**

Some of these rules are based upon [Reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), [Reddit's TOS](http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement) and [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

>1. Only Gif/HTML5 links please. No sound, videos or pictures. The preferred sites for gifs to be hosted on are [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or [gyfcat](http://gfycat.com/). These are reliable sources and thus we would love if you hosted your gifs using these sites.

>2. Provide source if there is one. We won't go hunting you down, but at least be considerate of the creator.

>3. Your title must be informative of what is going on in the gif, instead of the good ole ""Look at this gem"" or ""Just a wheel"". They can be funny, but just consider this.

>4. Any post that has been submitted in the past 3 months **or** is in the top 100 of all time **cannot** be reposted and will be removed. Please report rule breaking posts.

>5. If you feel that any ruling is unfair/not correct, or if you have any other questions, feel free to [message the /r/educationalgifs mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Feducationalgifs).

#The Rules:

 ||
:-:|:-:
Follow reddit rules/reddiquette| This is a given.
New music guidelines| Only songs and videos released within the last 30 days can be posted. Check beforehand to make sure a song hasn't already been submitted. The subreddit only allows [FRESH] music after it has been officially released in the United Kingdom. This mainly refers to Friday releases; other posts are generally released worldwide. Always remember to use the 'Artist - Song' title format. Music videos must have premiered on YouTube to be posted.
No illegal media|Do not post illegal streams or downloads of songs/albums. Asking for or posting instructions on how you can get it is also not allowed. These are banned on reddit sitewide, and sharing such material endangers our whole community. If it was an honest mistake, please message us; we'll try to be as lenient as possible.
Non-newsworthy posts|Please only submit pop music news-related articles, videos, images or links that are topical and noteworthy. Though posts such as articles, videos, links or pictures consisting of non-newsworthy content will be removed, they are always welcome to be posted in the General Discussion or Daily Music Discussion. **Articles and links are prioritized over screenshots for news.**
Pop music?|We are purposely vague on what we consider pop, because it's a difficult genre to define. Usually we'll try to focus on more mainstream pop, but **pop-adjacent artists are allowed**. In general, the mods trust you all to post relevant music. Music will generally not be removed by a moderator unless it is deemed shitposty or too irrelevant to the subreddit. This rule is subject to moderator discretion, but **if you feel a removed post was relevant please notify us**!
Stale topics | Topics on our Stale Topics list are banned as they have been discussed many times. [Please see here for our stale topics.](/r/popheads/wiki/index/stale-topics#st) Certain [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/stale-topics#wiki_banned_comments) are also banned to increase the quality of discussion. Stale topics are constantly changing, and it is ultimately up to the discretion of the moderators whether a topic is stale or not.
Keep things civil | Please do not come here for the sole reason of harassment/flaming. Keep things civil. Use of discriminatory language isn't appreciated. Don't make gross sexual comments. Posts that appear to be baiting arguments will be removed. Please keep negative ""stan-twitter""-isms on stan twitter. **Attacking other users will warrant a ban.**
Tabloid material|This subreddit forbids tabloid material that focuses on non-newsworthy drama, sensationalist content, and/or dubious sources. In order for gossip to be considered newsworthy, it must either be reported on by a major, reliable news source or have been addressed by the artist in question. Please redirect your content to the daily gossip megathread, Teatime with Popheads. Please do not editorialize article or interview titles except for cases of major announcements.
Self-promotional content|Do not post your own original music/articles/blog posts/covers on the subreddit. The only condition which this would be allowed is if you have shown interest in participating in /r/popheads in the past, or if you are posting an original writing piece directly to the subreddit in a text post. These types of posts will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Otherwise, do not use /r/popheads purely for self-promotion. 
Post formatting|Flairs are NOT manually typed in the thread title – please select the flair either during or after submitting by clicking on the flair button that looks like a little dog tag and choosing the adequate option. Also, make sure to use the Artist - Title format in the titles of your submissions.
Low effort discussions|Discussion posts should try to foster discussion. Any discussion posts that ask for recommendations, help to make a playlists, or only ask for people to name songs/albums/artists that fit a certain criteria will be redirected to the Daily Music Discussion thread. Also, the body of the text post must encourage discussion or offer the original poster's thoughts.

#Use the tags:

* **FRESH**: New songs released in the last 30 days. If an album or song is region locked (meaning that it isn't available until Midnight in your region), please wait until after it's been released **in the UK** (which typically is Midnight GMT (UTC+0) but Midnight BST (UTC+1) during Daylight Savings) to post it. Each user may only post multiple [FRESH] streams 10 minutes apart. 

* **FRESH ALBUM**: Same rules as [FRESH] apply, but this is to be used for albums and mixtapes. The 10 minute rule applies too.

* **FRESH EP**: Same as above but with EPs. 

* **FRESH VIDEO**: Newly released music videos.

* **PERFORMANCE**: New live performances from recent awards/TV shows. Only official sources are allowed, i.e. the official YouTube channel of the award/TV show, so **no fan footage**. 

* **NEWS**: Newly released info by **official** artist sources or news publications.

* **ARTICLE**: Non-news related links, such as interviews, reviews, or other write-ups. Videos will be included under this until we figure out something that isn't useless.

* **DISCUSSION**: Thought-provoking posts that start discussions. Please write something in the textbox to kick off the discussion (e.g. suggesting examples or providing your own opinion), don't just pose a question. This is **not for links.**

* **LEAK**: Thread announcing that a project has leaked. Discussing the leaks is fine, but **no links**. Illegal links are banned sitewide on reddit. 

* **ORIGINAL**: Links to your own material that you'd like to share with the subreddit. Only OC from regular members will be allowed.

* **SERIOUS**: For any content with sensitive subject matter. No joking or memes allowed in the comments.

Special flairs:

* **WEEKLY**: Only to be used on mod-approved weekly threads. See the thread schedule.

* **ANNOUNCEMENT**: Official statements from the moderators.

* **RATE** and **RATE REVEAL**: Threads for the monthly rates, posted by the hosts.

* **MEGATHREAD**: All-encompassing threads accommodating important/notable releases or events. If you would like to create a megathread please ask through modmail.

* **GAME**: Informal, fun threads. *Please ask the moderators through modmail for permission to host these*.

* ####  Tags are **NOT** manually typed in the thread title – please select the flair after submitting by clicking on the 'flair' button and choosing the adequate option

## Rules

1. Be nice
2. Posts must be questions about anthropology. No hypothetical, homework, or dinosaur questions.
3. Comments must be informed, on topic, and based in anthropological research. No speculative or anecdotal answers are allowed.
4. Be prepared to cite your sources.

## What is anthropology?

Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity as a whole: our nature and our culture, our past and our present.

### [Biological anthropology](#flair-biological)

Biological anthropology is the study of human evolution and physical diversity. It encompasses palaeoanthropology (the study of human fossils), primatology (the study of nonhuman primates), human population genetics and forensic anthropology.

### [Sociocultural anthropology](#flair-cultural)

Sociocultural anthropology is the study of human cultural diversity. It originated in written accounts of non-European cultures in exotic locales (ethnography), but today sociocultural anthropologists use the ethnographic method to document and study societies all around the world.

### [Linguistic anthropology](#flair-linguistic)

Linguistic anthropology is the study of how language shapes cultural life. Linguistic anthropologists document language as it is spoken rather than approaching it as static and set. They also study language acquisition, body language, the symbolism of language, and language as performance. 

### [Archaeology](#flair-archaeology)

Archaeology is the study of past peoples through the things they left behind. It is our main source of evidence about human societies before the existence of written records (prehistory), but can be used to study any period from the emergence of our species to the present day.

#Welcome!#

Welcome to the usenet invites subreddit. This is a sister reddit to /r/Usenet. Please read over the rules before contributing. We only have a few but they are important.

#Rules#

1. **No pirated content**.

2. This subreddit is **for sharing usenet related invites only.** No account requests/offers, no non-usenet invites.

3. **No trading, buying, or selling.** It is not acceptable to trade, buy, or sell invites.  Please share what you have freely.  
 * Posts that contain both an offer and a request for invites will be assumed to suggest a trade.

4. Start ALL titles with -  
**[W]** = Wanted  
**[O]** = Offering

5. Read the [starting out wiki page](/r/UsenetInvites/wiki/startingout) prior to creating any [W] posts.

6. Indexers in the [No Movement List](/r/UsenetInvites/wiki/nomovement) cannot be offered or wanted.

7. **Don't be a dick.** Read and understand [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). Then read it again.

8. **See rule #1** This is not the place to discuss content that you have illegally obtained or wish to obtain.  We will not tolerate repeat offenders and are ban happy when it comes to this rule.

#Be Careful!#

Please be careful with whom you invite!  Usually invites are linked. If you invite someone, it's because you know them and trust they won't do anything stupid.

Think of invites like a pyramid, if someone at the bottom of your pyramid screws up, and the admins remove that account, it will remove all the accounts that are linked to it.

#Site Admins#

Is offering invites against your site rules? [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FUsenetInvites) to request offending posts be removed.  We will take action as quickly as we can. 

Additionally, we can add rules to our automated moderation system to remove posts and comments requesting or offering invites for your site.  [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FUsenetInvites) and we will review your request to add your site to the filter list."
